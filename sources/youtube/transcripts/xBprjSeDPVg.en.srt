1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,470

And let's remember. So now we're moving

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
And let's remember. So now we're moving
 

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,349
And let's remember. So now we're moving
towards the felonaza.

4
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
towards the felonaza.
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,470
towards the felonaza.
It's a little more complicated field

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
It's a little more complicated field
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,350
It's a little more complicated field
than the cultivation set. Some of the

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
than the cultivation set. Some of the
 

9
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,629
than the cultivation set. Some of the
things that are there, the timing window

10
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
things that are there, the timing window
 

11
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,070
things that are there, the timing window
of the third drill is here. But more

12
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
of the third drill is here. But more
 

13
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,269
of the third drill is here. But more
importantly, that need for a constant

14
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
importantly, that need for a constant
 

15
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,390
importantly, that need for a constant
fluctuation

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400

 

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,070

especially on the curve. So in the um

18
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
especially on the curve. So in the um
 

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,670
especially on the curve. So in the um
drill set things are linear

20
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
drill set things are linear
 

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,150
drill set things are linear
and there's no real need for a constant

22
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
and there's no real need for a constant
 

23
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,470
and there's no real need for a constant
fluctuation because the pressure doesn't

24
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
fluctuation because the pressure doesn't
 

25
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,430
fluctuation because the pressure doesn't
ever change in this vector. Okay. So

26
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440

 

27
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,270

this is the drill of the c cultivation

28
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
this is the drill of the c cultivation
 

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,670
this is the drill of the c cultivation
set. But as I

30
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
set. But as I
 

31
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,069
set. But as I
start to move, I get his centers

32
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
start to move, I get his centers
 

33
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,990
start to move, I get his centers
pressing into me. So it kind of happens

34
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
pressing into me. So it kind of happens
 

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,150
pressing into me. So it kind of happens
by default, which is what makes it a

36
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
by default, which is what makes it a
 

37
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,470
by default, which is what makes it a
cultivation drill. But as as we're

38
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
cultivation drill. But as as we're
 

39
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,350
cultivation drill. But as as we're
moving, I am still moving that center.

40
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
moving, I am still moving that center.
 

41
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,390
moving, I am still moving that center.
So likewise,

42
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
So likewise,
 

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,950
So likewise,
he pushes. He's still going that way and

44
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
he pushes. He's still going that way and
 

45
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,590
he pushes. He's still going that way and
that is still being grounded. So he

46
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
that is still being grounded. So he
 

47
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,710
that is still being grounded. So he
can't go that way. So the rate you could

48
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
can't go that way. So the rate you could
 

49
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,510
can't go that way. So the rate you could
you could show it. The the rate is that

50
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
you could show it. The the rate is that
 

51
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,950
you could show it. The the rate is that
I am letting him in. So let's say he

52
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
I am letting him in. So let's say he
 

53
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,990
I am letting him in. So let's say he
wants to run past me. He he can't. He

54
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
wants to run past me. He he can't. He
 

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,070
wants to run past me. He he can't. He
goes in at the rate that I'm letting him

56
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
goes in at the rate that I'm letting him
 

57
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,429
goes in at the rate that I'm letting him
in. I control his rate. Okay. So

58
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
in. I control his rate. Okay. So
 

59
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,109
in. I control his rate. Okay. So
likewise if Sean comes around

60
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
likewise if Sean comes around
 

61
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,630
likewise if Sean comes around
and

62
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
and
 

63
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,550
and
I am not doing an anatomical

64
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
I am not doing an anatomical
 

65
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,350
I am not doing an anatomical
uh there's no skeletal

66
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
uh there's no skeletal
 

67
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,990
uh there's no skeletal
alignment here. You see? And so Sean's

68
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
alignment here. You see? And so Sean's
 

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,910
alignment here. You see? And so Sean's
added force. He just feels that same

70
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
added force. He just feels that same
 

71
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,910
added force. He just feels that same
back foot as he's not going to shove me

72
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
back foot as he's not going to shove me
 

73
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,830
back foot as he's not going to shove me
at some weird angle because I was

74
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
at some weird angle because I was
 

75
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,149
at some weird angle because I was
bracing on this angle. You see that?

76
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
bracing on this angle. You see that?
 

77
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,270
bracing on this angle. You see that?
Okay. So, uh, we'll just do discovery

78
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
Okay. So, uh, we'll just do discovery
 

79
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,870
Okay. So, uh, we'll just do discovery
learning

80
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
learning
 

81
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,870
learning
that way.

82
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
that way.
 

83
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,910
that way.
Okay. You control the So, the guy's

84
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
Okay. You control the So, the guy's
 

85
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,150
Okay. You control the So, the guy's
driving

86
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
driving
 

87
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,309
driving
and you decide the rate at which he

88
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
and you decide the rate at which he
 

89
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,390
and you decide the rate at which he
goes. the other guy's pushing on you and

90
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
goes. the other guy's pushing on you and
 

91
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,630
goes. the other guy's pushing on you and
you'll feel I'm doing everything the

92
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
you'll feel I'm doing everything the
 

93
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,150
you'll feel I'm doing everything the
same on the inside. So Sean can't push

94
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
same on the inside. So Sean can't push
 

95
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,949
same on the inside. So Sean can't push
that way

96
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
that way
 

97
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,430
that way
and Chris is is irrelevant to whatever

98
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
and Chris is is irrelevant to whatever
 

99
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,710
and Chris is is irrelevant to whatever
I'm doing. Okay, just to see what Oh

100
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm doing. Okay, just to see what Oh
 

101
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,510
I'm doing. Okay, just to see what Oh
yeah, that's they took away skeletal

102
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,520
yeah, that's they took away skeletal
 

103
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,150
yeah, that's they took away skeletal
alignment there is this constant need.

104
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
alignment there is this constant need.
 

105
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,550
alignment there is this constant need.
Now how do you do two angles? You can't

106
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
Now how do you do two angles? You can't
 

107
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,110
Now how do you do two angles? You can't
do two angles with whatever we were

108
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
do two angles with whatever we were
 

109
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,309
do two angles with whatever we were
thinking in the linear applications.

110
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
thinking in the linear applications.
 

111
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,990
thinking in the linear applications.
Okay. All right. Try just to see what

112
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay. All right. Try just to see what
 

113
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:00,630
Okay. All right. Try just to see what
you're experiencing.

114
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640

 

115
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,470

You see that two angles like right away

116
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
You see that two angles like right away
 

117
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,910
You see that two angles like right away
you'll go, "Fuck, I was doing something

118
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
you'll go, "Fuck, I was doing something
 

119
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,270
you'll go, "Fuck, I was doing something
else." So yeah, that's good. As long as

120
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
else." So yeah, that's good. As long as
 

121
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:17,030
else." So yeah, that's good. As long as
we discover it.

122
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040

 

123
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,190

Here. Uh, I can take we can go over

124
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
Here. Uh, I can take we can go over
 

125
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:53,830
Here. Uh, I can take we can go over
here.

126
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840

 

127
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,390

You're not you're not following him. You

128
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
You're not you're not following him. You
 

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:11,910
You're not you're not following him. You
have a whole different job.

130
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920

 

131
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,670

All right, everyone feel what we're

132
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
All right, everyone feel what we're
 

133
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,030
All right, everyone feel what we're
talking about? Okay, keep going. Keep

134
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
talking about? Okay, keep going. Keep
 

135
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:34,790
talking about? Okay, keep going. Keep
training.

136
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800

 

137
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,270

And it's important like

138
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280

 

139
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,629

I I just pick a vector. I'm not I'm not

140
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
I I just pick a vector. I'm not I'm not
 

141
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,790
I I just pick a vector. I'm not I'm not
in the I'm not in whatever he's doing.

142
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
in the I'm not in whatever he's doing.
 

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,469
in the I'm not in whatever he's doing.
You understand? So he his shoulder is

144
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
You understand? So he his shoulder is
 

145
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,030
You understand? So he his shoulder is
turning. I will turn around. That's

146
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
turning. I will turn around. That's
 

147
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,430
turning. I will turn around. That's
that's another vector. But I may touch

148
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
that's another vector. But I may touch
 

149
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,670
that's another vector. But I may touch
something over there.

150
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680

 

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,510

Got it. Don't let my hands slip.

152
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
Got it. Don't let my hands slip.
 

153
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,710
Got it. Don't let my hands slip.
So I go, you can keep moving. I'm just

154
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
So I go, you can keep moving. I'm just
 

155
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,629
So I go, you can keep moving. I'm just
here.

156
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
here.
 

157
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,950
here.
Okay. All right. And you can see, whoa,

158
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
Okay. All right. And you can see, whoa,
 

159
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,629
Okay. All right. And you can see, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Just lots of forces are

160
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
whoa, whoa. Just lots of forces are
 

161
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,590
whoa, whoa. Just lots of forces are
acting on this. Okay. So that's why you

162
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
acting on this. Okay. So that's why you
 

163
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,670
acting on this. Okay. So that's why you
got to go back and do the other drill

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
try it again. If you if you go to the
 

329
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,470
try it again. If you if you go to the
spiritual level, why did I get pushed

330
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
spiritual level, why did I get pushed
 

331
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,430
spiritual level, why did I get pushed
back? Because I'm pushing in. Why am I

332
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
back? Because I'm pushing in. Why am I
 

333
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,470
back? Because I'm pushing in. Why am I
pushing in? I'm trying to keep control.

334
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
pushing in? I'm trying to keep control.
 

335
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:57,509
pushing in? I'm trying to keep control.
Okay, let's go.

336
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519

 

337
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,069

We're we're now in Kihog. So you do what

338
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
We're we're now in Kihog. So you do what
 

339
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:34,710
We're we're now in Kihog. So you do what
it takes using the engine you have.

340
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720

 

341
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,350

Watch your uh toes pointing out away

342
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
Watch your uh toes pointing out away
 

343
00:12:37,360 --> 00:13:03,509
Watch your uh toes pointing out away
from each other.

344
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519

 

345
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,030

All right.

346
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040

 

347
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,629

So,

348
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
So,
 

349
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,350
So,
I have my grid

350
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
I have my grid
 

351
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,030
I have my grid
here. Where how much in can this elbow

352
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
here. Where how much in can this elbow
 

353
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,990
here. Where how much in can this elbow
go in the in on this spiral

354
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
go in the in on this spiral
 

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,710
go in the in on this spiral
to the to the yin? The hand can go to

356
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
to the to the yin? The hand can go to
 

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,790
to the to the yin? The hand can go to
the Wuji line, but it can't cross over.

358
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
the Wuji line, but it can't cross over.
 

359
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,310
the Wuji line, but it can't cross over.
Okay.

360
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
Okay.
 

361
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,310
Okay.
So here

362
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
So here
 

363
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,910
So here
I can hold that. So I don't need to

364
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
I can hold that. So I don't need to
 

365
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,310
I can hold that. So I don't need to
start. If I feel pressure, I just start

366
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
start. If I feel pressure, I just start
 

367
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,110
start. If I feel pressure, I just start
turning it already. Okay. And I move the

368
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
turning it already. Okay. And I move the
 

369
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,430
turning it already. Okay. And I move the
elbow to the inline and this hing.

370
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440

 

371
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,710

was doing it earlier. Same thing. But

372
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
was doing it earlier. Same thing. But
 

373
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,389
was doing it earlier. Same thing. But
even earlier, I'm not getting out of the

374
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
even earlier, I'm not getting out of the
 

375
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,030
even earlier, I'm not getting out of the
way. See, I'm in his shoulders. Even

376
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
way. See, I'm in his shoulders. Even
 

377
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,750
way. See, I'm in his shoulders. Even
earlier, I whenever he's touching, I'm

378
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
earlier, I whenever he's touching, I'm
 

379
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,829
earlier, I whenever he's touching, I'm
moving the center. Making that center

380
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
moving the center. Making that center
 

381
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,629
moving the center. Making that center
move. It was here. It got to there.

382
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
move. It was here. It got to there.
 

383
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,389
move. It was here. It got to there.
That's all I need to traverse the mat

384
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
That's all I need to traverse the mat
 

385
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,269
That's all I need to traverse the mat
here in position. Okay. Leave it there.

386
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
here in position. Okay. Leave it there.
 

387
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,189
here in position. Okay. Leave it there.
Pull the shoulders. Not kazushi till the

388
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
Pull the shoulders. Not kazushi till the
 

389
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,269
Pull the shoulders. Not kazushi till the
shoulders pull on the center. Okay. Try

390
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
shoulders pull on the center. Okay. Try
 

391
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,990
shoulders pull on the center. Okay. Try
it again.

392
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000

 

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,189

Pay attention to the elbow and the grid.

394
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199

 

395
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:28,230

And make sure you get there, though.

396
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240

 

397
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,389

You're on your toes.

398
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399

 

399
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,150

So, it's too You should have turned them

400
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
So, it's too You should have turned them
 

401
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,790
So, it's too You should have turned them
earlier. So, I Let me Maybe I'm not

402
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
earlier. So, I Let me Maybe I'm not
 

403
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,310
earlier. So, I Let me Maybe I'm not
being clear.

404
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320

 

405
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,110

In the coq set, we are training for the

406
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
In the coq set, we are training for the
 

407
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,629
In the coq set, we are training for the
skill. There's less application

408
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639

 

409
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,629

in those things, especially like drills.

410
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
in those things, especially like drills.
 

411
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,470
in those things, especially like drills.
Let's take the standing meditation off

412
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
Let's take the standing meditation off
 

413
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,230
Let's take the standing meditation off
since that always confuses me. Okay, so

414
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
since that always confuses me. Okay, so
 

415
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,269
since that always confuses me. Okay, so
the drill one, we hold it, right? You

416
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
the drill one, we hold it, right? You
 

417
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,870
the drill one, we hold it, right? You
hold it. You let the pressure

418
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
hold it. You let the pressure
 

419
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,670
hold it. You let the pressure
accumulate. Okay, you're trying to

420
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
accumulate. Okay, you're trying to
 

421
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,710
accumulate. Okay, you're trying to
increase your skill. So you you hold as

422
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
increase your skill. So you you hold as
 

423
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,829
increase your skill. So you you hold as
much as you can, as long as you can. And

424
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
much as you can, as long as you can. And
 

425
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,670
much as you can, as long as you can. And
then drill two, we actually increase the

426
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
then drill two, we actually increase the
 

427
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,710
then drill two, we actually increase the
weight by making you go forward. Okay?

428
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
weight by making you go forward. Okay?
 

429
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,710
weight by making you go forward. Okay?
We're not doing that kind of training

430
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
We're not doing that kind of training
 

431
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,430
We're not doing that kind of training
right now. Right now, we're trying to

432
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
right now. Right now, we're trying to
 

433
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,790
right now. Right now, we're trying to
use not increase the engine. We're

434
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
use not increase the engine. We're
 

435
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,910
use not increase the engine. We're
trying to use the engine you have. Do do

436
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
trying to use the engine you have. Do do
 

437
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,910
trying to use the engine you have. Do do
you understand that difference? Okay. So

438
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
you understand that difference? Okay. So
 

439
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,069
you understand that difference? Okay. So
that means I know what I'm supposed to

440
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
that means I know what I'm supposed to
 

441
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,910
that means I know what I'm supposed to
do

442
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
do
 

443
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,389
do
and I should have never got here.

444
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
and I should have never got here.
 

445
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,269
and I should have never got here.
My engine got displaced right away, but

446
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
My engine got displaced right away, but
 

447
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,670
My engine got displaced right away, but
my engine should have gone here. Do you

448
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
my engine should have gone here. Do you
 

449
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,189
my engine should have gone here. Do you
get? So, there should be no time where

450
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
get? So, there should be no time where
 

451
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,750
get? So, there should be no time where
I'm shaking now or anything. But at the

452
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
I'm shaking now or anything. But at the
 

453
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,150
I'm shaking now or anything. But at the
same time, I'm still using the same

454
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
same time, I'm still using the same
 

455
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,550
same time, I'm still using the same
engine and still achieving the same

456
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
engine and still achieving the same
 

457
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,150
engine and still achieving the same
goals. Okay? Because

458
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
goals. Okay? Because
 

459
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,150
goals. Okay? Because
there's no such thing as your once and

460
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
there's no such thing as your once and
 

461
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,790
there's no such thing as your once and
for all engine

462
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
for all engine
 

463
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,629
for all engine
that's universally going to address

464
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
that's universally going to address
 

465
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,350
that's universally going to address
every that. That's not true. Not true at

466
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
every that. That's not true. Not true at
 

467
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,310
every that. That's not true. Not true at
all. Okay. different fighters, different

468
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
all. Okay. different fighters, different
 

469
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,629
all. Okay. different fighters, different
surfaces, different

470
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
surfaces, different
 

471
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,470
surfaces, different
times of the day, all that kind of

472
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
times of the day, all that kind of
 

473
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,110
times of the day, all that kind of
changes, but I still work the same

474
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
changes, but I still work the same
 

475
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,829
changes, but I still work the same
engine. Okay? So, I shouldn't see any

476
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
engine. Okay? So, I shouldn't see any
 

477
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,110
engine. Okay? So, I shouldn't see any
shaking, no compromisation,

478
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
shaking, no compromisation,
 

479
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,110
shaking, no compromisation,
no, they shouldn't be there. I shouldn't

480
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
no, they shouldn't be there. I shouldn't
 

481
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,269
no, they shouldn't be there. I shouldn't
be in their shoulders. Got it? Okay.

482
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
be in their shoulders. Got it? Okay.
 

483
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:32,310
be in their shoulders. Got it? Okay.
Let's put it all together in Khan. Now,

484
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320

 

485
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,230

pay attention to the grid. Don't let

486
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
pay attention to the grid. Don't let
 

487
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,470
pay attention to the grid. Don't let
your Don't let him close your elbow

488
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
your Don't let him close your elbow

I'm doing in the cultivation set. So
 

741
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,029

here, I don't want to stop them. You're

subtle as when we did the fingertip
pull. But if you keep the transfer

751
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,750

going, you're going to see there's more

763
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,470

the shape in there shape becomes
 

831
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,590
the shape in there shape becomes
relevant because we're more closer to

get out of this wrist,
 

927
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,550
get out of this wrist,
we'd have his arm somewhere like this,

we'd have his arm somewhere like this,

It's not going to get out slipping this
 

937

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,150
the adhesion, you'll watch his elbow
wrist change relationship. Do you see

994
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
wrist change relationship. Do you see
 

995
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,829
wrist change relationship. Do you see
that? Stop. There's that same thing we

996
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
that? Stop. There's that same thing we
 

997
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,310
that? Stop. There's that same thing we
did yesterday. The hand is outside the

998
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
did yesterday. The hand is outside the
 

999
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,430
did yesterday. The hand is outside the
elbow. If you do the flat circle, the

1000
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
elbow. If you do the flat circle, the
 

1001
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,349
elbow. If you do the flat circle, the
hand stays in alignment with the elbow,

1002
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
hand stays in alignment with the elbow,
 

1003
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,870
hand stays in alignment with the elbow,
which means the elbow is anchored and

1004
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880
which means the elbow is anchored and
 

1005
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,550
which means the elbow is anchored and
there's his power, which means you're in

1006
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
there's his power, which means you're in
 

1007
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,470
there's his power, which means you're in
the shoulders and not in the center.

1008
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
the shoulders and not in the center.
 

1009

the shoulders and not in the center.
Okay? So, I know we do that all the time

1010
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:09,760
Okay? So, I know we do that all the time
 

1011
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,310
Okay? So, I know we do that all the time
or we see it all the time. But here, I

1012
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:12,320
or we see it all the time. But here, I
 

1013
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,750
or we see it all the time. But here, I
can't get in. Okay? You have to take

1014
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
can't get in. Okay? You have to take
 

1015
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,870
can't get in. Okay? You have to take
that boom this way. Okay? Does that make

1016
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:18,880
that boom this way. Okay? Does that make
 

1017
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,829
that boom this way. Okay? Does that make
sense? And again, if you're just working

1018
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:21,839
sense? And again, if you're just working
 

1019
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,790
sense? And again, if you're just working
in with you,

1020
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800

 

1021
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,790

you're that's all I'm doing. I'm just

1022
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:28,800
you're that's all I'm doing. I'm just
 

1023
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,190
you're that's all I'm doing. I'm just
doing this exercise. Okay? And then he's

1025

doing this exercise. Okay? And then he's
just

1026
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,040
just
 

1027
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,349
just
whatever he's inconsequential.

Good. And let go of it. I mean,
mentally, too.

1320
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559

 

1321
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:19,829

You

1322
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839

 

1323
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,829

and don't fall out of it. Settle into

1324
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:21,839
and don't fall out of it. Settle into
 

1325
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,470
and don't fall out of it. Settle into
it. Settle. Let go. Settle.

1326
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,480
it. Settle. Let go. Settle.
 

1327
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,750
it. Settle. Let go. Settle.

Let go. Settle. Just settle. Let go.

1332
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839

 

1333
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:34,870

Let go. Stop touching.

1334
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880

 

1335
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,620

I go ahead.

1336
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:37,630
I go ahead.
 

1337
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:47,750
I go ahead.
[Music]

1338
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760

 

1339
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,109

more.

1340
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119

 

1341
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,069

Okay. So, um

1342
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
Okay. So, um
 

1343
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,309
Okay. So, um
again, these are things you know, right,

1344
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
again, these are things you know, right,
 

1345
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,710
again, these are things you know, right,
when you're fighting people that want to

1346
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
when you're fighting people that want to
 

1347
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,750
when you're fighting people that want to
kill you or want to get away. I know

1348
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
kill you or want to get away. I know
 

1349
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,109
kill you or want to get away. I know
this looks like you're in the back. You

1350
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
this looks like you're in the back. You
 

1351
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,270
this looks like you're in the back. You
know what I'm talking about.

1352
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:07,280
know what I'm talking about.
 

1353
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,829
know what I'm talking about.
Um but this is a quick a quick out. So

1354
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
Um but this is a quick a quick out. So
 

1355
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,670
Um but this is a quick a quick out. So
now I'm not saying

1356
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
now I'm not saying
 

1357
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,950
now I'm not saying
if we're here and he uh does not turn

1358
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
if we're here and he uh does not turn
 

1359
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,190
if we're here and he uh does not turn
but I turn now I'm not either. So

1360
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,200
but I turn now I'm not either. So
 

1361
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,270
but I turn now I'm not either. So
usually what happens is this is where we

1362
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,280
usually what happens is this is where we
 

1363
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,150
usually what happens is this is where we
are and then he will come with me. You

1364
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
are and then he will come with me. You
 

1365
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,829
are and then he will come with me. You
get it?

1366
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
get it?
 

1367
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,630
get it?
But at that turn he's not. And as I keep

1368
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
But at that turn he's not. And as I keep
 

1369
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,790
But at that turn he's not. And as I keep
turning, I even if I bring him with me,

1370
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:42,800
turning, I even if I bring him with me,
 

1371
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,710
turning, I even if I bring him with me,
he's not

1372
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
he's not
 

1373
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,950
he's not
I brought he moved when I moved, but now

1374
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:46,960
I brought he moved when I moved, but now
 

1375
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,790
I brought he moved when I moved, but now
I'm clearly not in the back. Okay.

1376
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:50,800
I'm clearly not in the back. Okay.
 

1377
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,470
I'm clearly not in the back. Okay.
So to do this,

1378
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
So to do this,
 

1379
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,549
So to do this,
this will kind of work. It'll work

1380
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
this will kind of work. It'll work
 

1381
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,549
this will kind of work. It'll work
further in the radius. Here I am spy to

1382
00:54:58,549 --> 00:54:58,559
further in the radius. Here I am spy to
 

1383
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,549
further in the radius. Here I am spy to
spot. Okay. And I turn and I'm staying

1384
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:02,559
spot. Okay. And I turn and I'm staying
 

1385
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,790
spot. Okay. And I turn and I'm staying
with him. And as I keep turning, no, now

1386
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:06,800
with him. And as I keep turning, no, now
 

1387
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,790
with him. And as I keep turning, no, now
we're not. Now I'm not.

1388
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:10,800

 

1389
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,349

So like all things in fighting,

1390
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359

 

1391
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,030

you got to kind of have

1392
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
you got to kind of have
 

1393
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,349
you got to kind of have
preparation for the failure rate and the

1394
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
preparation for the failure rate and the
 

1395
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,750
preparation for the failure rate and the
contestation.

1396
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
contestation.
 

1397
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,069
contestation.
So you're over here. So now when I turn,

1398
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
So you're over here. So now when I turn,
 

1399
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,870
So you're over here. So now when I turn,
he stay he stay with me. No matter how

1400
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
he stay he stay with me. No matter how
 

1401
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,950
he stay he stay with me. No matter how
much I turn, I will not get back onto

1402
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:34,960
much I turn, I will not get back onto
 

1403
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,870
much I turn, I will not get back onto
this angle over here. Okay? So, in this

1404
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
this angle over here. Okay? So, in this
 

1405
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,630
this angle over here. Okay? So, in this
drill,

1406
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
drill,
 

1407
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,589
drill,
I am going to

1408
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
I am going to
 

1409
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,870
I am going to
go past what you think is the back. And

1410
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:46,880
go past what you think is the back. And
 

1411
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,349
go past what you think is the back. And
so, the metric I gave you was here's his

1412
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
so, the metric I gave you was here's his
 

1413
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,390
so, the metric I gave you was here's his
spine, here's my spine. You see that?

1414
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
spine, here's my spine. You see that?
 

1415
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:06,340
spine, here's my spine. You see that?
Okay. All right. Try it again.

1416
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:06,350

 

1417
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,510

You got to move him past.

1420
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,400
You got to move him past.
 

1421
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:22,870
You got to move him past.
You got to get on the elbow.

1422
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880

 

1423
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,270

And in this drill, we're just letting go

1424
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:25,280
And in this drill, we're just letting go
 

1425
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:37,190
And in this drill, we're just letting go
and emotionally too.

1426
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200

 

1427
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,630

And we only get one ED, right? Not two.

1428
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
And we only get one ED, right? Not two.
 

1429
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,109
And we only get one ED, right? Not two.
Not two steps. We don't get two steps.

1430
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:45,119
Not two steps. We don't get two steps.
 

1431
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,870
Not two steps. We don't get two steps.
We don't get two steps.

1432
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880

 

1433
00:56:48,880 --> 00:57:08,230

That's it. Yep. Perfect.

1434
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:08,240

 

1435
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,589

Release more back there.

1436
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:11,599
Release more back there.
 

1437
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,030
Release more back there.
Slip.

1438
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,040

 

1439
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,150

Keep the center moving. Keep it moving.

1440
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,160

 

1441
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:32,470

And release.

1442
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480

 

1443
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,950

Only one step.

1444
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
Only one step.
 

1445
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,990
Only one step.
Okay. Uh, a general rule that we have is

1446
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay. Uh, a general rule that we have is
 

1447
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,150
Okay. Uh, a general rule that we have is
like the barbell. I expect it to act

1448
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,160
like the barbell. I expect it to act
 

1449
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,150
like the barbell. I expect it to act
like a barbell until I put it back on

1450
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:42,160
like a barbell until I put it back on
 

1451
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,789
like a barbell until I put it back on
the rack. then the bar I don't care what

1452
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
the rack. then the bar I don't care what
 

1453
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,870
the rack. then the bar I don't care what
the barbell does. So the same thing with

1454
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
the barbell does. So the same thing with
 

1455
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,150
the barbell does. So the same thing with
my UK. The nag decides when the UK is

1456
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,160
my UK. The nag decides when the UK is
 

1457
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,109
my UK. The nag decides when the UK is
out of the technique that UK doesn't go

1458
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
out of the technique that UK doesn't go
 

1459
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,030
out of the technique that UK doesn't go
I'm out and leaves. Maybe I'm not done

1460
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:55,040
I'm out and leaves. Maybe I'm not done
 

1461
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,150
I'm out and leaves. Maybe I'm not done
settling. Okay. So the nag decides when

1462
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,160
settling. Okay. So the nag decides when
 

1463
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,870
settling. Okay. So the nag decides when
or out. You can either move and he can

1464
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:02,880
or out. You can either move and he can
 

1465
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,470
or out. You can either move and he can
see that you moved. He heard that you

1466
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:04,480
see that you moved. He heard that you
 

1467
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,230
see that you moved. He heard that you
moved. You can tap them whatever. But

1468
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
moved. You can tap them whatever. But
 

1469
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,670
moved. You can tap them whatever. But
they're going to hang out there till you

1470
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:07,680
they're going to hang out there till you
 

1471
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,270
they're going to hang out there till you
get to where you're doing the drill.

1472
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:09,280
get to where you're doing the drill.
 

1473
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:23,190
get to where you're doing the drill.
Okay. Go.

1474
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,200

 

1475
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,630

And at this point, we're letting go.

1476
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640
And at this point, we're letting go.
 

1477
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:32,950
And at this point, we're letting go.
You're just way too close.

1478
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960

 

1479
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:40,309

Relax everything.

1480

01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
that step natural? No. Is that Is that
 

1805
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,350
that step natural? No. Is that Is that
ever seen any athlete do that and be

1806
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
ever seen any athlete do that and be
 

1807
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,870
ever seen any athlete do that and be
ready to do something else right after

1808
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:00,880
ready to do something else right after
 

1809
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,350
ready to do something else right after
that? No. Okay. It's just too

1810
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
that? No. Okay. It's just too
 

1811
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,790
that? No. Okay. It's just too
compromising. All right. Um, so even if

1812
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:06,800
compromising. All right. Um, so even if
 

1813
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,590
compromising. All right. Um, so even if
I could get there, I have even with this

1814
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:09,600
I could get there, I have even with this
 

1815
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,669
I could get there, I have even with this
variation, it's now not marshall

1816
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
variation, it's now not marshall
 

1817
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,750
variation, it's now not marshall
anymore. It's not natural. All right.

1818
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:13,760
anymore. It's not natural. All right.
 

1819
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,790
anymore. It's not natural. All right.
We'll do this exercise now.

1820
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
We'll do this exercise now.
 

1821
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,229
We'll do this exercise now.
Okay.

1822
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239

 

1823
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:23,830

So, I was just standing still and just

1824
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:23,840
So, I was just standing still and just
 

1825
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,870
So, I was just standing still and just
hold me, right? Okay. Well, now let me

1826
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
hold me, right? Okay. Well, now let me
 

1827
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,709
hold me, right? Okay. Well, now let me
move forward.

1828
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:30,719
move forward.
 

1829
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,030
move forward.
Try to try to get to the same place.

1830
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
Try to try to get to the same place.
 

1831
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,149
Try to try to get to the same place.
Okay. Yeah.

1832
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:36,159
Okay. Yeah.
 

1833
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,590
Okay. Yeah.
Got got the idea. Okay.

1834
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
Got got the idea. Okay.
 

1835
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:49,830
Got got the idea. Okay.
So, he has to do Yashi that way.

1836
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:49,840

 

1837
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:57,669

He's going to do the technique.

1838
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679

 

1839
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,750

Am I

1840
01:12:59,750 --> 01:12:59,760
Am I
 

1841
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,189
Am I
No, I just walk.

1842
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199

 

1843
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,550

Okay. Try it.

1844
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:08,560
Okay. Try it.
 

1845
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,990
Okay. Try it.
You're going to try to bring that.

1846
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
You're going to try to bring that.
 

1847
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,750
You're going to try to bring that.
You're going to try to hit that to your

1848
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
You're going to try to hit that to your
 

1849
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,350
You're going to try to hit that to your
center. Do you understand? You're going

1850
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,360
center. Do you understand? You're going
 

1851
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,990
center. Do you understand? You're going
to try to get to your center. I just

1852
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,000
to try to get to your center. I just
 

1853
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,430
to try to get to your center. I just
want you to do it at a walking pace

1854
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:17,440
want you to do it at a walking pace
 

1855
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,430
want you to do it at a walking pace
right now.

1856
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440
right now.
 

1857
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:44,790
right now.
It might get you, it might not.

1858
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,800

 

1859
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,470

You're you're going to try to hold on

1860
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,480
You're you're going to try to hold on
 

1861
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,189
You're you're going to try to hold on
and try to turn them to your power arc.

1862
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
and try to turn them to your power arc.
 

1863
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:55,590
and try to turn them to your power arc.
Hold on. Turn them to your power arc.

1864
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600

 

1865
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:04,070

[Music]

1866
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080

 

1867
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,709

Okay. So even if you could not get a

1868
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:06,719
Okay. So even if you could not get a
 

1869
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,750
Okay. So even if you could not get a
grab, you got a good key grab or or

1870
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:09,760
grab, you got a good key grab or or
 

1871
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,149
grab, you got a good key grab or or
whatever, you can still feel the the

1872
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
whatever, you can still feel the the
 

1873
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,430
whatever, you can still feel the the
contestation, right? Okay. So if we if

1874
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:15,440
contestation, right? Okay. So if we if
 

1875
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,990
contestation, right? Okay. So if we if
we can, we'll just up the energy a

1876
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
we can, we'll just up the energy a
 

1877
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,830
we can, we'll just up the energy a
little bit. Okay. So instead of just

1878
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
little bit. Okay. So instead of just
 

1879
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,470
little bit. Okay. So instead of just
walking, I'm now running fast.

1880
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
walking, I'm now running fast.
 

1881
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:30,149
walking, I'm now running fast.
Okay. Try it.

1882
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:30,159

 

1883
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:36,070

I've done a good job. Really?

1884
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,080

 

1885
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:57,030

You got to try and get the shoulders.

1886
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:57,040

 

1887
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,390

Okay. So, we get kind of a shoulder grab

1888
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:00,400
Okay. So, we get kind of a shoulder grab
 

1889
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:07,830
Okay. So, we get kind of a shoulder grab
going on here. We'll watch.

1890
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840

 

1891
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,830

Okay, so we kind of got it. Kind of. But

1892
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:11,840
Okay, so we kind of got it. Kind of. But
 

1893
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,750
Okay, so we kind of got it. Kind of. But
how did we get there? Let's look at it.

1894
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:19,760

 

1895
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,550

Where is he actually entering now? Over

1896
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
Where is he actually entering now? Over
 

1897
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,790
Where is he actually entering now? Over
that way. Do you see that? So again, to

1898
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
that way. Do you see that? So again, to
 

1899
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,030
that way. Do you see that? So again, to
me, this is

1900
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
me, this is
 

1901
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,030
me, this is
it. It looks like you want to go. I got

1902
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,040
it. It looks like you want to go. I got
 

1903
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,990
it. It looks like you want to go. I got
it. But you proved my point because you

1904
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,000
it. But you proved my point because you
 

1905
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,470
it. But you proved my point because you
had to go that way. You can't go that

1906
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
had to go that way. You can't go that
 

1907
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,630
had to go that way. You can't go that
way. Your body didn't want to do it.

1908
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:38,640
way. Your body didn't want to do it.
 

1909
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,910
way. Your body didn't want to do it.
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. Um,

1910
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. Um,
 

1911
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,030
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. Um,
but even if we got it, I'm now chasing

1912
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
but even if we got it, I'm now chasing
 

1913
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,750
but even if we got it, I'm now chasing
someone and trying to stop them. I'm

1914
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
someone and trying to stop them. I'm
 

1915
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,669
someone and trying to stop them. I'm
still contesting. It's not the art.

1916
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
still contesting. It's not the art.
 

1917
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,830
still contesting. It's not the art.
Okay. And then from the Marshall point

1918
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
Okay. And then from the Marshall point
 

1919
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,470
Okay. And then from the Marshall point
of view, okay, you got my shoulders. Oh,

1920
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
of view, okay, you got my shoulders. Oh,
 

1921
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,310
of view, okay, you got my shoulders. Oh,
no. Here we go. Back back in. Double

1922
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
no. Here we go. Back back in. Double
 

1923
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,830
no. Here we go. Back back in. Double
lift. Okay. Um, it's nowhere near the

1924
01:15:59,830 --> 01:15:59,840
lift. Okay. Um, it's nowhere near the
 

1925
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,669
lift. Okay. Um, it's nowhere near the
vulnerability we think we're going to

1926
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:01,679
vulnerability we think we're going to
 

1927
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,350
vulnerability we think we're going to
get from all that other stuff. Okay.

1928
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:05,360
get from all that other stuff. Okay.
 

1929
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,830
get from all that other stuff. Okay.
So, I'm not I know you might smell

1930
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:09,840
So, I'm not I know you might smell
 

1931
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,270
So, I'm not I know you might smell
here, but I'm not doing that in I am

1932
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,280
here, but I'm not doing that in I am
 

1933
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,270
here, but I'm not doing that in I am
trying to generate the centrifugal

1934
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,280
trying to generate the centrifugal
 

1935
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,110
trying to generate the centrifugal
energy

1936
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,120
energy
 

1937
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,149
energy
here very incrementally

1938
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
here very incrementally
 

1939
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,030
here very incrementally
that I now use my body

1940
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
that I now use my body
 

1941
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,830
that I now use my body
to start it too. Do you get that? Okay.

1942
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:27,840
to start it too. Do you get that? Okay.
 

1943
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,790
to start it too. Do you get that? Okay.
And so now you see that the fight is ro

1944
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
And so now you see that the fight is ro
 

1945
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,950
And so now you see that the fight is ro
has rotated because we rotated here. We

1946
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:34,960
has rotated because we rotated here. We
 

1947
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,590
has rotated because we rotated here. We
war

1948
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:37,600
war
 

1949
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,270
war
oppositionally.

1950
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:39,280
oppositionally.
 

1951
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,189
oppositionally.
We're going to do what we do on the

1952
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:41,199
We're going to do what we do on the
 

1953
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,830
We're going to do what we do on the
inside on the ten on the hands. They

1954
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
inside on the ten on the hands. They
 

1955
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,070
inside on the ten on the hands. They
feeding each other. And how do you do

1956
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:46,080
feeding each other. And how do you do
 

1957
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,830
feeding each other. And how do you do
that? You rotate the cross. This is

1958
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
that? You rotate the cross. This is
 

1959
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,430
that? You rotate the cross. This is
where I am now. Okay. In this technique

1960
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
where I am now. Okay. In this technique
 

1961
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,990
where I am now. Okay. In this technique

01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,189

yin space comes up. That's when I follow

appreciate the box. We're good to Okay.
 

2293
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,950
appreciate the box. We're good to Okay.
And I'm going to use the same uh

2294
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:34,960
And I'm going to use the same uh
 

2295
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,870
And I'm going to use the same uh
downwardness

2296
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880
downwardness
 

2297
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,430
downwardness
of the cook. So, I don't want to pull

2298
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
of the cook. So, I don't want to pull
 

2299
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,669
of the cook. So, I don't want to pull
him back.

2300
01:28:41,669 --> 01:28:41,679
him back.
 

2301
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:44,950

I'm going to push him down this way. And

2302
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960
I'm going to push him down this way. And
 

2303
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,870
I'm going to push him down this way. And
I keep sending his butt to the ground.

2304
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
I keep sending his butt to the ground.
 

2305
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,830
I keep sending his butt to the ground.
Now he's gravity's working against me.

2306
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:51,840
Now he's gravity's working against me.
 

2307
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,910
Now he's gravity's working against me.
I'll show it for a little bit. Okay,

2308
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:55,920
I'll show it for a little bit. Okay,
 

2309
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,390
I'll show it for a little bit. Okay,
there it is. Okay,

01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
I'm in the back.
 

2315
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,030
I'm in the back.
I can't be on the side. Have to be in

01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
trachea in the middle of my arm.
 

2323
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:22,790
trachea in the middle of my arm.
Okay. Boom. Pop. Pull. Not enough. But

Okay. Boom. Pop. Pull. Not enough. But
 

2325
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,229
Okay. Boom. Pop. Pull. Not enough. But
I'll take the bar arm in this case

2326
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:26,239
I'll take the bar arm in this case
 

2327
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:29,030
I'll take the bar arm in this case
here. I'm chugging him forward with poke

2328
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
here. I'm chugging him forward with poke
 

2329
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:33,270

but I have to choke.
 

2333
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,229
but I have to choke.
Now he's falling into the bar arm. He'll

2334
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:38,239
Now he's falling into the bar arm. He'll
 

2335
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:44,070
Now he's falling into the bar arm. He'll
tap. Okay, let's do the bar arm.

2336
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080

 

2337
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:50,070

2339
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,669

You have to be in the middle. You got to

2340
01:29:51,669 --> 01:29:51,679
You have to be in the middle. You got to
 

2341
01:29:51,679 --> 01:30:00,310
You have to be in the middle. You got to
tap early. You got to let go quickly.

2342

2353
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,070

Okay. So, you have to show his feet out

2354
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
Okay. So, you have to show his feet out
 

2355
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,709
Okay. So, you have to show his feet out
that way. You see, you're doing that

2356
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719

2359
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:37,110
with your foot.
Okay. You pull someone backwards.

2360
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:37,120

 

2361
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,590

You pull me backwards. I just move

2362
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:39,600
You pull me backwards. I just move

backwards. You kiss me.
You said my center out you. That was it.

2366
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:45,840
You said my center out you. That was it.
 

2367
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,350
You said my center out you. That was it.
That was that right there on the crush

2368
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:47,360
That was that right there on the crush
 

2369
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,750
That was that right there on the crush
on the trace. Okay. So on him I went

2370
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:49,760
on the trace. Okay. So on him I went
 

2371
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,709
on the trace. Okay. So on him I went
down. I went down with him. So you got

2372
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:52,719
down. I went down with him. So you got
 

2373
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,709

to still protect each other. But the it
 

2375
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,709
to still protect each other. But the it
doesn't matter. The projection is his

2376
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:00,719
doesn't matter. The projection is his
 

2377
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:05,189
doesn't matter. The projection is his
center that way. Okay. Not back. Walk

2378
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:05,199
center that way. Okay. Not back. Walk
 

2379
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:14,650
center that way. Okay. Not back. Walk
him backwards. Okay. Try it again.

2380
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:14,660

Grab the back foot and project that

2384
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:20,320
Grab the back foot and project that
 

2385
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,830
Grab the back foot and project that
center forward. Don't pull him

2386
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:21,840
center forward. Don't pull him
 

2387
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:31,590
center forward. Don't pull him
backwards. That's it.

2388
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:31,600

 

2389
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,189

And you have to be in the back for this.

2390
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
And you have to be in the back for this.
 

2391
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:47,430
And you have to be in the back for this.
Yes, that's it.

2392
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,440

 

2393
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,110

You got aim for center. You missed it.

2394
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,120
You got aim for center. You missed it.
 

2395
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:59,110
You got aim for center. You missed it.
There you go.

2396
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,120

 

2397
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:19,189

Get a good base. Get a good base.

2398
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:19,199

 

2399
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,590

Yeah. See how he wants to sit on you.

2400
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
Yeah. See how he wants to sit on you.
 

2401
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:27,270
Yeah. See how he wants to sit on you.
You don't want him to sit on you.

2402
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280

 

2403
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,030

Don't kneel down. Let go. I'd rather you

2404
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
Don't kneel down. Let go. I'd rather you
 

2405
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:35,189
Don't kneel down. Let go. I'd rather you
let go.

2406
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:35,199

 

2407
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:36,709

There shouldn't be any weight coming

2408
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
There shouldn't be any weight coming
 

2409
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,149
There shouldn't be any weight coming
back to you, Chris. Right.

2410
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:40,159
back to you, Chris. Right.
 

2411
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:45,990
back to you, Chris. Right.
Let me see how you're pulling them back.

2412
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:46,000

 

2413
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,030

All right.

2414
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
All right.
 

2415
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,550
All right.
So,

2416
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
So,
 

2417
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,830
So,
as I said, right, I get projected out.

2418
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:53,840
as I said, right, I get projected out.
 

2419
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,990
as I said, right, I get projected out.
You get projected out. Okay? So, there

2420
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:56,000
You get projected out. Okay? So, there
 

2421
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,709
You get projected out. Okay? So, there
should never be weight that's coming

2422
01:32:58,709 --> 01:32:58,719
should never be weight that's coming
 

2423
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,350
should never be weight that's coming
back to me. And when I had him let it

2424
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
back to me. And when I had him let it
 

2425
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,270
back to me. And when I had him let it
loose, I let it loose going forward.

2426
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:03,280
loose, I let it loose going forward.
 

2427
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,510
loose, I let it loose going forward.
Okay? Because he is going forward and

2428
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
Okay? Because he is going forward and
 

2429
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,790
Okay? Because he is going forward and
sitting down hanging himself. Okay? But

2430
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:08,800
sitting down hanging himself. Okay? But
 

2431
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,390
sitting down hanging himself. Okay? But
you can see now, okay, that's hard, but

2432
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:12,400
you can see now, okay, that's hard, but
 

2433
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,709
you can see now, okay, that's hard, but
it's the same skill. Just a smaller

2434
01:33:14,709 --> 01:33:14,719
it's the same skill. Just a smaller
 

2435
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:18,149
it's the same skill. Just a smaller
window and multitasking of the yinyang.

2436
01:33:18,149 --> 01:33:18,159
window and multitasking of the yinyang.
 

2437
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,470
window and multitasking of the yinyang.
Okay. But it's the same projection

2438
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
Okay. But it's the same projection
 

2439
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,070
Okay. But it's the same projection
skill.

2440
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:22,080
skill.
 

2441
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,870
skill.
So going back to like the kids, we'll

2442
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:24,880
So going back to like the kids, we'll
 

2443
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,629
So going back to like the kids, we'll
get them in the ballpark and then later

2444
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:26,639
get them in the ballpark and then later
 

2445
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:29,189
get them in the ballpark and then later
we show them the techniques. All right?

2446
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:29,199
we show them the techniques. All right?
 

2447
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,750
we show them the techniques. All right?
So, let's look at this technique. We

2448
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:31,760
So, let's look at this technique. We
 

2449
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,870
So, let's look at this technique. We
just have him sit down.

2450
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:34,880
just have him sit down.
 

2451
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,950
just have him sit down.
Okay. And we're not doing any of the

2452
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:36,960
Okay. And we're not doing any of the
 

2453
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,390
Okay. And we're not doing any of the
mechanics right now. We're working on

2454
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,400
mechanics right now. We're working on
 

2455
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,629
mechanics right now. We're working on
just the bar arm choke. The bar arm

2456
01:33:40,629 --> 01:33:40,639
just the bar arm choke. The bar arm
 

2457
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,350
just the bar arm choke. The bar arm
choke is

2458
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
choke is
 

2459
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,390
choke is
every bit as lethal as a union.

2460
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,400
every bit as lethal as a union.
 

2461
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,070
every bit as lethal as a union.
You're going to take this forearm bone

2462
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,080
You're going to take this forearm bone
 

2463
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,030
You're going to take this forearm bone
right here and glide across the trachea.

2464
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
right here and glide across the trachea.
 

2465
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:57,750
right here and glide across the trachea.
You see that? We're not doing the el.

2466
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
You see that? We're not doing the el.
 

2467
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,910
You see that? We're not doing the el.
It's right here. You have to be busy

2468
01:33:59,910 --> 01:33:59,920
It's right here. You have to be busy
 

2469
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,510
It's right here. You have to be busy
legal. That's why you don't see it in

2470
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
legal. That's why you don't see it in
 

2471
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,750
legal. That's why you don't see it in
internet.

2472
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
internet.
 

2473
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,390
internet.
This is a different hand. This is where

2474
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:06,400
This is a different hand. This is where
 

2475
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:12,790
This is a different hand. This is where
I'm at. Then this hand is waiter's hand.

2476
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:12,800
I'm at. Then this hand is waiter's hand.
 

2477
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,990
I'm at. Then this hand is waiter's hand.
And I do this cable grip here. Cut my

2478
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
And I do this cable grip here. Cut my
 

2479
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,270
And I do this cable grip here. Cut my
hands. Grab my thumb here.

2480
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
hands. Grab my thumb here.
 

2481
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,350
hands. Grab my thumb here.
This elbow

2482
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,360
This elbow
 

2483
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,750
This elbow
goes down and he's going to try to pull

2484
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:25,760
goes down and he's going to try to pull
 

2485
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,430
goes down and he's going to try to pull
it.

2486
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:27,440
it.
 

2487
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,470
it.
He now pulls it into his back. Does that

2488
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
He now pulls it into his back. Does that
 

2489
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:36,310
He now pulls it into his back. Does that
make sense? Come here like that. Nope.

2490
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320

 

2491
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,149

He's going to pull it. He's going to try

2492
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:38,159
He's going to pull it. He's going to try
 

2493
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,629
He's going to pull it. He's going to try
to save his life.

2494
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:40,639
to save his life.
 

2495
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,030
to save his life.
So, I anchor this elbow. When he pulls

2496
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:43,040
So, I anchor this elbow. When he pulls
 

2497
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,950
So, I anchor this elbow. When he pulls
it, it goes into his back. You

2498
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:44,960
it, it goes into his back. You
 

2499
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,870
it, it goes into his back. You
understand? Okay. So, this is how we're

2500
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:46,880
understand? Okay. So, this is how we're
 

2501
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,149
understand? Okay. So, this is how we're
doing our get everything in place.

2502
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:50,159
doing our get everything in place.
 

2503
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:52,709
doing our get everything in place.

arm. You're like Dave is hanging off the
 

2603
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,030
arm. You're like Dave is hanging off the
side. It doesn't matter because it's

2604
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:31,040
side. It doesn't matter because it's
 

2605
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,870
side. It doesn't matter because it's
over here.

2606

01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,040
That is the attack. You see that?
 

2609
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,030
That is the attack. You see that?
There's a lot there is a lot of room.

2610
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
There's a lot there is a lot of room.
 

2611
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,629
There's a lot there is a lot of room.
Well, I fill that room up with my

2612
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:38,639
Well, I fill that room up with my
 

2613
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,870
Well, I fill that room up with my
shoulder. That's what keeps his head

2614
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:40,880
shoulder. That's what keeps his head
 

2615
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,590
shoulder. That's what keeps his head
there. Don't fill it up with your elbow.

2616
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:43,600
there. Don't fill it up with your elbow.
 

2617
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,149
there. Don't fill it up with your elbow.
Okay. Down is on the fleshy part.

01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
immediate resistance like the bone on
 

2623
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,990
immediate resistance like the bone on
this. Okay,

2624
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,000
this. Okay,
 

2625
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,629
this. Okay,

shoulder. If you don't do that, people
 

2629
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,350
shoulder. If you don't do that, people
can start trying to lift the elbow and

2630
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
can start trying to lift the elbow and
 

2631
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,910
can start trying to lift the elbow and
slip out the back there. Okay. So, you

2632
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:03,920
slip out the back there. Okay. So, you
 

2633
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,870
slip out the back there. Okay. So, you
feel the space

2634
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:06,880
feel the space
 

2635
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,790
feel the space
shoulder. You can get your head there,

2636
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:08,800
shoulder. You can get your head there,
 

2637
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,830
shoulder. You can get your head there,
too. You can't go out that way. Okay.

2638
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:11,840
too. You can't go out that way. Okay.
 

2639
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,709
too. You can't go out that way. Okay.
Now, you tricep pull. And we're still

2640
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:14,719
Now, you tricep pull. And we're still
 

2641
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,750
Now, you tricep pull. And we're still
testing the elbow. There's there's no

2642
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:17,760
testing the elbow. There's there's no
 

2643
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,149
testing the elbow. There's there's no
way he's going to get out of there and

2644
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:20,159
way he's going to get out of there and
 

2645
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:21,910
way he's going to get out of there and
no way he'll get out of there by the

2646
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:21,920
no way he'll get out of there by the
 

2647
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,709
no way he'll get out of there by the
time I touch that. Especially if I take

2648
01:38:24,709 --> 01:38:24,719
time I touch that. Especially if I take
 

2649
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,669
time I touch that. Especially if I take
his balance and he's falling. Okay. So,

2650
01:38:27,669 --> 01:38:27,679
his balance and he's falling. Okay. So,
 

2651
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:32,229
his balance and he's falling. Okay. So,
we just added to it. One, two, and then

2652
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
we just added to it. One, two, and then
 

2653
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,830
we just added to it. One, two, and then
we're still testing the elbow. It's

2654
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:33,840
we're still testing the elbow. It's
 

2655
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:46,629
we're still testing the elbow. It's
still loose. Okay. Try it.

2656
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:46,639

 

2657
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:49,830

Don't. Yeah. Give space. You want You

2658
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
Don't. Yeah. Give space. You want You
 

2659
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,910
Don't. Yeah. Give space. You want You
want this Virginia. This goes on the

2660
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:51,920
want this Virginia. This goes on the
 

2661
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,669
want this Virginia. This goes on the
throat. This goes on the Yes.

2662
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
throat. This goes on the Yes.
 

2663
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,430
throat. This goes on the Yes.
Now you just shrug your shoulder to keep

2664
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
Now you just shrug your shoulder to keep
 

2665
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,070
Now you just shrug your shoulder to keep
his head there and you tuck his head.

Good.
You're a little bit in the fleshy part.

2672
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400

 

2673
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,070

01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400

 

2679
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,669

It should be effortless.

2680
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
It should be effortless.
 

2681
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:29,030
It should be effortless.
You are got to get the bone against it.

2682
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
You are got to get the bone against it.
 

2683
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,990
You are got to get the bone against it.
Yeah. Don't Don't turn it.

2684
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:32,000
Yeah. Don't Don't turn it.
 

2685
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:43,910
Yeah. Don't Don't turn it.
Your elbow should not be down.

2686
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:43,920

 

2687
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,229

Okay, we're just testing the elbow.

2688
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:48,239
Okay, we're just testing the elbow.
 

2689
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,870
Okay, we're just testing the elbow.
Good. Tuck your shoulder. Tuck your

2692
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:52,480
head. Tuck your head so you can't
 

2693
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,709
head. Tuck your head so you can't

2695
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,830
squeeze it around.
There you go.

2696
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
There you go.
 

2697
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:04,870
There you go.
Okay, just once each part. Okay.

2698
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:04,880

 

2699
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,510

You cannot choke with your bicep. They

2700
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
You cannot choke with your bicep. They
 

2701
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,629
You cannot choke with your bicep. They
burn out. Okay. You don't you don't

2702
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:10,639
burn out. Okay. You don't you don't
 

2703
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:13,910
burn out. Okay. You don't you don't
choke by squeezing your your bicep back

2704
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:13,920
choke by squeezing your your bicep back
 

2705
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,590
choke by squeezing your your bicep back
into him. The choke that I did, he hung

2706
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
into him. The choke that I did, he hung
 

2707
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,149
into him. The choke that I did, he hung
himself. Okay. So, that's where the

2708
01:40:20,149 --> 01:40:20,159
himself. Okay. So, that's where the
 

2709
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:22,870
himself. Okay. So, that's where the
initial boom repression is on the on the

2710
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:22,880
initial boom repression is on the on the
 

2711
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,470
initial boom repression is on the on the
trachea. Does that make sense? Okay.

2712
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:26,480
trachea. Does that make sense? Okay.
 

2713
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,270
trachea. Does that make sense? Okay.
But to obey this rule that I'm not

2714
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:29,280
But to obey this rule that I'm not
 

2715
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,510
But to obey this rule that I'm not
pulling this in and I'm not lengthening

2716
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
pulling this in and I'm not lengthening
 

2717
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,030
pulling this in and I'm not lengthening
it. That takes weight too is I will feel

2718
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:35,040
it. That takes weight too is I will feel
 

2719
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,550
it. That takes weight too is I will feel
myself with that pond. Okay. So here's

2720
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,560
myself with that pond. Okay. So here's
 

2721
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,629
myself with that pond. Okay. So here's
that here's that pressure. I got it

2722
01:40:40,629 --> 01:40:40,639
that here's that pressure. I got it
 

2723
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:43,590
that here's that pressure. I got it
right on the edge. Right on the edge.

2724
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,600
right on the edge. Right on the edge.
 

2725
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,790
right on the edge. Right on the edge.
And I just start swelling. Take it off.

2726
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:46,800
And I just start swelling. Take it off.
 

2727
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,350
And I just start swelling. Take it off.
And you'll feel that without me moving

2728
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,360
And you'll feel that without me moving
 

2729
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,830
And you'll feel that without me moving
is tightening.

2730
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
is tightening.
 

2731
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,550
is tightening.
Okay. Does that make

2732
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
Okay. Does that make
 

2733
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,470
Okay. Does that make
Okay.

2734
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:56,480
Okay.
 

2735
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,229
Okay.
Right. Because the pressure falls and

2736
01:40:58,229 --> 01:40:58,239
Right. Because the pressure falls and
 

2737
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,790
Right. Because the pressure falls and
the tandem swells. So that tandem is now

2738
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
the tandem swells. So that tandem is now
 

2739
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,270
the tandem swells. So that tandem is now
pushing on on him. Okay. Um and so I

2740
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
pushing on on him. Okay. Um and so I
 

2741
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,030
pushing on on him. Okay. Um and so I
don't ever burn the the choke out. So

2742
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,040
don't ever burn the the choke out. So
 

2743
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:11,590
don't ever burn the the choke out. So
again to do this

2744
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:11,600

 

2745
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,149

I get everything in place. Everything's

2746
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:14,159
I get everything in place. Everything's
 

2747
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:18,629
I get everything in place. Everything's
in place. Okay. I don't use my bicep. I

2748
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
in place. Okay. I don't use my bicep. I
 

2749
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,950
in place. Okay. I don't use my bicep. I
start to release.

2750
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:22,960

 

2751
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,390

Okay. He'll feel it pressing and he

2752
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:26,400
Okay. He'll feel it pressing and he
 

2753
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,430
Okay. He'll feel it pressing and he
that's where he safely should

2754
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:29,440
that's where he safely should
 

2755
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,750
that's where he safely should
do it. Tap out, okay? Because we don't

2756
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:31,760
do it. Tap out, okay? Because we don't
 

2757
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,990
do it. Tap out, okay? Because we don't
want to damage each other. But you

2758
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:34,000
want to damage each other. But you
 

2759
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,830
want to damage each other. But you
should feel a pressure change on your

2760
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:35,840
should feel a pressure change on your
 

2761
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:47,510
should feel a pressure change on your
throat from the pressure change. Okay?

2762
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520

 

2763
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,109

Release the tension.

2788
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:43,280

 

2789
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,070

Okay.

2790
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,080
Okay.

Okay.

2794
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:56,560

 

2795
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,510

So for example

2796
01:42:59,510 --> 01:42:59,520
So for example
 

2797
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,870
So for example
um

2798
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880

 

2799
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,910

again go back a lot of us don't think is

2800
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:05,920
again go back a lot of us don't think is
 

2801
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:13,510
again go back a lot of us don't think is
legal now we see aggressive um

2802
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,520

 

2803
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,870

but this would be one of those things

2804
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:14,880
but this would be one of those things
 

2805
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,550
but this would be one of those things
like from a peace officer use force law

2806
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:18,560
like from a peace officer use force law
 

2807
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,709
like from a peace officer use force law
if I could dump him on his

2808
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:20,719
if I could dump him on his
 

2809
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,870
if I could dump him on his
not reacting to shock him. If I could

2810
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:22,880
not reacting to shock him. If I could
 

2811
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,990
not reacting to shock him. If I could
shot him, I could break his trade. All

2812
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
shot him, I could break his trade. All
 

2813
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,590
shot him, I could break his trade. All
all those things at the same level of

2814
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:27,600
all those things at the same level of
 

2815
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:35,990
all those things at the same level of
course is all serious bod injury/

2816
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000

 

2817
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,950

second point you can see I can take this

2818
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:38,960
second point you can see I can take this
 

2819
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,870
second point you can see I can take this
force engineer and do something totally

2820
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:40,880
force engineer and do something totally
 

2821
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:47,109
force engineer and do something totally
freaking different, right? Um

2822
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119

 

2823
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:50,950

which is why it's import that I'm in

2824
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:50,960
which is why it's import that I'm in
 

2825
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,030
which is why it's import that I'm in
certain areas

2826
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,040
certain areas
 

2827
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,709
certain areas
in certain ways. So, we talked about how

2828
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:54,719
in certain ways. So, we talked about how
 

2829
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,310
in certain ways. So, we talked about how
important being in the right place at

2830
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
important being in the right place at
 

2831
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:02,070
important being in the right place at
the right time. Okay.

2832
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:02,080

 

2833
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,830

If ad

2834
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:03,840
If ad
 

2835
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,149
If ad
for whatever reason

2836
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:06,159
for whatever reason
 

2837
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:08,470
for whatever reason
goes south,

2838
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,480
goes south,
 

2839
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,030
goes south,
you're in the back.

2840
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,040
you're in the back.
 

2841
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,270
you're in the back.
A lot better options are back there than

2842
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:13,280
A lot better options are back there than
 

2843
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,070
A lot better options are back there than
trying to find this thing that you're

2844
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:16,080
trying to find this thing that you're
 

2845
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,470
trying to find this thing that you're
losing. You should you lost it. you

2846
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480
losing. You should you lost it. you
 

2847
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,030
losing. You should you lost it. you
should go to the next technique. Okay?

2848
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:21,040
should go to the next technique. Okay?
 

2849
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,030
should go to the next technique. Okay?
And the transition should be so

2850
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
And the transition should be so
 

2851
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,070
And the transition should be so
seamlessly that no one would ever know

2852
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:26,080
seamlessly that no one would ever know
 

2853
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,750
seamlessly that no one would ever know
watching that you had in mind. Okay?

2854
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:29,760
watching that you had in mind. Okay?
 

2855
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,310
watching that you had in mind. Okay?
That's how seamless. So in order to be

2856
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,320
That's how seamless. So in order to be
 

2857
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,350
That's how seamless. So in order to be
that seamless in our fluidity,

2858
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
that seamless in our fluidity,
 

2859
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,030
that seamless in our fluidity,
our body itself has to be as neutral as

2860
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:39,040
our body itself has to be as neutral as
 

2861
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:43,030
our body itself has to be as neutral as
possible until initiative is achieved.

2862
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:43,040
possible until initiative is achieved.
 

2863
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,669
possible until initiative is achieved.
Okay? So, in other words, if I get

2864
01:44:45,669 --> 01:44:45,679
Okay? So, in other words, if I get
 

2865
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,390
Okay? So, in other words, if I get
behind you and I start to rotate you, I

2866
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,400
behind you and I start to rotate you, I
 

2867
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,629
behind you and I start to rotate you, I
I got you not here, right? In other

2868
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:50,639
I got you not here, right? In other
 

2869
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,030
I got you not here, right? In other
words, but if for whatever reason, I

2870
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040
words, but if for whatever reason, I
 

2871
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,629
words, but if for whatever reason, I
don't know, you changed your height, you

2872
01:44:54,629 --> 01:44:54,639
don't know, you changed your height, you
 

2873
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:56,950
don't know, you changed your height, you
see, because your when you felt your

2874
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:56,960
see, because your when you felt your
 

2875
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,709
see, because your when you felt your
center getting tipped this way, remember

2876
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:58,719
center getting tipped this way, remember
 

2877
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:01,109
center getting tipped this way, remember
that originally turned your your angle

2878
01:45:01,109 --> 01:45:01,119
that originally turned your your angle
 

2879
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,030
that originally turned your your angle
like that and you you dropped your

dropped your weight. I merged with that

2884
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
dropped your weight. I merged with that
 

2885
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,510
dropped your weight. I merged with that
energy. Boom. Send your center out.

This is why for example I was saying

2894
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
This is why for example I was saying
 

2895
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:25,109
This is why for example I was saying
don't don't get to the back in on me.

01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,709
You That's where you want to be. And
it's totally different from being

2926
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:10,719
it's totally different from being
 

2927
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,950
it's totally different from being
slightly off to the side. Okay. Um, so

2928
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:14,960
slightly off to the side. Okay. Um, so
 

2929
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,830
slightly off to the side. Okay. Um, so
here we have this technique that only

2930
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
here we have this technique that only
 

2931
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,669
here we have this technique that only
will function from straight on the back.

2932
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:19,679
will function from straight on the back.
 

2933
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,030
will function from straight on the back.
Won't function from straight off the

2934
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,040
Won't function from straight off the
 

2935
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,030
Won't function from straight off the
side.

2936
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,040
side.
 

2937
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:27,030
side.
All right. Um, questions, comments,

2938
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,040
All right. Um, questions, comments,
 

2939
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,550
All right. Um, questions, comments,
observations.

2940
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:28,560
observations.
 

2941
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,669
observations.
Um, the very last choke there was no

2942
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:31,679
Um, the very last choke there was no
 

2943
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,910
Um, the very last choke there was no
mechanical in your arm and I don't know

2944
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:35,920
mechanical in your arm and I don't know
 

2945
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,830
mechanical in your arm and I don't know
what it was, but

2946
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
what it was, but
 

2947
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,629
what it was, but
It's like some something swelled up.

2948
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:40,639
It's like some something swelled up.
 

2949
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,229
It's like some something swelled up.
Yeah. In the back of me or in front of

2950
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:42,239
Yeah. In the back of me or in front of
 

2951
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:45,830
Yeah. In the back of me or in front of
me or both and I just kind of got like I

2952
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:45,840
me or both and I just kind of got like I
 

2953
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:51,189
me or both and I just kind of got like I
said there was no Yeah. It was just

2954
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:51,199
said there was no Yeah. It was just
 

2955
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,430
said there was no Yeah. It was just
cuz that does that happen. You've seen

2956
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:53,440
cuz that does that happen. You've seen
 

2957
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,310
cuz that does that happen. You've seen
me do it in another way where like I had

2958
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:56,320
me do it in another way where like I had
 

2959
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,950
me do it in another way where like I had
Why did you punch punch at me from that

2960
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:58,960
Why did you punch punch at me from that
 

2961
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,870
Why did you punch punch at me from that
swollen position, right? Or ski at me,

2962
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
swollen position, right? Or ski at me,
 

2963
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,750
swollen position, right? Or ski at me,
right? doesn't mean I'm going to let you

2964
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:05,760
right? doesn't mean I'm going to let you
 

2965
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,990
right? doesn't mean I'm going to let you
ever punch me or that's my defense, but

2966
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,000
ever punch me or that's my defense, but
 

2967
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,990
ever punch me or that's my defense, but
it's a way of confirming that it's

2968
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:10,000
it's a way of confirming that it's
 

2969
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,149
it's a way of confirming that it's
there. Here it's put to a use um to help

2970
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:14,159
there. Here it's put to a use um to help
 

2971
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:18,149
there. Here it's put to a use um to help
you know constrict things um when you

2972
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
you know constrict things um when you
 

2973
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:20,070
you know constrict things um when you
start flexing

2974
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
start flexing
 

2975
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,070
start flexing
a lot of times you're getting smaller,

2976
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,080
a lot of times you're getting smaller,
 

2977
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,790
a lot of times you're getting smaller,
you see, until the pressure now now you

2978
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
you see, until the pressure now now you
 

2979
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,629
you see, until the pressure now now you
start to set that pressure up. Um

2980
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:28,639
start to set that pressure up. Um
 

2981
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:31,030
start to set that pressure up. Um
but in that meantime, those muscles that

2982
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,040
but in that meantime, those muscles that
 

2983
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,669
but in that meantime, those muscles that
are not necessary and aren't even in the

2984
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:33,679
are not necessary and aren't even in the
 

2985
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,310
are not necessary and aren't even in the
choke. They're fatiguing out. So, you

2986
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
choke. They're fatiguing out. So, you
 

2987
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,070
choke. They're fatiguing out. So, you
enter into the fatigue cycles really

2988
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080
enter into the fatigue cycles really
 

2989
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,229
enter into the fatigue cycles really
quickly. What we teach

2990
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,239
quickly. What we teach
 

2991
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:47,109
quickly. What we teach
in in law enforcement is um like I don't

2992
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:47,119
in in law enforcement is um like I don't
 

2993
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,510
in in law enforcement is um like I don't
know. So, let me let me fill you in. So,

2994
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:49,520
know. So, let me let me fill you in. So,
 

2995
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,790
know. So, let me let me fill you in. So,
in um BJA they'll talk I don't even know

2996
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
in um BJA they'll talk I don't even know
 

2997
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,149
in um BJA they'll talk I don't even know
what they call it. I don't know if that

2998
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,159
what they call it. I don't know if that
 

2999
01:47:54,159 --> 01:48:01,510
what they call it. I don't know if that
was a law enforcement nucleus.

3000
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:01,520

 

3001
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,910

But I know that I've heard like Henry

3002
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:03,920
But I know that I've heard like Henry
 

3003
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,590
But I know that I've heard like Henry
and Grayson talk about this. You get

3004
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:05,600
and Grayson talk about this. You get
 

3005
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,430
and Grayson talk about this. You get
them tired. They start to get tired. And

3006
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,440
them tired. They start to get tired. And
 

3007
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,229
them tired. They start to get tired. And
in BJJ that conventional wisdom, it's

3008
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:10,239
in BJJ that conventional wisdom, it's
 

3009
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:13,590
in BJJ that conventional wisdom, it's
like a minute. People kind of fight hard

3010
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
like a minute. People kind of fight hard
 

3011
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,669
like a minute. People kind of fight hard
for a minute. Um, and what we have found

3012
01:48:17,669 --> 01:48:17,679
for a minute. Um, and what we have found
 

3013
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:21,030
for a minute. Um, and what we have found
on the street is probably because we're

3014
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:21,040
on the street is probably because we're
 

3015
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,189
on the street is probably because we're
not really dealing with highly trained

3016
01:48:23,189 --> 01:48:23,199
not really dealing with highly trained
 

3017
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:26,229
not really dealing with highly trained
people or if we are dealing with highly

3018
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
people or if we are dealing with highly
 

3019
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,070
people or if we are dealing with highly
trained people,

3020
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
trained people,
 

3021
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,270
trained people,
they're also high or drawn things like

3022
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:31,280
they're also high or drawn things like
 

3023
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,590
they're also high or drawn things like
this. So, they're not at their physical

3024
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:33,600
this. So, they're not at their physical
 

3025
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,270
this. So, they're not at their physical
peak. So, the fatigue cycle is actually

3026
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:37,280
peak. So, the fatigue cycle is actually
 

3027
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,709
peak. So, the fatigue cycle is actually
about 10 to 15 seconds that dude peters

3028
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
about 10 to 15 seconds that dude peters
 

3029
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,109
about 10 to 15 seconds that dude peters
out. Okay. Well, the same thing goes for

3030
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:43,119
out. Okay. Well, the same thing goes for
 

3031
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:45,910
out. Okay. Well, the same thing goes for
you. in those high adrenaline fights

3032
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:45,920
you. in those high adrenaline fights
 

3033
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:47,990
you. in those high adrenaline fights
like you you will peter out really fast

3034
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
like you you will peter out really fast
 

3035
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,990
like you you will peter out really fast
if you're doing maximum effort on

3036
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,000
if you're doing maximum effort on
 

3037
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,790
if you're doing maximum effort on
anything. Um

3038
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:52,800
anything. Um
 

3039
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,109
anything. Um
that kind of goes into like even foot

3040
01:48:55,109 --> 01:48:55,119
that kind of goes into like even foot
 

3041
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:57,430
that kind of goes into like even foot
pursuit. So like in the movie in the

3042
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:57,440
pursuit. So like in the movie in the
 

3043
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,750
pursuit. So like in the movie in the
movies you see the cops running

3044
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
movies you see the cops running
 

3045
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,470
movies you see the cops running
everyone's running and we don't do that

3046
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
everyone's running and we don't do that
 

3047
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,790
everyone's running and we don't do that
because when you catch that guy you're

3048
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:04,800
because when you catch that guy you're
 

3049
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,270
because when you catch that guy you're
going to have to fight. So we do more

3050
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:07,280
going to have to fight. So we do more
 

3051
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,350
going to have to fight. So we do more
like I think it's called persistence

3052
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,360
like I think it's called persistence
 

3053
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,990
like I think it's called persistence
hunting country. You just kind of keep

3054
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
hunting country. You just kind of keep
 

3055
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,030
hunting country. You just kind of keep
eyes on it. That guy peters out because

3056
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:15,040
eyes on it. That guy peters out because
 

3057
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,270
eyes on it. That guy peters out because
he's high on meth or whatever. And then

3058
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,280
he's high on meth or whatever. And then
 

3059
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,709
he's high on meth or whatever. And then
I'll wrestle with the guy that already

3060
01:49:18,709 --> 01:49:18,719
I'll wrestle with the guy that already
 

3061
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,629
I'll wrestle with the guy that already
put himself in the fatigue cycle kind of

3062
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
put himself in the fatigue cycle kind of
 

3063
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,510
put himself in the fatigue cycle kind of
thing. But it takes uh emotional

3064
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:23,520
thing. But it takes uh emotional
 

3065
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,990
thing. But it takes uh emotional
intelligence, spiritual maturity to not

3066
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:26,000
intelligence, spiritual maturity to not
 

3067
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,990
intelligence, spiritual maturity to not
get angsted up and start flexing

3068
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:28,000
get angsted up and start flexing
 

3069
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,109
get angsted up and start flexing
unnecessarily.

3070
01:49:31,109 --> 01:49:31,119

 

3071
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,229

So um the way to not do it is with the

3072
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
So um the way to not do it is with the
 

3073
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:36,149
So um the way to not do it is with the
sound techn

3074
01:49:36,149 --> 01:49:36,159
sound techn
 

3075
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:37,990
sound techn
invented that. This is what this is the

3076
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:38,000
invented that. This is what this is the
 

3077
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,550
invented that. This is what this is the
way they always do it. So, if you go

3078
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:40,560
way they always do it. So, if you go
 

3079
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,629

see that and the dude is choked out and
 

3089
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,229
see that and the dude is choked out and
sometimes you don't even see the choke.

3090
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:54,239
sometimes you don't even see the choke.
 

3091
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:55,990
sometimes you don't even see the choke.
Uh, and part of that is that you don't

3092
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,000
Uh, and part of that is that you don't
 

3093
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,310
Uh, and part of that is that you don't
see the naga actually doing any of the

3094
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:58,320
see the naga actually doing any of the
 

3095
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,109
see the naga actually doing any of the
squeezing or anything. Um, or you might

3096
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:01,119
squeezing or anything. Um, or you might
 

3097
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,189
squeezing or anything. Um, or you might
have seen fights where the guy lets go

3098
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
have seen fights where the guy lets go
 

3099
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:05,109
have seen fights where the guy lets go
at him and the ref is wondering what

3100
01:50:05,109 --> 01:50:05,119
at him and the ref is wondering what
 

3101
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:07,910
at him and the ref is wondering what
happened and then he's out, right? You

3102
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:07,920
happened and then he's out, right? You
 

3103
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,510
happened and then he's out, right? You
see all that kind of and that's just

3104
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:09,520
see all that kind of and that's just
 

3105
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,830
see all that kind of and that's just
proper technique. It's not magic. It's

3106
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:11,840
proper technique. It's not magic. It's
 

3107
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,390
proper technique. It's not magic. It's
just improper technique has become

3108
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:14,400
just improper technique has become
 

3109
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,430
just improper technique has become
common place now.

3110
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
common place now.
 

3111
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,470
common place now.
It's not

3112
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:20,480
It's not
 

3113
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,790
It's not
um

3114
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
um
 

3115
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,669
um
just like that that the coy projection

3116
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:25,679
just like that that the coy projection
 

3117
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:27,430
just like that that the coy projection
of their of their center out into the

3118
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,440
of their of their center out into the
 

3119
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,830
of their of their center out into the
hanging. It's not it's the same exact

3120
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:29,840
hanging. It's not it's the same exact
 

3121
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,990
hanging. It's not it's the same exact
thing

3122
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:32,000
thing
 

3123
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,990
thing
but it's more complicated because the

3124
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:34,000
but it's more complicated because the
 

3125
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,830
but it's more complicated because the
angle is more different and I'm busy

3126
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:35,840
angle is more different and I'm busy
 

3127
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,910
angle is more different and I'm busy
doing opposed to just that simple thing.

3128
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:39,920
doing opposed to just that simple thing.
 

3129
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,390
doing opposed to just that simple thing.
As far as the pulse goes, it's exactly

3130
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
As far as the pulse goes, it's exactly
 

3131
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,560
As far as the pulse goes, it's exactly
the same.
