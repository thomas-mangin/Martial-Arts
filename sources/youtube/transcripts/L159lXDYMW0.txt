This is the person from Imayama. There
is no YouTube at all. The white area is Senyama Labor, the
blue area is Iwate Prefectural
Highway, so the red is Hiroshima Prefecture. They have
n't
done anything. The yellow area is Tokyo, Kanagawa Prefectural Highway, Okawahara Muro, and the green area is Chiba Prefecture, Aichi Prefectural Highway. So it can't be controlled. Why do you go like this? What do you
think?
So I'm saying that even if this technique becomes law,
can you do it? And
that's all. It
varies from country to country, so it
might turn into a battle. That can't be helped,
so it will flow. Kotori
