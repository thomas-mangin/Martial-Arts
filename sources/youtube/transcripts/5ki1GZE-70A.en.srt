8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
don't want all this other
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,709
don't want all this other
added things but i mean i realized that

10
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
added things but i mean i realized that
 

11
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,790
added things but i mean i realized that
without the added things you don't

12
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
without the added things you don't
 

13
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,510
without the added things you don't
actually find either

14
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
actually find either
 

15
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,950
actually find either
so you're actually rushing to get into a

16
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
so you're actually rushing to get into a
 

17
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,630
so you're actually rushing to get into a
tunnel

18
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
tunnel
 

19
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,070
tunnel
because you think the tunnel has the

20
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
because you think the tunnel has the
 

21
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,870
because you think the tunnel has the
answer the problem is you don't know how

22
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
answer the problem is you don't know how
 

23
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,870
answer the problem is you don't know how
long the tunnel is because most tunnels

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
long the tunnel is because most tunnels
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,110
long the tunnel is because most tunnels
are dark

26
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
are dark
 

27
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,389
are dark
so i

28
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
so i
 

29
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,750
so i
i didn't listen basically to people

30
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
i didn't listen basically to people
 

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,950
