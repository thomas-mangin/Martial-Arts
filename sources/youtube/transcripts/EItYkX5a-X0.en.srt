if you have any difficulties with
sitting up

76
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360

 

77
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,350

it can be because your feet are too

78
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
it can be because your feet are too
 

79
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,310
it can be because your feet are too
close so make sure that when you roll

80
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320

 

81
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,749

you're stretching your foot in the

83
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,229
you're stretching your foot in the
direction that you are moving

84
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
direction that you are moving
 

85
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,270
direction that you are moving
so it's gonna be easier to kneel up

86
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
so it's gonna be easier to kneel up
 

87
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,869
so it's gonna be easier to kneel up
and later to stand up okay next step

88
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
and later to stand up okay next step
 

89
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,750
and later to stand up okay next step

and to the side

102
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200

 

103
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,509

in actual practice we usually start the

104
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
in actual practice we usually start the
 

105
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,190
in actual practice we usually start the
ukami from the front leg

106
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
ukami from the front leg
 

107
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,670
ukami from the front leg
which is closer to the partner so it's

108
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
which is closer to the partner so it's
 

109
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,670
which is closer to the partner so it's
good to practice this ukami like this

110
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680

 

111
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,710

step back kneel

112
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720

 

113
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,430

and after you stand up you have to turn

114
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
and after you stand up you have to turn
 

115
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,830
and after you stand up you have to turn
backwards where your partner

116
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
backwards where your partner
 

117
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,149
backwards where your partner
actually is other side

118
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159

 

119
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,830

you can stand up just like before and

120
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840

 

121
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,949

pivot

122
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959

 

123
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,470

and pivot or another way that i

124
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
and pivot or another way that i
 

125
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,390
and pivot or another way that i
personally prefer to do

126
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400

 

127
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,949

is something like this i put my toes

128
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
is something like this i put my toes
 

129
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,910
is something like this i put my toes
close together

130
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
close together
 

131
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,309
close together
i'm in this toe crunch position so it's

132
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
i'm in this toe crunch position so it's
 

133
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,110
i'm in this toe crunch position so it's
easier

134
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
easier
 

135
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,470
easier
faster to turn so you can reduce the

136
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
faster to turn so you can reduce the
 

137
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,589
faster to turn so you can reduce the
time

138
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
time
 

139
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,589
time
when you are showing your back to your

140
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
when you are showing your back to your
 

141
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,949
when you are showing your back to your
partner

142
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
partner
 

143
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,789
partner
and turn instantly and stand up

144
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
and turn instantly and stand up
 

145
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,270
and turn instantly and stand up
as a more advanced exercise it's good to

146
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
as a more advanced exercise it's good to
 

147
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,869
as a more advanced exercise it's good to
practice that your body is actually

148
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
practice that your body is actually
 

149
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,229
practice that your body is actually
falling backwards

150
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
falling backwards
 

151
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,270
falling backwards
so the ukemi is going to look like this

152
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
so the ukemi is going to look like this
 

153
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,149
so the ukemi is going to look like this
i'm standing naturally stretching back

154
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
i'm standing naturally stretching back
 

155
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,710
i'm standing naturally stretching back
first

156
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
first
 

157
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,110
first
and try to get the feeling that my i'm

158
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
and try to get the feeling that my i'm
 

159
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,710
and try to get the feeling that my i'm
unbalanced and i'm actually falling

160
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
unbalanced and i'm actually falling
 

161
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,789
unbalanced and i'm actually falling
backwards

162
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
backwards
 

163
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,270
backwards
and start looking from there

164
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280

 

165
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:09,670

yeah stretching

166
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680

 

167
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,750

something like this let's take a look at

168
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
something like this let's take a look at
 

169
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,789
something like this let's take a look at
some applications

170
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
some applications
 

171
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,670
some applications
first from category sumitoshi previously

172
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
first from category sumitoshi previously
 

173
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,590
first from category sumitoshi previously
we learned ushirokamin

174
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
we learned ushirokamin
 

175
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,870
we learned ushirokamin
which was like this

176
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880

 

177
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,150

so when you stand up here the distance

178
