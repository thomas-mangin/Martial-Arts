00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,629

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:02,639
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,789
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk about the Kaishiwaza

4
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
going to talk about the Kaishiwaza
 

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,190
going to talk about the Kaishiwaza
practice that we do at my school. Um, so

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
practice that we do at my school. Um, so
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,030
practice that we do at my school. Um, so
kaishi just means turnover. So

8
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,040
kaishi just means turnover. So
 

9
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,790
kaishi just means turnover. So
kaiishiwaza means turnover practice.

10
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
kaiishiwaza means turnover practice.
 

11
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,470
kaiishiwaza means turnover practice.
That's where you're turning over the

12
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
That's where you're turning over the
 

13
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,910
That's where you're turning over the
techniques. One person's doing it and

14
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
techniques. One person's doing it and
 

15
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,190
techniques. One person's doing it and
then the other person's doing it and

16
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
then the other person's doing it and
 

17
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,029
then the other person's doing it and
then the other person's doing it. Uh,

18
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
then the other person's doing it. Uh,
 

19
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,550
then the other person's doing it. Uh,
whatever it is, the technique, right?

20
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
whatever it is, the technique, right?
 

21
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,830
whatever it is, the technique, right?
Doing the technique to that person. So

22
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
Doing the technique to that person. So
 

23
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,070
Doing the technique to that person. So
we do it with a knife. Um, it's a real

24
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
we do it with a knife. Um, it's a real
 

25
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,029
we do it with a knife. Um, it's a real
cool practice. If you want to see the

26
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
cool practice. If you want to see the
 

27
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,670
cool practice. If you want to see the
techniques appear a lot, this practice

28
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
techniques appear a lot, this practice
 

29
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,150
techniques appear a lot, this practice
will pretty much guaranteed help you see

30
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
will pretty much guaranteed help you see
 

31
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,990
will pretty much guaranteed help you see
the techniques a lot. It's a pretty

32
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
the techniques a lot. It's a pretty
 

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,830
the techniques a lot. It's a pretty
low-level practice. It's pretty chill.

34
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
low-level practice. It's pretty chill.
 

35
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,229
low-level practice. It's pretty chill.
Like, so it's it's fun to move around. I

36
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
Like, so it's it's fun to move around. I
 

37
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,229
Like, so it's it's fun to move around. I
compare it to easy rolling in Brazilian

38
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
compare it to easy rolling in Brazilian
 

39
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,430
compare it to easy rolling in Brazilian
jiu-jitsu. So, if you've ever done

40
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
jiu-jitsu. So, if you've ever done
 

41
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,790
jiu-jitsu. So, if you've ever done
Brazilian jiu-jitsu and someone just

42
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
Brazilian jiu-jitsu and someone just
 

43
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,150
Brazilian jiu-jitsu and someone just
says, "Hey, let's roll." Meaning like,

44
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
says, "Hey, let's roll." Meaning like,
 

45
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,069
says, "Hey, let's roll." Meaning like,
"Let's just mess around a little. We're

46
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
"Let's just mess around a little. We're
 

47
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,190
"Let's just mess around a little. We're
not going to go too crazy on each

48
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
not going to go too crazy on each
 

49
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,630
not going to go too crazy on each
other." Then that's what this kind of

50
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
other." Then that's what this kind of
 

51
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,350
other." Then that's what this kind of
practice is for iikido. Um, in lots of

52
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
practice is for iikido. Um, in lots of
 

53
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,950
practice is for iikido. Um, in lots of
ways it it really lends itself more

54
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
ways it it really lends itself more
 

55
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,790
ways it it really lends itself more
towards armed grappling than iikido

56
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
towards armed grappling than iikido
 

57
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,029
towards armed grappling than iikido
specifically, but it's a good tool to

58
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
specifically, but it's a good tool to
 

59
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,110
specifically, but it's a good tool to
see how the techniques come off. So, I'm

60
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
see how the techniques come off. So, I'm
 

61
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,069
see how the techniques come off. So, I'm
going to call Josh over here. We're

62
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
going to call Josh over here. We're
 

63
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,910
going to call Josh over here. We're
going to go to work.

64
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:00,920

 

65
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,789

Josh. All right. So, let's talk about

66
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:03,799
Josh. All right. So, let's talk about
 

67
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,990
Josh. All right. So, let's talk about
kaishiwaza as we practice it here in the

68
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
kaishiwaza as we practice it here in the
 

69
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,390
kaishiwaza as we practice it here in the
dojo. So, the kaishiwaza practice we

70
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
dojo. So, the kaishiwaza practice we
 

71
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,750
dojo. So, the kaishiwaza practice we
have is different than maybe you would

72
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
have is different than maybe you would
 

73
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,109
have is different than maybe you would
see in other schools. In other schools,

74
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
see in other schools. In other schools,
 

75
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,789
see in other schools. In other schools,
kaiishiwaza when they say kaiuaza,

76
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
kaiishiwaza when they say kaiuaza,
 

77
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,630
kaiishiwaza when they say kaiuaza,
they're usually talking about a set of

78
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
they're usually talking about a set of
 

79
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,710
they're usually talking about a set of
techniques that turn over, right? So

80
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
techniques that turn over, right? So
 

81
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,710
techniques that turn over, right? So
like for example, you know, if Josh

82
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
like for example, you know, if Josh
 

83
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,590
like for example, you know, if Josh
started to do eekyo to me, right? Then I

84
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
started to do eekyo to me, right? Then I
 

85
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,590
started to do eekyo to me, right? Then I
could step out, do eekyo to him, and

86
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
could step out, do eekyo to him, and
 

87
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,749
could step out, do eekyo to him, and
that would be kaiishi. And that's the

88
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
that would be kaiishi. And that's the
 

89
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,149
that would be kaiishi. And that's the
same usage of the word we're using. It's

90
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
same usage of the word we're using. It's
 

91
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,590
same usage of the word we're using. It's
just the practice doesn't look like

92
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
just the practice doesn't look like
 

93
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,670
just the practice doesn't look like
that. The practice starts really simply.

94
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
that. The practice starts really simply.
 

95
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,670
that. The practice starts really simply.
One person has the knife and the other

96
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
One person has the knife and the other
 

97
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,069
One person has the knife and the other
person gets to start with a katori grip,

98
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
person gets to start with a katori grip,
 

99
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,910
person gets to start with a katori grip,
right? So we start in this configuration

100
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
right? So we start in this configuration
 

101
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,630
right? So we start in this configuration
and then from here the objective of the

102
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
and then from here the objective of the
 

103
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,190
and then from here the objective of the
person with the knife is to get free and

104
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
person with the knife is to get free and
 

105
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,670
person with the knife is to get free and
use the knife and and you know use the

106
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
use the knife and and you know use the
 

107
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,350
use the knife and and you know use the
knives loose because this is not a

108
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
knives loose because this is not a
 

109
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,630
knives loose because this is not a
cutting practice right so if the

110
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
cutting practice right so if the
 

111
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,149
cutting practice right so if the
practice just looked like this that

112
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
practice just looked like this that
 

113
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,149
practice just looked like this that
would be a crummy practice because we

114
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
would be a crummy practice because we
 

115
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,830
would be a crummy practice because we
would just be practicing my stabbing

116
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
would just be practicing my stabbing
 

117
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,190
would just be practicing my stabbing
skills and Josh would be practicing his

118
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
skills and Josh would be practicing his
 

119
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,870
skills and Josh would be practicing his
not getting stab skills but the

120
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
not getting stab skills but the
 

121
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,230
not getting stab skills but the
objective of this is to actually

122
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
objective of this is to actually
 

123
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,389
objective of this is to actually
practice the technique. So, if I get

124
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
practice the technique. So, if I get
 

125
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,469
practice the technique. So, if I get
free, sure, I'll go to stab Josh, but

126
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
free, sure, I'll go to stab Josh, but
 

127
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,389
free, sure, I'll go to stab Josh, but
it's going to be real slow and chill so

128
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
it's going to be real slow and chill so
 

129
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,590
it's going to be real slow and chill so
he can actually get it back under

130
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
he can actually get it back under
 

131
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,789
he can actually get it back under
control and then he can start to work

132
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
control and then he can start to work
 

133
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,070
control and then he can start to work
it. Now, also on his side, his objective

134
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
it. Now, also on his side, his objective
 

135
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,630
it. Now, also on his side, his objective
is to try to get the knife away from me

136
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
is to try to get the knife away from me
 

137
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,630
is to try to get the knife away from me
so he then has the knife and that's the

138
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
so he then has the knife and that's the
 

139
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,470
so he then has the knife and that's the
kaishi, right? So, like it's switching

140
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
kaishi, right? So, like it's switching
 

141
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,910
kaishi, right? So, like it's switching
over. He's taking the knife so then he

142
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
over. He's taking the knife so then he
 

143
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,110
over. He's taking the knife so then he
could use the knife on me and I'm taking

144
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
could use the knife on me and I'm taking
 

145
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,710
could use the knife on me and I'm taking
the knife so I can use it on him. Now,

146
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
the knife so I can use it on him. Now,
 

147
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,990
the knife so I can use it on him. Now,
when you start this, you guys are going

148
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
when you start this, you guys are going
 

149
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,270
when you start this, you guys are going
to do it really terribly, almost

150
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
to do it really terribly, almost
 

151
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,030
to do it really terribly, almost
guaranteed because, and I I don't mean

152
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
guaranteed because, and I I don't mean
 

153
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,150
guaranteed because, and I I don't mean
like that your performance of the

154
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
like that your performance of the
 

155
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,270
like that your performance of the
techniques is going to be bad. What I

156
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
techniques is going to be bad. What I
 

157
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,869
techniques is going to be bad. What I
mean is you're going to do it really

158
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
mean is you're going to do it really
 

159
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,949
mean is you're going to do it really
hard and crazy and there's a place for

160
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
hard and crazy and there's a place for
 

161
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,710
hard and crazy and there's a place for
that but that place is really rondor and

162
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
that but that place is really rondor and
 

163
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,990
that but that place is really rondor and
that's not the place for this kind of

164
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
that's not the place for this kind of
 

165
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,070
that's not the place for this kind of
drill. So it should start out real slow

166
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
drill. So it should start out real slow
 

167
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,430
drill. So it should start out real slow
and Josh and I hopefully will start out

168
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
and Josh and I hopefully will start out
 

169
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,790
and Josh and I hopefully will start out
really really slow for you and we'll

170
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
really really slow for you and we'll
 

171
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,710
really really slow for you and we'll
kind of build a little bit but so you

172
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
kind of build a little bit but so you
 

173
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,229
kind of build a little bit but so you
know I begin trying to do something like

174
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
know I begin trying to do something like
 

175
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,309
know I begin trying to do something like
that. Oh, and I switch and I come around

176
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
that. Oh, and I switch and I come around
 

177
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,229
that. Oh, and I switch and I come around
here like this and I'm trying to get

178
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
here like this and I'm trying to get
 

179
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,150
here like this and I'm trying to get
free and then Josh is getting it and

180
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
free and then Josh is getting it and
 

181
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,430
free and then Josh is getting it and
he's working now. He's got the knife.

182
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
he's working now. He's got the knife.
 

183
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,190
he's working now. He's got the knife.
Okay. And Josh is coming in at me and

184
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
Okay. And Josh is coming in at me and
 

185
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,030
Okay. And Josh is coming in at me and
I'm working. Oh, and I got it and I come

186
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm working. Oh, and I got it and I come
 

187
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,790
I'm working. Oh, and I got it and I come
back over and he's setting up a

188
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
back over and he's setting up a
 

189
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,550
back over and he's setting up a
technique. Boom. Boom. Boom. Okay. Okay.

190
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
technique. Boom. Boom. Boom. Okay. Okay.
 

191
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,830
technique. Boom. Boom. Boom. Okay. Okay.
And right now we're going ultra ultra

192
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
And right now we're going ultra ultra
 

193
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,350
And right now we're going ultra ultra
light and we're not we're not resisting

194
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
light and we're not we're not resisting
 

195
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,869
light and we're not we're not resisting
each other at all. We're just kind of

196
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
each other at all. We're just kind of
 

197
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,229
each other at all. We're just kind of
working the knife. Okay. And that's kind

198
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
working the knife. Okay. And that's kind
 

199
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,149
working the knife. Okay. And that's kind
of where you should start. You could

200
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
of where you should start. You could
 

201
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,670
of where you should start. You could
start this from lots of ways, but just

202
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
start this from lots of ways, but just
 

203
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,509
start this from lots of ways, but just
kind of basically so like you know I

204
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
kind of basically so like you know I
 

205
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,030
kind of basically so like you know I
almost give him something, you know? So

206
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
almost give him something, you know? So
 

207
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,790
almost give him something, you know? So
like, oh, he's got that niko and I'm not

208
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
like, oh, he's got that niko and I'm not
 

209
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,070
like, oh, he's got that niko and I'm not
going to try and take it away from him.

210
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
going to try and take it away from him.
 

211
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,390
going to try and take it away from him.
He gives me a yokoi. And that sets up my

212
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
He gives me a yokoi. And that sets up my
 

213
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,110
He gives me a yokoi. And that sets up my
kodash and go into here like this. And

214
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
kodash and go into here like this. And
 

215
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,430
kodash and go into here like this. And
then there's a niko yet again. Boom. And

216
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
then there's a niko yet again. Boom. And
 

217
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,550
then there's a niko yet again. Boom. And
that's the kod. But I'm not going to

218
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
that's the kod. But I'm not going to
 

219
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,509
that's the kod. But I'm not going to
take it because I want something

220
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
take it because I want something
 

221
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,350
take it because I want something
different right now. Sono doesn't matter

222
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
different right now. Sono doesn't matter
 

223
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,390
different right now. Sono doesn't matter
what we do. I just didn't want to do

224
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
what we do. I just didn't want to do
 

225
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,229
what we do. I just didn't want to do
Niko Kota Niko guys over and over. And

226
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
Niko Kota Niko guys over and over. And
 

227
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,270
Niko Kota Niko guys over and over. And
if it works out that way, it works out

228
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
if it works out that way, it works out
 

229
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,750
if it works out that way, it works out
that way. But what you're building

230
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
that way. But what you're building
 

231
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,630
that way. But what you're building
towards is a more active practice. Now,

232
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
towards is a more active practice. Now,
 

233
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,309
towards is a more active practice. Now,
if I have the knife away for too long,

234
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
if I have the knife away for too long,
 

235
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,070
if I have the knife away for too long,
I'm just going to present my hand again

236
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
I'm just going to present my hand again
 

237
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,670
I'm just going to present my hand again
and he's going to get it right. Most of

238
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
and he's going to get it right. Most of
 

239
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,430
and he's going to get it right. Most of
the time though, I'll give it to him in

240
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
the time though, I'll give it to him in
 

241
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,110
the time though, I'll give it to him in
some kind of cutting action, right? And

242
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
some kind of cutting action, right? And
 

243
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,710
some kind of cutting action, right? And
he'll work from there to get it out,

244
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
he'll work from there to get it out,
 

245
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,869
he'll work from there to get it out,
right? But when we're going at it, we're

246
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
right? But when we're going at it, we're
 

247
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,550
right? But when we're going at it, we're
not really giving the knife to each

248
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
not really giving the knife to each
 

249
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,750
not really giving the knife to each
other at all. We're just kind of trying

250
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
other at all. We're just kind of trying
 

251
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,030
other at all. We're just kind of trying
to take the knife and get the knife. And

252
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
to take the knife and get the knife. And
 

253
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,390
to take the knife and get the knife. And
you'll see other techniques appear. So,

254
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
you'll see other techniques appear. So,
 

255
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:33,749
you'll see other techniques appear. So,
it should look like this. Yep.

256
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759

 

257
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:59,830

Nice.

258
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840

 

259
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:26,029

couple.

260
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:26,039

 

261
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,230

Okay. So, you get the basic idea from

262
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
Okay. So, you get the basic idea from
 

263
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,990
Okay. So, you get the basic idea from
that. So, you're going to see the

264
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
that. So, you're going to see the
 

265
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,150
that. So, you're going to see the
techniques appear over and over again

266
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
techniques appear over and over again
 

267
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,510
techniques appear over and over again
because you're giving each other the

268
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
because you're giving each other the
 

269
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,590
because you're giving each other the
opportunity to do the techniques. So,

270
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
opportunity to do the techniques. So,
 

271
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,390
opportunity to do the techniques. So,
that's not it at its highest level.

272
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
that's not it at its highest level.
 

273
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,710
that's not it at its highest level.
you're going to have to go another level

274
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
you're going to have to go another level
 

275
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,790
you're going to have to go another level
up. You won't see as many techniques,

276
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
up. You won't see as many techniques,
 

277
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,550
up. You won't see as many techniques,
but for developing the setups for the

278
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
but for developing the setups for the
 

279
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,550
but for developing the setups for the
techniques, that's the best way to go.

280
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
techniques, that's the best way to go.
 

281
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,390
techniques, that's the best way to go.
All right. So, I'm Christopher Hine.

282
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
All right. So, I'm Christopher Hine.
 

283
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,790
All right. So, I'm Christopher Hine.
Josh Te my song is behind that camera

284
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
Josh Te my song is behind that camera
 

285
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
Josh Te my song is behind that camera
right there.
