so we're going looking at the the uh

4
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
so we're going looking at the the uh
 

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,110
so we're going looking at the the uh
grappling from uh Fury day the buried

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
grappling from uh Fury day the buried

flowers B now postes used in the

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:36,760
flowers B now postes used in the
 

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,150
flowers B now postes used in the
grappling and very similar to those used

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
grappling and very similar to those used
 

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,150
grappling and very similar to those used
for dagger and sword so it suggest it's

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
for dagger and sword so it suggest it's
 

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,029
for dagger and sword so it suggest it's
a combined system which means it's not

14
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
a combined system which means it's not
 

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,069
a combined system which means it's not
going to be like a modern wrestling

16
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:47,079
going to be like a modern wrestling
 

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,510
going to be like a modern wrestling
where you're gra you know grappling

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
where you're gra you know grappling
 

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,869
where you're gra you know grappling
clinching and going to the groundw it's

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:51,879
clinching and going to the groundw it's
 

21
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,990
clinching and going to the groundw it's
going to be probably more more mobile

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,000
going to be probably more more mobile
 

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,869
going to be probably more more mobile
and uh avoiding getting stuck so

24
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
and uh avoiding getting stuck so
 

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,189
and uh avoiding getting stuck so
we're going to look at it from that

26
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:02,199
we're going to look at it from that
 

27
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,710
we're going to look at it from that
perspective and I think when I starting

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
perspective and I think when I starting
 

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,350
perspective and I think when I starting
to look at the postures it sort of shows

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
to look at the postures it sort of shows
 

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,590
to look at the postures it sort of shows
that is how it's design okay so there

32
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
that is how it's design okay so there
 

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,429
that is how it's design okay so there
four postures uh that they're shown two

34
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:12,439
four postures uh that they're shown two

is a a good receiving posture but it's

84
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:25,319
is a a good receiving posture but it's
 

85
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,190
is a a good receiving posture but it's
also a good posture for breaking things

86
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
also a good posture for breaking things
 

87
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,589
also a good posture for breaking things
and dis eting things because the whole

88
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
and dis eting things because the whole
 

89
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,270
and dis eting things because the whole
point of this is not

90
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
point of this is not
 

91
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,589
point of this is not
to get into you know a friendly

92
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:36,599
to get into you know a friendly
 

93
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,589
to get into you know a friendly
wrestling match it's to dispose of the

94
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:38,599
wrestling match it's to dispose of the
 

95
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,270
wrestling match it's to dispose of the
person doing a great deal of damage as

96
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,280
person doing a great deal of damage as
 

97
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,589
person doing a great deal of damage as
fast as you can so the Iron Gate is

98
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:42,599
fast as you can so the Iron Gate is
 

99
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,070
fast as you can so the Iron Gate is
probably the most important posture but

100
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
probably the most important posture but
 

101
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,750
probably the most important posture but
it's not shown in any explicitly anyway

102
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:46,760
it's not shown in any explicitly anyway
 

103
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,390
it's not shown in any explicitly anyway
any of the other pictures as they go

104
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,400
any of the other pictures as they go
 

105
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,670
any of the other pictures as they go
through the technique so you have you'd

106
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:52,680
through the technique so you have you'd
 

107
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,229
through the technique so you have you'd
have to infer it's

108
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
have to infer it's
 

109
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,110
have to infer it's
there um at the beginning and sometime

110
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,120
there um at the beginning and sometime
 

111

113
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,190

okay so the we going look at the first

114
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
okay so the we going look at the first
 

115
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,190
okay so the we going look at the first
and second plays so the first

116
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,200
and second plays so the first
 

117
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,710
and second plays so the first
play The Defender starts in uh the

118
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
play The Defender starts in uh the
 

119
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,309
play The Defender starts in uh the
frontal posture and then it looks like

120
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
frontal posture and then it looks like
 

121
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,509
frontal posture and then it looks like
it moves to the ball's tooth and that's

122
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:16,519
it moves to the ball's tooth and that's
 

123
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,430
it moves to the ball's tooth and that's
the only picture in the series that has

124
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:20,440
the only picture in the series that has
 

125
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,430
the only picture in the series that has
that so I you know I assume that is that

126
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
that so I you know I assume that is that
 

127
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,110
that so I you know I assume that is that
and then from there it will go to Iron

128
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,120
and then from there it will go to Iron
 

129
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,429
and then from there it will go to Iron

crack into the

238
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759

241
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,510
floor so there's no easy you can't
really half do it without him Landing

242
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,520
really half do it without him Landing
 

243
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,189
really half do it without him Landing
quite

244
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:42,199

 

245
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,710

heavily okay the eight plays a pressure

246
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
heavily okay the eight plays a pressure
 

247
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,790
heavily okay the eight plays a pressure
point technique it's pressure point just

248
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:47,800
point technique it's pressure point just
 

249
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,309
point technique it's pressure point just
behind the ear there which is very

250
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
behind the ear there which is very
 

251
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,629
behind the ear there which is very
painful so he's going for a throw as he

252
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:53,639
painful so he's going for a throw as he
 

253
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,230
painful so he's going for a throw as he
goes for it I push into the pressure

254
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,240
goes for it I push into the pressure
 

255
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,790
goes for it I push into the pressure
point here this makes him gives him a

256
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
point here this makes him gives him a
 

257
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,350
point here this makes him gives him a
bit of a pause from there I can then

258
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
bit of a pause from there I can then
 

259
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,869
bit of a pause from there I can then
going to protect me okay so this is the

260
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:04,879
going to protect me okay so this is the
 

261
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,869
going to protect me okay so this is the
counter to the eighth play he pushes up

262
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:07,879
counter to the eighth play he pushes up
 

263
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,110
counter to the eighth play he pushes up
on the elbow this push up on the elbow

264
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,120
on the elbow this push up on the elbow
 

265
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,550
on the elbow this push up on the elbow
is used four times uh in the whole

266
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
is used four times uh in the whole
 

267
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,550
is used four times uh in the whole
sequence so it's quite a common defense

268
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
sequence so it's quite a common defense
 

269
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,189
sequence so it's quite a common defense
so he's going for the throw I go for the

270
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
so he's going for the throw I go for the
 

271
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,309
so he's going for the throw I go for the
pressure point he

272
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:21,319
pressure point he
 

273
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,270
pressure point he
now brings arm

274
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,280

 

275
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,189

over this this is the ninth play it's a

276
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:32,199
over this this is the ninth play it's a
 

277
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,469
over this this is the ninth play it's a
grab from behind now that kind of

278
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
grab from behind now that kind of
 

279
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,589
grab from behind now that kind of
suggests maybe there's it's not a

280
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
suggests maybe there's it's not a
 

281
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,830
suggests maybe there's it's not a
