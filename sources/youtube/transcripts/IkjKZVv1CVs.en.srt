so
 

43
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,910
so
um the energy that i have to use has to

44
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
um the energy that i have to use has to
 

45
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,590
um the energy that i have to use has to
be that energy

46
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600

 

47
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,510

so i can't go

48
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
so i can't go
 

49
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,190
so i can't go
here and

50
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
here and
 

51
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,469
here and
this is no too late you see he already

52
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
this is no too late you see he already
 

53
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,550
this is no too late you see he already
touched you in fact he's already coming

55
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,590
touched you in fact he's already coming
in so if you pay attention he does that

56
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
in so if you pay attention he does that
 

57
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,230
in so if you pay attention he does that
same thing if i stay there there's no

58
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
same thing if i stay there there's no
 

59
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,109
same thing if i stay there there's no
way that's too much energy okay

60
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
way that's too much energy okay
 

61
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,990
way that's too much energy okay
so

62
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
so
 

63
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,990
