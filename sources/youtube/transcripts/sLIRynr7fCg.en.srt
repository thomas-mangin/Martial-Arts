I was going to do nikel nikel can't be

00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,280
I was going to do nikel nikel can't be
 

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,710
I was going to do nikel nikel can't be
on when my hand goes down okay uh Niko's

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:17,720
on when my hand goes down okay uh Niko's
 

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,310
on when my hand goes down okay uh Niko's
already on Niko's already on try to

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,320
already on Niko's already on try to
 

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,830
already on Niko's already on try to
stand

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:22,840
stand
 

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,230
stand
up you get it it's not I don't go here

14
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
up you get it it's not I don't go here
 

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,349
up you get it it's not I don't go here
and then go down you see how it's off

16
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:28,359
and then go down you see how it's off
 

17
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,230
and then go down you see how it's off
and then on as as soon as I come it's on

18
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,240
and then on as as soon as I come it's on
 

19
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,670
and then on as as soon as I come it's on
it's on right away if I'm going to do

20
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
it's on right away if I'm going to do
 

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,830
it's on right away if I'm going to do
katame same thing here it's not off and

22
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:38,840
katame same thing here it's not off and
 

23
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,549
katame same thing here it's not off and
then on okay so if I'm if I'm here it's

24
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:43,559
then on okay so if I'm if I'm here it's
 

25
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,310
then on okay so if I'm if I'm here it's
on already even even if it looks like

26
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
on already even even if it looks like
 

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,270
on already even even if it looks like
it's not completed it's on already okay

28
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
it's not completed it's on already okay
 

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,590
it's not completed it's on already okay
if I'm going to do katama again as I'm

30
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:52,600
if I'm going to do katama again as I'm
 

31
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,630
if I'm going to do katama again as I'm
working it it's already on so that I

32
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:55,640
working it it's already on so that I
 

33
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,069
working it it's already on so that I
don't have to do these movements do you

34
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
don't have to do these movements do you
 

35
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,430
don't have to do these movements do you
see right as we land he want wanted to

36
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,440
see right as we land he want wanted to
 

37
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,350
see right as we land he want wanted to
tap okay so the same

38
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,360
tap okay so the same
 

39
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,950
tap okay so the same
thing if I'm

40
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960

 

41
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,270

working this lock if I make these if I

42
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,280
working this lock if I make these if I
 

43
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,429
working this lock if I make these if I
have to make these big gross movements

44
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
have to make these big gross movements
 

45
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,830
have to make these big gross movements
then it's not going to it's not ideal

46
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
then it's not going to it's not ideal
 

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,789
then it's not going to it's not ideal
okay so let's say he's pushing on me

48
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
okay so let's say he's pushing on me
 

49
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,510
okay so let's say he's pushing on me
right and as I'm working that same body

50
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:22,520
right and as I'm working that same body
 

51
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,429
right and as I'm working that same body
it's it's already on which I won't do

52
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
it's it's already on which I won't do
 

53
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,510
it's it's already on which I won't do
the mat part but it's on already do you

54
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
the mat part but it's on already do you
 

55
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,350
the mat part but it's on already do you
see yes sir so when I get here

56
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,360
see yes sir so when I get here
 

57
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,069
see yes sir so when I get here
that's why you notice that I didn't

58
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
that's why you notice that I didn't
 

59
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,910
that's why you notice that I didn't
really move and it's already

60
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
really move and it's already
 

61
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,270
really move and it's already
on you don't have to do these big

62
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,280
on you don't have to do these big
 

63
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,270
on you don't have to do these big
movements save that for when it counts

64
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
movements save that for when it counts
 

65
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,190
movements save that for when it counts
okay but when you're idealized

66
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
okay but when you're idealized
 

67
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,550
okay but when you're idealized
environment you you should be tight at

68
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
environment you you should be tight at
 

69
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,230
environment you you should be tight at
contact and it's only getting tighter

70
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
contact and it's only getting tighter
 

71
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,749
contact and it's only getting tighter
without the movement going on okay all

72
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
without the movement going on okay all
 

73
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,759
without the movement going on okay all
right
