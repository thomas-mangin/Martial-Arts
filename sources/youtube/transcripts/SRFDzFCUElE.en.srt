again we don't know we just use Andrew's

174
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
again we don't know we just use Andrew's
 

175
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,150
again we don't know we just use Andrew's
figure the smartest one so he he said

176
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
figure the smartest one so he he said
 

177
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,189
figure the smartest one so he he said
the qua movement's about 30° so you have

178
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
the qua movement's about 30° so you have
 

179
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,830
the qua movement's about 30° so you have
about 30° in the quaw and once it runs

180
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
about 30° in the quaw and once it runs
 

181
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,309
about 30° in the quaw and once it runs
out then you're going to change the

182
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:29,319
out then you're going to change the
 

183
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,070
out then you're going to change the
other the foot you're you're not going

184
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,080
other the foot you're you're not going
 

185
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,870
other the foot you're you're not going
to keep uh P pivoting that foot okay cuz

186
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
to keep uh P pivoting that foot okay cuz
 

187
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,390
to keep uh P pivoting that foot okay cuz
you'll go heel weight so I go back for

188
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
you'll go heel weight so I go back for
 

189
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,590
you'll go heel weight so I go back for
the absorption and then I have that

190
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
the absorption and then I have that
 

191
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,749
the absorption and then I have that
30° that I have on the quad and then

192
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:46,759
30° that I have on the quad and then
 

193
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,510
30° that I have on the quad and then
we're going to run out and so that's

194
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:48,520
we're going to run out and so that's
 

195
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,110
we're going to run out and so that's
when that

196
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,120
when that
 

197
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,749
when that
30° I now shift onto the front foot and

198
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
30° I now shift onto the front foot and
 

199
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,270
30° I now shift onto the front foot and
I get it on this foot do do you guys see

200
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
I get it on this foot do do you guys see
 

201
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,830
I get it on this foot do do you guys see
that so that's that's telling you what

202
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:58,840
that so that's that's telling you what
 

203
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,510
that so that's that's telling you what
you're going to do

204
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,520
you're going to do
 

205
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,110
you're going to do
so

206
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,120
so
 

207
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,550
so
one qua now he passes you

208
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
one qua now he passes you
 

209
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,110
one qua now he passes you
sorta so you have to get to the other

210
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
sorta so you have to get to the other
 

211
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,990
sorta so you have to get to the other
side of him you see when you shift your

212
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,000
side of him you see when you shift your
 

213
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,150
side of him you see when you shift your
weight you're now on the back of him

214
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,160
weight you're now on the back of him
 

215
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,029
weight you're now on the back of him
okay and then you bring him around in

216
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,039
okay and then you bring him around in
 

217
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,070
okay and then you bring him around in
that technique in that part you bring

218
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
that technique in that part you bring
 

219
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,230
that technique in that part you bring
him around and then there it

220
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,240
him around and then there it
 

221
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,270
him around and then there it
is so there's no straight on your

222
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,280
is so there's no straight on your
 

223
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,550
is so there's no straight on your
knee and yes he's on a circle but I'm

224
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
knee and yes he's on a circle but I'm
 

225
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,430
knee and yes he's on a circle but I'm
I'm not making in a

226
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:30,440
I'm not making in a
 

227
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,790
I'm not making in a
circle

228
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
circle
 

229
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,950
circle
okay so watch how I'm doing this on the

230
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
okay so watch how I'm doing this on the
 

231
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,990
okay so watch how I'm doing this on the
back foot that's the first yield starts

232
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
back foot that's the first yield starts
 

233
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,510
back foot that's the first yield starts
the rotation with the qua it's going to

234
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,520
the rotation with the qua it's going to
 

235
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,870
the rotation with the qua it's going to
run out shift onto the other foot quaw

236
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
run out shift onto the other foot quaw
 

237
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,430
run out shift onto the other foot quaw
again let him pause and you're

238
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,440

 

239
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,309

in double

240
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
in double
 

241
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,830
in double
pivoting it's it's not working and he

242
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:56,840
pivoting it's it's not working and he
 

243
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,390
pivoting it's it's not working and he
knows that's why it's he's smiling every

244
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,400
knows that's why it's he's smiling every
 

245
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,790
knows that's why it's he's smiling every
time I do this cuz there's no power I

246
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:01,800
time I do this cuz there's no power I
 

247
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,390
time I do this cuz there's no power I
have I have no ability to get him around

248
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,400
have I have no ability to get him around
 

249
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,469
have I have no ability to get him around
like that

250
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
like that
 

251
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,469
like that
okay but that's me making a

252
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:11,479
okay but that's me making a
 

253
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,710
okay but that's me making a
circle with my my hips rotate you see my

254
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
circle with my my hips rotate you see my
 

255
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,710
circle with my my hips rotate you see my
hips are rotating but they're using like

256
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:17,720
hips are rotating but they're using like
 

257
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,189
hips are rotating but they're using like
straight lines in a way to do

258
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:20,199
straight lines in a way to do
 

259
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,710
straight lines in a way to do
it so

260
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
it so
 

261
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,350
it so
one 2 3 four and it's so it's much

262
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,360
one 2 3 four and it's so it's much
 

263
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,950
one 2 3 four and it's so it's much
easier than you think

264
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:29,960
easier than you think
 

265
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,869
easier than you think
CU there's way less

266
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:34,879

 

267
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,520

movement okay try
