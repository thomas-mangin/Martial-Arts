5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,790

I I read your comments and I just filmed

6
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
I I read your comments and I just filmed
 

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,389
I I read your comments and I just filmed
uh uh two of myi doing it different UK

8
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
uh uh two of myi doing it different UK
 

9
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,470
uh uh two of myi doing it different UK
different ukmi skills and both of the

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,480
different ukmi skills and both of the
 

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,110
different ukmi skills and both of the
nagas did the same thing which which is

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,120
nagas did the same thing which which is
 

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,910
nagas did the same thing which which is
totally fine um they're not shoving the

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:50,920
totally fine um they're not shoving the
 

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,750
totally fine um they're not shoving the
head down of the

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
head down of the
 

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,069
head down of the
UK and so you what I would say is watch

18
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,079
UK and so you what I would say is watch
 

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,549
UK and so you what I would say is watch
those two clips and notice how the UK's

20
00:00:59,549 --> 00:00:59,559
those two clips and notice how the UK's
 

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,069
those two clips and notice how the UK's
head stays at the same distance from the

22
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
head stays at the same distance from the
 

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,990
head stays at the same distance from the
M

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
M
 

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,550
M
okay um that's the first thing to notice

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
okay um that's the first thing to notice
 

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,149
okay um that's the first thing to notice
so they're not the UK in other words is

28
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
so they're not the UK in other words is
 

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,870
so they're not the UK in other words is
not having their head shoved down and

30
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
not having their head shoved down and
 

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,190
not having their head shoved down and
then being told to bring their head up

32
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,200
then being told to bring their head up
 

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,590
then being told to bring their head up
that that's not what's happening what

34
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:20,600
that that's not what's happening what
 

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,749
that that's not what's happening what
happened is uh they did not take the

36
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:24,759
happened is uh they did not take the
 

37
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,789
happened is uh they did not take the
UK's head down and they worked with

38
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
UK's head down and they worked with
 

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,270
UK's head down and they worked with
where the head was at so the nag

40
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
where the head was at so the nag
 

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,350
where the head was at so the nag
adjusted for what the UK was

42
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,360
adjusted for what the UK was
 

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,469
adjusted for what the UK was
doing now granted in some of my versions

44
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
doing now granted in some of my versions
 

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,630
doing now granted in some of my versions
uh UK is taken outside of their uh base

46
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:43,640
uh UK is taken outside of their uh base
 

47
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,149
uh UK is taken outside of their uh base
of support that is possible by their

48
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
of support that is possible by their
 

49
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,870
of support that is possible by their
hands and their head does sometimes hit

50
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
hands and their head does sometimes hit
 

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,630
hands and their head does sometimes hit
the mat okay um and as I said the

52
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,640
the mat okay um and as I said the
 

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,870
the mat okay um and as I said the
pressure on that head is off much ear

54
00:01:59,870 --> 00:01:59,880
pressure on that head is off much ear
 

55
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,910
pressure on that head is off much ear
earlier than bonai things okay so uh let

56
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
earlier than bonai things okay so uh let
 

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,429
earlier than bonai things okay so uh let
me have that that one okay so when I

58
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
me have that that one okay so when I
 

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,029
me have that that one okay so when I
come here the pressure is off already

60
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
come here the pressure is off already
 

61
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,710
come here the pressure is off already
that that's enough okay um so here is

62
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:15,720
that that's enough okay um so here is
 

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,869
that that's enough okay um so here is
where they all did it and this is fine

64
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
where they all did it and this is fine
 

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,150
where they all did it and this is fine
now the UK is not lifting their head up

66
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
now the UK is not lifting their head up
 

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,910
now the UK is not lifting their head up
but the UK

68
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
but the UK
 

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,869
but the UK
stopped themselves from putting their

70
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
stopped themselves from putting their
 

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,430
stopped themselves from putting their
head down

72
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,440
head down
 

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,990
head down
and that is upward energy okay so we'll

74
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
and that is upward energy okay so we'll
 

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,509
and that is upward energy okay so we'll
rewind the film a little when he goes

76
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
rewind the film a little when he goes
 

77
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,949
rewind the film a little when he goes
boom that's what I take forward that

78
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:39,959
boom that's what I take forward that
 

79
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,630
boom that's what I take forward that
energy I take forward not

80
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:43,640
energy I take forward not
 

81
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,070
energy I take forward not
here and then I say hey move forward

82
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,080
here and then I say hey move forward
 

83
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,070
here and then I say hey move forward
move forward there you go and then I go

84
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
move forward there you go and then I go
 

85
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,070
move forward there you go and then I go
that's not what happens

86
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,080
that's not what happens
 

87
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,589
that's not what happens
okay so the theuk has a choice that's

88
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
okay so the theuk has a choice that's
 

89
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,270
okay so the theuk has a choice that's
what I take forward the

90
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,280
what I take forward the
 

91
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,030
what I take forward the
the reput of their base of support

92
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,040
the reput of their base of support
 

93
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,550
the reput of their base of support
underneath their line of gravity is

94
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
underneath their line of gravity is
 

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,830
underneath their line of gravity is
upward energy and that's the upward

96
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,840
upward energy and that's the upward
 

97
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,869
upward energy and that's the upward
energy that I take forward okay um on on

98
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:11,879
energy that I take forward okay um on on
 

99
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,550
energy that I take forward okay um on on
some of my versions you see how I went

100
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
some of my versions you see how I went
 

101
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,470
some of my versions you see how I went
outside his hands okay um and then the

102
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
outside his hands okay um and then the
 

103
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,149
outside his hands okay um and then the
instinct is to do exactly what he did so

104
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:23,159
instinct is to do exactly what he did so
 

105
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,589
instinct is to do exactly what he did so
that hand wasn't

106
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
that hand wasn't
 

107
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,309
that hand wasn't
there wait yeah he's over here okay he

108
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
there wait yeah he's over here okay he
 

109
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,229
there wait yeah he's over here okay he
used his elbow that's upward energy so I

110
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
used his elbow that's upward energy so I
 

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,030
used his elbow that's upward energy so I
took that energy and I take it outside

112
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,040
took that energy and I take it outside
 

113
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,949
took that energy and I take it outside
that facee and now he put that hand down

114
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
that facee and now he put that hand down
 

115
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,789
that facee and now he put that hand down
that's the same upward energy and that's

116
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
that's the same upward energy and that's
 

117
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,190
that's the same upward energy and that's
what I take

118
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
what I take
 

119
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,070
what I take
forward

120
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,080
forward
 

121
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,309
forward
okay um

122
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:49,319
okay um
 

123
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,270
okay um
so in both cases if I'm looking at it in

124
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,280
so in both cases if I'm looking at it in
 

125
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,390
so in both cases if I'm looking at it in
the first case

126
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
the first case
 

127
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,030
the first case
they tactically

128
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,040
they tactically
 

129
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,789
they tactically
put them uh put the UK in a place where

130
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
put them uh put the UK in a place where
 

131
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,869
put them uh put the UK in a place where
they are able to put their base of

132
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
they are able to put their base of
 

133
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,830
they are able to put their base of
support back underneath and they will

134
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:10,840
support back underneath and they will
 

135
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,630
support back underneath and they will
the UK will and you're UK too okay

136
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:13,640
the UK will and you're UK too okay
 

137
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,430
the UK will and you're UK too okay
they'll put their hands

138
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,440
they'll put their hands
 

139
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,990
they'll put their hands
there but what you're not seeing is that

140
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,000
there but what you're not seeing is that
 

141
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,870
there but what you're not seeing is that
is upward energy that's the upward

142
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
is upward energy that's the upward
 

143
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,710
is upward energy that's the upward
energy that you take forward it's not

144
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
energy that you take forward it's not
 

145
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,189
energy that you take forward it's not
the head it's not that they get told to

146
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
the head it's not that they get told to
 

147
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,350
the head it's not that they get told to
lift their head or told to go forward or

148
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,360
lift their head or told to go forward or
 

149
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,310
lift their head or told to go forward or
or something like that it's only there

150
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
or something like that it's only there
 

151
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,830
or something like that it's only there
for a moment but you only need a moment

152
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:32,840
for a moment but you only need a moment
 

153
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,150
for a moment but you only need a moment
okay in my version I just fanned him out

154
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,160
okay in my version I just fanned him out
 

155
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,270
okay in my version I just fanned him out
more but structurally it's the same

156
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
more but structurally it's the same
 

157
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,270
more but structurally it's the same
exact thing and sometimes I do it

158
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
exact thing and sometimes I do it
 

159
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,749
exact thing and sometimes I do it
exactly like they did it okay um it's

160
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
exactly like they did it okay um it's
 

161
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,270
exactly like they did it okay um it's
still a matter of when they

162
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,280
still a matter of when they
 

163
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,430
still a matter of when they
post that is what you take up okay in

164
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,440
post that is what you take up okay in
 

165
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,950

either
case I am off of the downward much

168
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
case I am off of the downward much
 

169
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,710
case I am off of the downward much
earlier than bonai is okay so what I

170
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:03,720
earlier than bonai is okay so what I
 

171
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,390
earlier than bonai is okay so what I
mean by that is bonai goes here you see

172
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,400
mean by that is bonai goes here you see
 

173
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,710
mean by that is bonai goes here you see
and now uh he he actually feels pinned

174
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
and now uh he he actually feels pinned
 

175
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,749
and now uh he he actually feels pinned
so why would he push up on it okay and

176
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
so why would he push up on it okay and
 

177
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,550
so why would he push up on it okay and
then you want to go hey try to get up

178
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
then you want to go hey try to get up
 

179
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,950
then you want to go hey try to get up
and then then you go like this you see

180
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
and then then you go like this you see
 

181
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,950
and then then you go like this you see
but what does bonai do as is they're

182
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:21,960
but what does bonai do as is they're
 

183
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,990
but what does bonai do as is they're
holding here he pins here and then you

184
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
holding here he pins here and then you
 

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,710
holding here he pins here and then you
go here like this okay so you're trying

186
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
go here like this okay so you're trying

go here like this okay so you're trying
to mix Styles but they they don't they

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:29,800
to mix Styles but they they don't they
 

189
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,710
to mix Styles but they they don't they
don't mix

190
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:31,720
don't mix
 

191
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,309
don't mix
okay so as I'm

192
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:34,319
okay so as I'm
 

193
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,870
okay so as I'm
going you can see I'm way

194
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:37,880
going you can see I'm way
 

195
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,309
going you can see I'm way
off of the downward of the downward

196
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:41,319
off of the downward of the downward
 

197
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,309
off of the downward of the downward
there's really no downward at all it's

198
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:43,319
there's really no downward at all it's
 

199
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,590
there's really no downward at all it's
more that 90°

200
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
more that 90°
 

201
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,270
more that 90°
modulation my hand is still on him just

202
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
modulation my hand is still on him just
 

203
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,590
modulation my hand is still on him just
because I'm keeping the connection I'm

204
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
because I'm keeping the connection I'm
 

205
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,350
because I'm keeping the connection I'm
keeping the connection he's not keeping

206
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
keeping the connection he's not keeping
 

207
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,990
keeping the connection he's not keeping
the connection okay so let's say then

208
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
the connection okay so let's say then
 

209
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,309
the connection okay so let's say then
that's what's happening

210
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
that's what's happening
 

211
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,749
that's what's happening
and he only goes to

212
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:02,759
and he only goes to
 

213
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,390
and he only goes to
here

214
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
here
 

215
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,749
here
okay his head is quite high but that

216
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:08,759
okay his head is quite high but that
 

217
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,350
okay his head is quite high but that
upward pressure of the post is what I

218
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,360
upward pressure of the post is what I
 

219
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,110
upward pressure of the post is what I
use to do this whole

220
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
use to do this whole
 

221
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,830
use to do this whole
movement

222
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:16,840
movement
 

223
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,510
movement
okay the problem that I'm

224
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
okay the problem that I'm
 

225
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,110
okay the problem that I'm
seeing is you are in the wrong place for

226
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
seeing is you are in the wrong place for
 

227
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,749
seeing is you are in the wrong place for
this what you have to do wherever you

228
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:26,759
this what you have to do wherever you
 

229
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,189
this what you have to do wherever you
wore so if I in my a lot of my

230
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
wore so if I in my a lot of my
 

231
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,950
wore so if I in my a lot of my
variations I'm over

232
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:31,960
variations I'm over
 

233
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,909
variations I'm over
here some variations here by Dy tend to

234
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
here some variations here by Dy tend to
 

235
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,270
here some variations here by Dy tend to
be here I've seen some people over here

236
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
be here I've seen some people over here
 

237
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,150
be here I've seen some people over here
whatever the variation is of where you

238
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
whatever the variation is of where you
 

239
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,189
whatever the variation is of where you
are as you neutralize this upper energy

240
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,199
are as you neutralize this upper energy
 

241
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,309
are as you neutralize this upper energy
with the 90°

242
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
with the 90°
 

243
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,070
with the 90°
modulation you have to move

244
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,080
modulation you have to move
 

245
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,430
modulation you have to move
yourself to where that's going to be so

246
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
yourself to where that's going to be so
 

247
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,990
yourself to where that's going to be so
here is his post let's let's rewind it

248
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,000
here is his post let's let's rewind it
 

249
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,070
here is his post let's let's rewind it
goes

250
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
goes
 

251
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,350
goes
boom and I move it I'm in the wrong

252
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
boom and I move it I'm in the wrong
 

253
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,189
boom and I move it I'm in the wrong
place I'm going to have to use my arm

254
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:06,199
place I'm going to have to use my arm
 

255
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,150
place I'm going to have to use my arm
here my

256
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
here my
 

257
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,909
here my
shoulder should have been

258
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:12,919

 

259
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,469

here you move

260
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
here you move
 

261
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,629
here you move
yourself where you need to

262
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:19,639
yourself where you need to
 

263
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,749
yourself where you need to
be if you can't move

264
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:22,759
be if you can't move
 

265
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,270
be if you can't move
them so if I'm here that's it that

266
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,280
them so if I'm here that's it that
 

267
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,869
them so if I'm here that's it that
worked that's the technique

268
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:29,879
worked that's the technique
 

269
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,309
worked that's the technique
he posted that's what I brought around

270
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:33,319
he posted that's what I brought around
 

271
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,830
he posted that's what I brought around
into my position to do the technique

272
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
into my position to do the technique
 

273
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,710
into my position to do the technique
he's not anywhere where I have to use

274
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:39,720
he's not anywhere where I have to use
 

275
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,550
he's not anywhere where I have to use
this hand because this hand cannot

276
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
this hand because this hand cannot
 

277
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,319
this hand because this hand cannot
function at the 90° modulations okay
