504
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:16,860

 

505
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,790

I was thinking of something the other

506
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:19,800
I was thinking of something the other
 

507
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,590
I was thinking of something the other
day while teaching

508
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
day while teaching
 

509
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,530
day while teaching
and you'll notice sometimes with the

510
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:24,540
and you'll notice sometimes with the
 

511
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,290
and you'll notice sometimes with the
feet those of you are good with your

512
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,300
feet those of you are good with your
 

513
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,389
feet those of you are good with your
eyes ah

514
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:29,399
eyes ah
 

515
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,449
eyes ah
perhaps always you don't quite get as

516
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:32,459
perhaps always you don't quite get as
 

517
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,250
perhaps always you don't quite get as
deep as you'd like

518
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,260
deep as you'd like
 

519
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,110
deep as you'd like
and nobody tells you about the extra

520
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,120
and nobody tells you about the extra
 

521
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,370
and nobody tells you about the extra
step

522
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:37,380
step
 

523
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,930
step
so now with the back leg I go

524
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:41,940

 

525
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,269

and I'm not far enough

526
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:44,279
and I'm not far enough
 

527
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,550
and I'm not far enough
so I'm starting to have to work hard to

528
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
so I'm starting to have to work hard to
 

529
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,509
so I'm starting to have to work hard to
move him

530
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
move him
 

531
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,750
move him
so I need this leg to move up but I'm

532
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:50,760
so I need this leg to move up but I'm
 

533
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,769
so I need this leg to move up but I'm
already committed so it's difficult

534
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:54,779
already committed so it's difficult
 

535
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,069
already committed so it's difficult
to bring the leg in to do this

536
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
to bring the leg in to do this
 

537
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,870
to bring the leg in to do this
and that wouldn't be that wouldn't be

538

and that wouldn't be that wouldn't be
 

539
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,069
and that wouldn't be that wouldn't be
any good

540
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079
any good
 

541
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,470
any good
so

542
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:03,480
so
 

543
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,129
so
you have to do

544
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:06,139
you have to do
 

545
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,170

546
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,180
and then bring this leg in you have to
 

547
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,850
and then bring this leg in you have to
make the adjustment now you have to

548
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:10,860
make the adjustment now you have to
 

549
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,530

one
 

553
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,930
one
so because you need then to find the

554
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:17,940
so because you need then to find the
 

555
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,370
so because you need then to find the
distance

556
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:19,380
distance
 

557
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,790
distance
you can't find it afterwards

558
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
you can't find it afterwards
 

559
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,290
you can't find it afterwards
so

560
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,300
