1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,629

things you can't see but you're defying

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:02,639
things you can't see but you're defying
 

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,670
things you can't see but you're defying
angles that's all those scentsy done

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
angles that's all those scentsy done
 

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,310
angles that's all those scentsy done
was he defined angles so

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
was he defined angles so
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,589
was he defined angles so
so when

8
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
so when
 

9
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:19,590
so when
in the example where you um

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600

 

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,550

yeah

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
yeah
 

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,590
yeah
i can't push it

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
i can't push it
 

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,790
i can't push it
what i'm doing is i'm blocking his

16
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
what i'm doing is i'm blocking his
 

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,150
what i'm doing is i'm blocking his
forward

18
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
forward
 

19
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,189
forward
angle

20
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
angle
 

21
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,229
angle
and i'm making i'm dissipating all his

22
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
and i'm making i'm dissipating all his
 

23
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,830
and i'm making i'm dissipating all his
power

24
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
power
 

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,790
power
in

26
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
in
 

27
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,670
in
in another direction to what is the

28
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
in another direction to what is the
 

29
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,069
in another direction to what is the
optimal illusion of everybody seeing him

30
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
optimal illusion of everybody seeing him
 

31
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,750
optimal illusion of everybody seeing him
going that way

32
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
going that way
 

33
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,069
going that way
so instead of it going the way if i was

34
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
so instead of it going the way if i was
 

35
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,990
so instead of it going the way if i was
trying to stop him the way like danny

36
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
trying to stop him the way like danny
 

37
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,350
trying to stop him the way like danny
was if i was trying to stop him going

38
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
was if i was trying to stop him going
 

39
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,950
was if i was trying to stop him going
that way my hand's going to either go

40
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
that way my hand's going to either go
 

41
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,670
that way my hand's going to either go
round or go like that with him

42
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
round or go like that with him
 

43
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,910
round or go like that with him
if i take hold of it

44
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
if i take hold of it
 

45
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,189
if i take hold of it
and i extend it that way but without him

46
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
and i extend it that way but without him
 

47
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,670
and i extend it that way but without him
seeing that that physical i can't

48
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
seeing that that physical i can't
 

49
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,430
seeing that that physical i can't
physically do it because he's too

50
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
physically do it because he's too
 

51
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,549
physically do it because he's too
powerful so i just think it and i go

52
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
powerful so i just think it and i go
 

53
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,350
powerful so i just think it and i go
down a little and in

54
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360

 

55
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,710

my mouth

56
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
my mouth
 

57
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,149
my mouth
my mass i'm doing this with my mass and

58
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
my mass i'm doing this with my mass and
 

59
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,630
my mass i'm doing this with my mass and
once i've got him then i can almost take

60
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
once i've got him then i can almost take
 

61
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,830
once i've got him then i can almost take
it off and

62
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
it off and
 

63
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,990
it off and
do that because i've

64
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
do that because i've
 

65
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,590
do that because i've
i've locked him so once he's locked

66
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
i've locked him so once he's locked
 

67
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,749
i've locked him so once he's locked
so first of all it's it's mass

68
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
so first of all it's it's mass
 

69
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,190
so first of all it's it's mass
he's locked

70
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
he's locked
 

71
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,270
he's locked
then i can move about

72
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
then i can move about
 

73
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,190
then i can move about
and just put it on there and it won't

74
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
and just put it on there and it won't
 

75
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,590
and just put it on there and it won't
move because

76
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
move because
 

77
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,429
move because
he's locked himself without knowing it

78
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
he's locked himself without knowing it
 

79
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,670
he's locked himself without knowing it
so even though you're seeing a physical

80
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
so even though you're seeing a physical
 

81
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,550
so even though you're seeing a physical
push his mind is nowhere

82
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
push his mind is nowhere
 

83
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,749
push his mind is nowhere
to be him

84
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
to be him
 

85
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,270
to be him
to be his own mind

86
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280

 

87
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,630

good

88
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
good
 

89
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,270
good
that's good

90
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
that's good
 

91
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:06,469
that's good
that's good

92
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479

 

93
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,630

so you get feedback

94
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
so you get feedback
 

95
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,190
so you get feedback
and you work trying to work out now

96
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
and you work trying to work out now
 

97
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,949
and you work trying to work out now
how you're getting feedback and what's

98
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
how you're getting feedback and what's
 

99
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,869
how you're getting feedback and what's
happening

100
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
happening
 

101
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,030
happening
well i feel we've got two opposing

102
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
well i feel we've got two opposing
 

103
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,309
well i feel we've got two opposing
angles

104
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
angles
 

105
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,990
angles
yeah so you're you're defying an angle

106
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
yeah so you're you're defying an angle
 

107
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,350
yeah so you're you're defying an angle
but you're actually defining it mentally

108
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
but you're actually defining it mentally
 

109
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,110
but you're actually defining it mentally
without knowing it

110
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
without knowing it
 

111
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,229
without knowing it
because

112
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
because
 

113
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,720
because
you'll know
