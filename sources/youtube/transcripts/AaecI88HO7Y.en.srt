start using this hook but you touch

26
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:44,840
start using this hook but you touch
 

27
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,310
start using this hook but you touch
everything okay so come in she touches

28
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,320
everything okay so come in she touches
 

29
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,270
everything okay so come in she touches
and she's there I want to reach out and

30
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
and she's there I want to reach out and
 

31
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,630
and she's there I want to reach out and
touch her back do you see how I did that

32
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
touch her back do you see how I did that
 

33
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,270
touch her back do you see how I did that
okay that would be better so I'll show

34
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
okay that would be better so I'll show
 

35
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,270
okay that would be better so I'll show
you the

36
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
you the
 

37
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,150
you the
difference go

38
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
difference go
 

39
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,349
difference go
and I'm in here and I'm more getting out

40
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:02,359
and I'm in here and I'm more getting out
 

41
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,070
and I'm in here and I'm more getting out
of the way of you if you pay attention

42
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
of the way of you if you pay attention
 

43
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,070
of the way of you if you pay attention
there's a little bit okay oh we go

44
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080

 

45
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,510

again okay and now there's more contact

46
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
again okay and now there's more contact
 

47
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,350
again okay and now there's more contact
area and so there's

48
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
area and so there's
 

49
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,230
area and so there's
more uh friction which is adhesion

50
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:23,240
more uh friction which is adhesion
 

51
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,550
more uh friction which is adhesion
resistance to you pulling backwards you

52
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
resistance to you pulling backwards you
 

53
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,510
resistance to you pulling backwards you
see okay and so if she has resistance to

54
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
see okay and so if she has resistance to
 

55
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,389
see okay and so if she has resistance to
pulling moppers then I have a very good

56
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:32,399
pulling moppers then I have a very good
 

57
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,510
pulling moppers then I have a very good
structural to bringing her forward okay

58
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
structural to bringing her forward okay
 

59
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,590
structural to bringing her forward okay
so reach up and fill whatever they don't

60
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
so reach up and fill whatever they don't
 

61
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,350
so reach up and fill whatever they don't
okay you see that okay and

62
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
okay you see that okay and
 

63
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,310
okay you see that okay and
then it's not that she's still trying to

64
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320
then it's not that she's still trying to
 

65
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,789
then it's not that she's still trying to
do spinal displacement right cuz we

66
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:49,799
do spinal displacement right cuz we
 

67
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,709
do spinal displacement right cuz we
would be hanging out here in the drill

68
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:51,719
would be hanging out here in the drill
 

69
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,350
would be hanging out here in the drill
but now I move the drill by Just sh

70
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
but now I move the drill by Just sh
 

71
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,469
but now I move the drill by Just sh
simply shifting my weight without

72
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
simply shifting my weight without
 

73
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,630
simply shifting my weight without
changing the pressure okay

74
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
changing the pressure okay
 

75
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,069
changing the pressure okay
so maybe there was some

76
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,079
so maybe there was some
 

77
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,149
so maybe there was some
confusion is that you were only supposed

78
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
confusion is that you were only supposed
 

79
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,389
confusion is that you were only supposed
to feel my

80
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
to feel my
 

81
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,630
to feel my
feet and

82
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640

not
 

85
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,910
not
push got it okay so let's make sure the

86
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
push got it okay so let's make sure the
 

87
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,670
push got it okay so let's make sure the
UK feels my feet there we are okay and

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:18,680
UK feels my feet there we are okay and
 

89
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,630
UK feels my feet there we are okay and

in this case because we're going to move
 

93
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,350
in this case because we're going to move
to the back foot so she's she's actually

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:44,920
okay so uh I keep the pressure that I
 

141
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,910
okay so uh I keep the pressure that I
feel here and then that pressure that

142
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
feel here and then that pressure that
 

143
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,670
feel here and then that pressure that
pressure moves and you're you're going

144
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,680
pressure moves and you're you're going
 

145
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,390
pressure moves and you're you're going
to feel that because you're not spinally

146
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,400
to feel that because you're not spinally
 

147
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,990
to feel that because you're not spinally
displacing okay and I'm trying to move

148
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,000
displacing okay and I'm trying to move
 

149
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,789
displacing okay and I'm trying to move
it the pressure at the hands will

150
00:03:59,789 --> 00:03:59,799
it the pressure at the hands will
 

151
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,470
it the pressure at the hands will
slightly increased do do you get that so

152
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
slightly increased do do you get that so
 

153
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,589
slightly increased do do you get that so
watch as I I'm here Mark that as zero

154
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
watch as I I'm here Mark that as zero
 

155
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,789
watch as I I'm here Mark that as zero
feel more more more okay more more if we

156
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
feel more more more okay more more if we
 

157
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,069
feel more more more okay more more if we
go now that's me moving towards my rear

158

that when I went with you when I went
 

181
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,830
that when I went with you when I went
with you you had to take a step because

182
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
with you you had to take a step because
 

183
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,270
with you you had to take a step because
even in the in the range of motion of

184
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
even in the in the range of motion of
 

185
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,870
even in the in the range of motion of
the boat rowing

186
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:57,880
the boat rowing
 

187
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,830
the boat rowing
exercise if your feet stay still as they

exercise if your feet stay still as they
 

189
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,430
exercise if your feet stay still as they
are in this drill your line of gravity

190
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
are in this drill your line of gravity
 

191
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,310
are in this drill your line of gravity
will fall outside your base of support

192
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,320
will fall outside your base of support
 

193
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,430
will fall outside your base of support
and you would have to step in order to

194
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
and you would have to step in order to
 

195
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,469
and you would have to step in order to
not hit your face okay so when you guys

196
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:11,479
not hit your face okay so when you guys
 

197
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,710
not hit your face okay so when you guys
did

198
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:13,720
did
 

199
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,749
did
it you're

200
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:16,759
it you're
 

201
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,749
it you're
like this and you're never going to step

202
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
like this and you're never going to step
 

203
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,670
like this and you're never going to step
or you feel that and you go like

204
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
or you feel that and you go like
 

205
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,029
or you feel that and you go like
here so my my arms came forward do you

206
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
here so my my arms came forward do you
 

207
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,909
here so my my arms came forward do you
see so I feel it and you'll see my feet

208
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
see so I feel it and you'll see my feet
 

209
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,950
see so I feel it and you'll see my feet
are fairly close together I'll make them

210
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
are fairly close together I'll make them
 

211
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,550
are fairly close together I'll make them
fairly close together but it it'll be

212
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:35,560
fairly close together but it it'll be
 

213
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,710
fairly close together but it it'll be
enough there's the increase in pressure

214
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:37,720
enough there's the increase in pressure
 

215
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,670
enough there's the increase in pressure
increase in pressure increase in

216
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
increase in pressure increase in
 

217
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,029
increase in pressure increase in
pressure you see and because the center

218
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:42,039
pressure you see and because the center
 

219
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,830
pressure you see and because the center
moves right

220
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
moves right
 

221
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,189
moves right
away you're going to have to take that

222
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199
away you're going to have to take that
 

223
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,309
away you're going to have to take that
step okay all right so I'm not getting

224
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:49,319
step okay all right so I'm not getting
 

225
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,150
step okay all right so I'm not getting
out of the way the pressure should

226
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
out of the way the pressure should
 

227
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,550
out of the way the pressure should
actually increase okay uh but if you go

228
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,560
actually increase okay uh but if you go
 

229
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,150
actually increase okay uh but if you go
too y right right and then I'm out there

230
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,160
too y right right and then I'm out there
 

231
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,950
too y right right and then I'm out there
was a slip did you feel the slip okay

232

237
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,629
you're feeling you went to Yin which is
I'm going to get out of the way let's

238
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:11,639
I'm going to get out of the way let's
 

239
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,150
I'm going to get out of the way let's
not get out of the way okay all right

240
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
not get out of the way okay all right
 

241
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:38,070
not get out of the way okay all right
try

242
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080

 

243
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,150

okay so we go okay and uh I want you to

in the Palm is where the Palm is where I

254
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
in the Palm is where the Palm is where I
 

255
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,550
in the Palm is where the Palm is where I
am the palm right there okay I can't

256
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
am the palm right there okay I can't
 

257
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,230
am the palm right there okay I can't
make any more contact with that cuz the

258
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
make any more contact with that cuz the
 

259
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,510
make any more contact with that cuz the
way you grip with your T-Rex arms but

260
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,520
way you grip with your T-Rex arms but
 

261
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,270
way you grip with your T-Rex arms but
it's fine for I don't care okay all

262
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
it's fine for I don't care okay all
 

263
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,230
it's fine for I don't care okay all
right uh and now if I uh go

264
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
right uh and now if I uh go
 

265
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,990
right uh and now if I uh go
light you see how it goes off and then

266
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,000
light you see how it goes off and then
 

267
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,510
light you see how it goes off and then
there's the slippage you just just ever

268
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
there's the slippage you just just ever
 

269
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,110
there's the slippage you just just ever
so slight but when you go fast it's gone

270
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,120
so slight but when you go fast it's gone
 

271
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,790
so slight but when you go fast it's gone
okay all right so there we are

272
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:27,800
okay all right so there we are
 

273
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,830
okay all right so there we are
okay there more I feel your feet I don't

274
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:30,840
okay there more I feel your feet I don't
 

275
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,990
okay there more I feel your feet I don't
think you feel my feet there you go okay

276
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,000
think you feel my feet there you go okay
 

277
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,710
think you feel my feet there you go okay
all right and then here's going to be

278
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
all right and then here's going to be
 

279
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,510
all right and then here's going to be
and again once you feel my feet I don't

280
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
and again once you feel my feet I don't
 

281
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,869
and again once you feel my feet I don't
want you to finally displace you're just

282
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:42,879
want you to finally displace you're just
 

283
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,990
want you to finally displace you're just
hanging out there okay all right and

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
hanging out there okay all right and
 

285
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,710
hanging out there okay all right and
then I don't want to go so hard cuz this

286
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
then I don't want to go so hard cuz this
 

287
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,270
then I don't want to go so hard cuz this
might not seem like I'm slipping but

288
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
might not seem like I'm slipping but
 

289
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,070
might not seem like I'm slipping but

feet without the final displacement
 

297
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,510
feet without the final displacement
there we go okay um and now what I'm

298

going to do if I do all this right I
 

301
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,830
going to do if I do all this right I
don't move your

articulation to happen okay
such that for

314
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:31,880
such that for

example if you uh try to extend your
hands which would require you to extend

318

hands which would require you to extend
 

319
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,949
hands which would require you to extend
your elbows you see you can't and if you

try to uh roll your shoulders back
you're going to go like this you got it

324
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:46,680
you're going to go like this you got it
 

325
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,550
you're going to go like this you got it
okay you roll your shoulders back oh

326
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:49,560
okay you roll your shoulders back oh
 

327
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,750
okay you roll your shoulders back oh
crap you see okay now what we want and

328
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:52,760
crap you see okay now what we want and
 

329
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,910
crap you see okay now what we want and
so now when I get into this position

330
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
so now when I get into this position
 

331
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,829
so now when I get into this position
then the center is going to keep moving

332
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:58,839
then the center is going to keep moving
 

333
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,350
then the center is going to keep moving
right away

334
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,360
right away
 

335
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,069
right away
right away you see okay not not any

336
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:04,079
right away you see okay not not any
 

337
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,470
right away you see okay not not any
slack up in the arms up in the shoulders

338
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,480
slack up in the arms up in the shoulders
 

339
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,069
slack up in the arms up in the shoulders
you see how our shoulders go first okay

340
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:10,079
you see how our shoulders go first okay
 

341
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,630
you see how our shoulders go first okay
all that I'm I'm starting to move this

342
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
all that I'm I'm starting to move this
 

343
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,910
all that I'm I'm starting to move this
so another way we might as well go there

344
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
so another way we might as well go there
 

345
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,790
so another way we might as well go there
is we'll go this

346
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:19,800

 

347
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,550

way

348
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560
way
 

349
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,790
way
okay so again

350
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,800
okay so again
 

351
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,470
okay so again
different

352
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
different
 

353
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,829
different
shoulder elbow

354
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839

 

355
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,829

okay

356
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
okay
 

357
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,110
okay
oh here again try to pull your hand back

358
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
oh here again try to pull your hand back
 

359
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,389
oh here again try to pull your hand back
and the elbow can't try to push it

360
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:39,399
and the elbow can't try to push it
 

361
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,870
and the elbow can't try to push it
forward and the elbow can't can you see

362
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:41,880
forward and the elbow can't can you see
 

363
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,790
forward and the elbow can't can you see
try to move it out try to move your arm

364
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:43,800
try to move it out try to move your arm
 

365
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,710
try to move it out try to move your arm
out and you can't okay and so once I

366
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
out and you can't okay and so once I
 

367
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,870
out and you can't okay and so once I
have here that's that's what I move the

368
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
have here that's that's what I move the
 

369
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,509
have here that's that's what I move the
I move the center the center comes up

370
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
I move the center the center comes up
 

371
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,630
I move the center the center comes up
okay forcing them in this case he you

372
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
okay forcing them in this case he you
 

373
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,389
okay forcing them in this case he you
better put your line of gravity you

374
00:09:59,389 --> 00:09:59,399
better put your line of gravity you
 

375
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,910
better put your line of gravity you
better put your Bas of support back

376
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:00,920
better put your Bas of support back
 

377
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,550
better put your Bas of support back
underneath so I'm here feel that and I

378
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
underneath so I'm here feel that and I
 

379
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,590
underneath so I'm here feel that and I
move

380
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,600
move
 

381
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,230
move
that okay you kind of course go the

382
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
that okay you kind of course go the
 

383
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,550
that okay you kind of course go the
other way does it

384
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560

 

385
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,990

matter okay let's try that

386
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,000
matter okay let's try that
 

387
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,750
matter okay let's try that
one um okay and I I again the external

388
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
one um okay and I I again the external
 

389
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,310
one um okay and I I again the external
you do use it we use it okay um but

390
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:25,320
you do use it we use it okay um but
 

391
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,150
you do use it we use it okay um but
that's not in this drill we're not doing

392
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,160
that's not in this drill we're not doing
 

393
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,550
that's not in this drill we're not doing
it in this drill okay so for for

394
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
it in this drill okay so for for
 

395
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,110
it in this drill okay so for for
example in in our kazushi patterns I do

396
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,120
example in in our kazushi patterns I do
 

397
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,470
example in in our kazushi patterns I do
want your spine to tilt okay and uh that

398
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:39,480
want your spine to tilt okay and uh that
 

399
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,269
want your spine to tilt okay and uh that
means that I'm going to lean you one way

400
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:42,279
means that I'm going to lean you one way
 

401
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,949
means that I'm going to lean you one way
or another I'm going to lean you okay um

402
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
or another I'm going to lean you okay um
 

403
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,150
or another I'm going to lean you okay um
and that does generate a line of gravity

404
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,160
and that does generate a line of gravity
 

405
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,949
and that does generate a line of gravity
moving outside the base of support but

406
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:51,959
moving outside the base of support but
 

407
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,550
moving outside the base of support but
unlike bad iido or or even you know bad

408
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
unlike bad iido or or even you know bad
 

409
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,509

any of the bad grappling Arts

410
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
any of the bad grappling Arts
 

411
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,949
any of the bad grappling Arts
I have to

412
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
I have to
 

413
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,590
I have to
also make your tonden your Center this

414
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
also make your tonden your Center this
 

415
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,350
also make your tonden your Center this
let's just not the tonden your

416
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
let's just not the tonden your
 

417
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,550
let's just not the tonden your
center of gravity I have to also have it

418
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:09,560
center of gravity I have to also have it
 

419
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,550
center of gravity I have to also have it
traversed through the satal plane in in

420
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
traversed through the satal plane in in
 

421
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,870
traversed through the satal plane in in
Iko that's why you have a a spiraling uh

422
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:15,880
Iko that's why you have a a spiraling uh
 

423
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,590
Iko that's why you have a a spiraling uh
rotating of the UK's body across the mat

424
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
rotating of the UK's body across the mat
 

425
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,870
rotating of the UK's body across the mat
okay so um in this drill we're just

426
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
okay so um in this drill we're just
 

427
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,350
okay so um in this drill we're just
working on that that the center is

428
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,360
working on that that the center is
 

429
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,990
working on that that the center is
traversing through the sagittal plane

430
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,000
traversing through the sagittal plane
 

431
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,670
traversing through the sagittal plane
and not tilting you and then eventually

432
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:32,680
and not tilting you and then eventually
 

433
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,550
and not tilting you and then eventually
because you had to move the center

434
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:35,560
because you had to move the center
 

435
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,389
because you had to move the center
traversed okay so uh not

436
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:39,399
traversed okay so uh not
 

437
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,710
traversed okay so uh not
intentional in the last

438
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:41,720
intentional in the last
 

439
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,430
intentional in the last
filming um but you can go back and look

440
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
filming um but you can go back and look
 

441
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,670
filming um but you can go back and look
at

442
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,680
at
 

443
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,829
at
Virginia's

444
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839

 

445
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,750

um left

446
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
um left
 

447
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,389
um left
shoulder and you not going to see that

448
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
shoulder and you not going to see that
 

449
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,670
shoulder and you not going to see that
it's dropping and lowering in relation

450
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
it's dropping and lowering in relation
 

451
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,069
it's dropping and lowering in relation
to the right one and and then eventually

452
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
to the right one and and then eventually
 

453
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,870
to the right one and and then eventually
they step and regain their base um since

454
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
they step and regain their base um since
 

455
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,910
they step and regain their base um since
it wasn't intentional to show uh we

456
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
it wasn't intentional to show uh we
 

457
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,190
it wasn't intentional to show uh we
found that if you look at this shoulder

458
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,200
found that if you look at this shoulder
 

459
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,350
found that if you look at this shoulder
near the camera uh you would see that it

460
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
near the camera uh you would see that it
 

461
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,030
near the camera uh you would see that it
did not go up which would be indicative

462
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,040
did not go up which would be indicative
 

463
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,990
did not go up which would be indicative
of this shoulder going down okay so in

464
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,000
of this shoulder going down okay so in
 

465
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,150
of this shoulder going down okay so in
other words I'm not here she touches I'm

466
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,160
other words I'm not here she touches I'm
 

467
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,710
other words I'm not here she touches I'm
not trying to go like this and then she

468
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
not trying to go like this and then she
 

469
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,030
not trying to go like this and then she
fell out okay I'm not trying to do that

470
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,040
fell out okay I'm not trying to do that
 

471
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,069
fell out okay I'm not trying to do that
in this drill uh I make those

472
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
in this drill uh I make those
 

473
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,470
in this drill uh I make those
connections okay and then I'm I'm moving

474
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:37,480
connections okay and then I'm I'm moving
 

475
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,150
connections okay and then I'm I'm moving
this thing the center here so if you

476
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
this thing the center here so if you
 

477
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,189
this thing the center here so if you
watch her

478
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:41,199
watch her
 

479
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,629
watch her
shoulders uh I'm not going to make them

480
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:45,639
shoulders uh I'm not going to make them
 

481
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,189
shoulders uh I'm not going to make them
go

482
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:47,199
go
 

483
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:57,269
go
here okay they're just moving

484
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279

 

485
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,949

across feel my feet I see what you're

486
00:12:59,949 --> 00:12:59,959
across feel my feet I see what you're
