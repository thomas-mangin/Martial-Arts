1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,789

all right uh I've been the techniques a

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
all right uh I've been the techniques a
 

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,629
all right uh I've been the techniques a
little different and it kind of helps

4
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
little different and it kind of helps
 

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,629
little different and it kind of helps
but uh the fall is definitely

6
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:11,639
but uh the fall is definitely
 

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,070
but uh the fall is definitely
challenging as you can see Myas in the

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,080
challenging as you can see Myas in the
 

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,109
challenging as you can see Myas in the
video Tristan when he was little and

10
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:18,119
video Tristan when he was little and
 

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,509
video Tristan when he was little and
Leah who's a very small uh person

12
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:22,519
Leah who's a very small uh person
 

13
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,349
Leah who's a very small uh person
lightweight um but they're able to do it

14
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
lightweight um but they're able to do it
 

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,269
lightweight um but they're able to do it
and the the the difficulty

16
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:28,279
and the the the difficulty
 

17
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,069
and the the the difficulty
is uh can they keep their Center so that

18
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
is uh can they keep their Center so that
 

19
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,110
is uh can they keep their Center so that
they don't uh segment into the fall if

20
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
they don't uh segment into the fall if
 

21
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,709
they don't uh segment into the fall if
they segment into the fall the head is

22
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:37,719
they segment into the fall the head is
 

23
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,069
they segment into the fall the head is
sure to hit the mat okay that's that's

24
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:41,079
sure to hit the mat okay that's that's
 

25
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,549
sure to hit the mat okay that's that's
really the dangerous part but there's

26
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:43,559
really the dangerous part but there's
 

27
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,590
really the dangerous part but there's
some things that help they're a little

28
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
some things that help they're a little
 

29
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,189
some things that help they're a little
different even in my Desi it's very hard

30
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:49,199
different even in my Desi it's very hard
 

31
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,029
different even in my Desi it's very hard
for them to understand because the

32
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
for them to understand because the
 

33
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,670
for them to understand because the
obvious

34
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:54,680
obvious
 

35
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,830
obvious
appearance is more easily graspable and

36
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:58,840
appearance is more easily graspable and
 

37
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,430
appearance is more easily graspable and
then EX executable but not really okay

38
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:02,440
then EX executable but not really okay
 

39
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,270
then EX executable but not really okay
so uh as he comes along uh the first

40
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,280
so uh as he comes along uh the first
 

41
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,590
so uh as he comes along uh the first
thing to realize that you're doing is

42
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:08,600
thing to realize that you're doing is
 

43
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,749
thing to realize that you're doing is
not moving his arm like

44
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:11,759
not moving his arm like
 

45
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,950
not moving his arm like
this so you're you're not uh just taking

46
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:15,960
this so you're you're not uh just taking
 

47
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,550
this so you're you're not uh just taking
away the obstacle and he goes up because

48
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
away the obstacle and he goes up because
 

49
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,870
away the obstacle and he goes up because
then he would do exactly what your Desi

50
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
then he would do exactly what your Desi
 

51
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,830
then he would do exactly what your Desi
are doing okay this one's a little

52
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840

 

53
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,670

different so this one I'm working on

54
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:28,680
different so this one I'm working on
 

55
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,069
different so this one I'm working on
inward spiral so so here I have an

56
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
inward spiral so so here I have an
 

57
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,789
inward spiral so so here I have an
inward spiral this way okay so this

58
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:33,799
inward spiral this way okay so this
 

59
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,950
inward spiral this way okay so this
inward spiral is going this way and then

60
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
inward spiral is going this way and then
 

61
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,789
inward spiral is going this way and then
I'm going around it and I'm going to do

62
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:39,799
I'm going around it and I'm going to do
 

63
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,510
I'm going around it and I'm going to do
another inward spiral so it looks like

64
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
another inward spiral so it looks like
 

65
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,990
another inward spiral so it looks like
I'm going like

66
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going like
 

67
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,030
I'm going like
this but I'm I'm not which you can tell

68
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,040
this but I'm I'm not which you can tell
 

69
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,350
this but I'm I'm not which you can tell
by how they fall

70
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,360
by how they fall
 

71
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,749
by how they fall
okay uh so the first thing is inward

72
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
okay uh so the first thing is inward
 

73
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,630
okay uh so the first thing is inward
spiral like this IM spiral around it and

74
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
spiral like this IM spiral around it and
 

75
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,630
spiral like this IM spiral around it and
here's your other spiral and I do

76
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
here's your other spiral and I do
 

77
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,950
here's your other spiral and I do
another inward spiral here so I don't

78
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
another inward spiral here so I don't
 

79
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,950
another inward spiral here so I don't
want to pull in

80
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
want to pull in
 

81
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,350
want to pull in
backwards and I don't want to just push

82
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
backwards and I don't want to just push
 

83
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,350
backwards and I don't want to just push
with two stiff

84
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360

 

85
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,350

hands inward spiral two inward spirals

86
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
hands inward spiral two inward spirals
 

87
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,830
hands inward spiral two inward spirals
are going like this and I drop my center

88
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
are going like this and I drop my center
 

89
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,110
are going like this and I drop my center
and I just keep spiraling dropping my

90
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
and I just keep spiraling dropping my
 

91
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,430
and I just keep spiraling dropping my
center and I move my base out of the way

92
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
center and I move my base out of the way
 

93
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,309
center and I move my base out of the way
so I can stay with his Center so my

94
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
so I can stay with his Center so my
 

95
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,990
so I can stay with his Center so my
hands are doing this with my center

96
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,000
hands are doing this with my center
 

97
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,190
hands are doing this with my center
dropping and then I get out of the way

98
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
dropping and then I get out of the way
 

99
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,869
dropping and then I get out of the way
so I can stay over

100
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:39,879
so I can stay over
 

101
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,030
so I can stay over
him so even if I don't go fast I don't

102
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,040
him so even if I don't go fast I don't
 

103
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,430
him so even if I don't go fast I don't
do the jumping variant I don't have to

104
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
do the jumping variant I don't have to
 

105
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,509
do the jumping variant I don't have to
kill my

106
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:54,519

 

107
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,149

UK inward spiral not just get out of the

108
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
UK inward spiral not just get out of the
 

109
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,750
UK inward spiral not just get out of the
way inward spiral spiral turn around it

110
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
way inward spiral spiral turn around it
 

111
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,589
way inward spiral spiral turn around it
boom two inward spirals dropping my

112
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:04,599
boom two inward spirals dropping my
 

113
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:28,670
boom two inward spirals dropping my
Center keep

114
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680

 

115
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,190

spiraling

116
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,200

 

117
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,710

don't push on here just keep spiraling

118
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
don't push on here just keep spiraling
 

119
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:48,149
don't push on here just keep spiraling
you'll touch what you touch but you keep

120
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159

 

121
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,509

spiraling and I was doing me you're

122
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
spiraling and I was doing me you're
 

123
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,270
spiraling and I was doing me you're
doing your sheto T it should be the same

124
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
doing your sheto T it should be the same
 

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,030
doing your sheto T it should be the same
only that this is where you would turn

126
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,040
only that this is where you would turn
 

127
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,309
only that this is where you would turn
around it here

128
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:01,319
around it here
 

129
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,470
around it here
so you still doing the in spiral shift

130
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
so you still doing the in spiral shift
 

131
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,030
so you still doing the in spiral shift
away turn around it iner behind him and

132
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
away turn around it iner behind him and
 

133
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,350
away turn around it iner behind him and
then two

134
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,360

 

135
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:28,590

spirals two spirals keep

136
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600

 

137
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,749

turning

138
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759

 

139
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,469

no no no no no turn your inward spiral

140
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
no no no no no turn your inward spiral
 

141
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,390
no no no no no turn your inward spiral
don't just pass the arm so go back and

142
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,400
don't just pass the arm so go back and
 

143
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,110
don't just pass the arm so go back and
let's watch something okay pull the arm

144
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
let's watch something okay pull the arm
 

145
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,150
let's watch something okay pull the arm
straight down without the spiral yeah

146
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
straight down without the spiral yeah
 

147
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,990
straight down without the spiral yeah
there you go okay and uh go slow so you

148
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
there you go okay and uh go slow so you
 

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,990
there you go okay and uh go slow so you
could see what's happening to

150
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
could see what's happening to
 

151
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,469
could see what's happening to
him go slow pull it okay so he's kind of

152
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
him go slow pull it okay so he's kind of
 

153
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,270
him go slow pull it okay so he's kind of
in a straight line and he kind of leans

154
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
in a straight line and he kind of leans
 

155
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,189
in a straight line and he kind of leans
over just cuz you're pulling his hands

156
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
over just cuz you're pulling his hands
 

157
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,790
over just cuz you're pulling his hands
which your pulling his shoulders do you

158
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
which your pulling his shoulders do you
 

159
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,830
which your pulling his shoulders do you
see that do it one more

160
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
see that do it one more
 

161
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,710
see that do it one more
time good okay and now do the inward

162
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:07,720
time good okay and now do the inward
 

163
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,230
time good okay and now do the inward
spiral

164
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,240
spiral
 

165
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,550
spiral
instead yes okay and you can turn that

166
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560

okay okay so if I leave him where he
 

273
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,110
okay okay so if I leave him where he
is then this technique makes no sense

that don't leave him there there and
 

299
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,110
that don't leave him there there and
then you go

300
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
then you go
 

301
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,430
then you go
around get his hips

302
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,440

because you're going to stand them back

308
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:43,159
because you're going to stand them back
 

309
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,070
because you're going to stand them back
up I want you to picture there's like a

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,240
ball here and I'm going to be on the
 

313
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,790
ball here and I'm going to be on the
outermost surface of the ball pressing

314
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
outermost surface of the ball pressing
 

315
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,190
outermost surface of the ball pressing
down but not so down that his hips can't

316
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200
down but not so down that his hips can't
 

317
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,430
down but not so down that his hips can't
go forward you have to feel for that

318
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
go forward you have to feel for that
 

319
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,310
go forward you have to feel for that
okay you're coming around so don't go

320
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
okay you're coming around so don't go
 

321
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,389
okay you're coming around so don't go
all the way

322
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:07,399

 

323
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,350

off so I go around so that his hips go

324
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,360
off so I go around so that his hips go
 

325
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,590

forward and then you feel like there's a

326
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:12,600
forward and then you feel like there's a
 

327
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,230
forward and then you feel like there's a
downward this you see okay but if I go

328
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240
downward this you see okay but if I go
 

329
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,190
downward this you see okay but if I go

too far down and I'll push your hips
 

331
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,990
too far down and I'll push your hips
back got it and if I come all the way up

332
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
back got it and if I come all the way up
 

333
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,630
back got it and if I come all the way up
you'll be able to stand

334
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:21,640
you'll be able to stand
 

335
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,069
you'll be able to stand
up so you're going to

336
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:24,079
up so you're going to
 

337
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,829
up so you're going to
feel this brings his hips forward and

338
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:26,839
feel this brings his hips forward and
 

339
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,630
feel this brings his hips forward and
there's the ball do you see do you feel

340
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
there's the ball do you see do you feel
 

341
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,030
there's the ball do you see do you feel
that okay but I'm still letting your

342
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
that okay but I'm still letting your
 

343
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,949
that okay but I'm still letting your
hips go forward got it so for example

344
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:33,959
hips go forward got it so for example
 

345
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,030
hips go forward got it so for example
just walk your hips forward and you see

346
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,040
just walk your hips forward and you see
 

347
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,150
just walk your hips forward and you see
you can do it come back as opposed

348
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
you can do it come back as opposed
 

349
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,949
you can do it come back as opposed
to I'm pushing down walk your hips

350
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:41,959
to I'm pushing down walk your hips
 

351
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,630
to I'm pushing down walk your hips
forward you see I'm locking them do you

352
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
forward you see I'm locking them do you
 

353
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,910
forward you see I'm locking them do you
get that okay so there is already a

354
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
get that okay so there is already a
 

355
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,470
get that okay so there is already a
downward this but not enough to stop

356
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,480
downward this but not enough to stop
 

357
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,190
downward this but not enough to stop
your hips from going forward and now

358
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,200
your hips from going forward and now
 

359
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,269
your hips from going forward and now
you'll have this angle do you get

360
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
you'll have this angle do you get
 

361
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,310
you'll have this angle do you get
it okay and now don't push with your

362
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
it okay and now don't push with your
 

363
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,829
it okay and now don't push with your
forearms don't push with your forearms

364
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
forearms don't push with your forearms
 

365
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,470
forearms don't push with your forearms
you just keep turning these you just

them and whatever's touching him is
 

371
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,590
them and whatever's touching him is
going to push on him but I don't change

going to push on him but I don't change
 

373
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,590
going to push on him but I don't change
the

374

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
move and I'm already pushing on you do
 

379
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,949
move and I'm already pushing on you do
you feel that but not enough to stop you

380
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:23,959
you feel that but not enough to stop you
 

381
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,350
you feel that but not enough to stop you
now I got that tilt this hand comes over

382
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
now I got that tilt this hand comes over
 

383
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,190
now I got that tilt this hand comes over
the top I'm grounding on the back foot

384
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,200
the top I'm grounding on the back foot
 

385
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,990
the top I'm grounding on the back foot
and I just

386
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000

 

387
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,030

spiral then so he does not fall on me

388
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,040
spiral then so he does not fall on me
 

389
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,550
spiral then so he does not fall on me
but more importantly so that I can press

390
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:39,560
but more importantly so that I can press
 

391
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,990
but more importantly so that I can press
on his main

392
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
on his main
 

393
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,310
on his main
Mass I have to move to stay up with him

394
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:45,320
Mass I have to move to stay up with him
 

395
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,190
Mass I have to move to stay up with him
but I'm still going here so there's a

396
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
but I'm still going here so there's a
 

397
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,790
but I'm still going here so there's a
kind of forward do you feel that

398
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
kind of forward do you feel that
 

399
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,350
kind of forward do you feel that
forwardness do you see it's going this

400
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
forwardness do you see it's going this
 

401
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,069
forwardness do you see it's going this
way and now to stay with your Moss I

402
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
way and now to stay with your Moss I
 

403
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,030
way and now to stay with your Moss I
move my

404
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040

 

405
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,950

foot this is

406
00:10:59,950 --> 00:10:59,960
foot this is
 

407
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,990
foot this is
[Music]

408
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,000

 

409
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,190

different and this is

410
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200

 

411
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,870

different get his hips moving start to

412
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:15,880
different get his hips moving start to
 

413
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,710
different get his hips moving start to
press down you're already pressing down

414
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:17,720
press down you're already pressing down
 

415
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,310
press down you're already pressing down
you feel it but I don't I keep it so

416
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
you feel it but I don't I keep it so
 

417
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,949
you feel it but I don't I keep it so
that you keep moving inward

418
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959

 

419
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,949

spiral

420
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:31,959

 

421
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:41,269

okay let's try

422
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279

 

423
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:49,310

it and again same

424
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320

 

425
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,629

side okay so here's what the the throw

426
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:53,639
side okay so here's what the the throw
 

427
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,150
side okay so here's what the the throw
is counterintuitive and so right now

428
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
is counterintuitive and so right now
 

429
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,310
is counterintuitive and so right now
your arm is keeping them up kind of

430
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
your arm is keeping them up kind of
 

431
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,389
your arm is keeping them up kind of
press again and your back arm so now for

432
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
press again and your back arm so now for
 

433
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,150
press again and your back arm so now for
you to throw him what makes sense is

434
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
you to throw him what makes sense is
 

435
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,750
you to throw him what makes sense is
that you'll just pull him backwards

436
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
that you'll just pull him backwards
 

437
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,350
that you'll just pull him backwards
right go

438
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:08,360
right go
 

439
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,269
right go
ahead okay so

440
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:12,279
ahead okay so
 

441
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,389
ahead okay so
uh why inward spirals again remember

442
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:15,399
uh why inward spirals again remember
 

443
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,350
uh why inward spirals again remember
this is the embryonic version because I

444
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
this is the embryonic version because I
 

445
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,629
this is the embryonic version because I
showed you the dynamic version where

446
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
showed you the dynamic version where
 

447
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,350
showed you the dynamic version where
it's really a jumping throw okay but

448
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
it's really a jumping throw okay but
 

449
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,590
it's really a jumping throw okay but
it's not like

450
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
it's not like
 

451
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,870
it's not like
um I'm sorry I can't remember his name

452
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
um I'm sorry I can't remember his name
 

453
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,750
um I'm sorry I can't remember his name
shawa just over here and grabbing okay

454
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
shawa just over here and grabbing okay
 

455
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,269
shawa just over here and grabbing okay
that's going to be a young young class

456
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:34,279
that's going to be a young young class
 

457
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,870
that's going to be a young young class
cuz he's going that way okay we are

458
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
cuz he's going that way okay we are
 

459
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,629
cuz he's going that way okay we are
going to turn his energy so everything

460
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
going to turn his energy so everything
 

461
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,870
going to turn his energy so everything
is going to be the same and we're just

462
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
is going to be the same and we're just
 

463
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,949
is going to be the same and we're just
going to look at this arm okay so let's

464
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
going to look at this arm okay so let's
 

465
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,110
going to look at this arm okay so let's
turn this

466
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
turn this
 

467
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,509
turn this
way and right now my elbow my upper arm

468
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
way and right now my elbow my upper arm
 

469
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,509
way and right now my elbow my upper arm
right here is keeping him from going

470
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:54,519
right here is keeping him from going
 

471
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,389
right here is keeping him from going
down the more I push down with my hand

472
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:57,399
down the more I push down with my hand
 

473
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,710
down the more I push down with my hand
the more I'm just going to make his chin

474
00:12:59,710 --> 00:12:59,720
the more I'm just going to make his chin
 

475
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,590
the more I'm just going to make his chin
go forward and so that's why Mak sense

476
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:02,600
go forward and so that's why Mak sense
 

477
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,110
go forward and so that's why Mak sense
to pull him okay but what tends to

478
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,120
to pull him okay but what tends to
 

479
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,069
to pull him okay but what tends to
happen when you pull him is they'll turn

480
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
happen when you pull him is they'll turn
 

481
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,430
happen when you pull him is they'll turn
out of it he'll turn out of it that's

482
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
out of it he'll turn out of it that's
 

483
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,230
out of it he'll turn out of it that's
not it so we'll just do it on one hand

484
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
not it so we'll just do it on one hand
 

485
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,670
not it so we'll just do it on one hand
so you can see

486
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:18,680
so you can see
 

487
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,590
so you can see
move okay and this hand is going to do

488
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:22,600
move okay and this hand is going to do
 

489
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,310
move okay and this hand is going to do
an in

490
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
an in
 

491
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,069
an in
spiral it's going to do

492
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:27,079
spiral it's going to do
 

493
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,750
spiral it's going to do
this and when it does it the elbow's
