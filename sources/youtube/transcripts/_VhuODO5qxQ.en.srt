falls into zero
 

27
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,310
falls into zero
pressure okay so here's zero

28

we'll go back get the pr there's the
 

45
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,510
we'll go back get the pr there's the
pressure again right and my step changes

46
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:10,520
pressure again right and my step changes
 

47
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,789
pressure again right and my step changes
it you

48
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
it you
 

49
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,070

and in his case projectable
 

65
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,590
and in his case projectable
okay so here oh zero pressure he falls

66
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
okay so here oh zero pressure he falls
 

67
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,069
okay so here oh zero pressure he falls
into the

00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
into the
 

69
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,709
into the
void zero pressure and once you get zero

70
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:47,719
void zero pressure and once you get zero
 

71
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,990
void zero pressure and once you get zero
pressure then you stick you stick on him

72
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
pressure then you stick you stick on him
 

73
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,310

he's going to get out of it really

254
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,000
he's going to get out of it really

Yong values they do have to equal right

258
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
Yong values they do have to equal right
 

259
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,230
Yong values they do have to equal right
but they should be

260
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
but they should be
 

261
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,750
but they should be
higher and it'll give him less chance to

262
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,760
higher and it'll give him less chance to
 

263
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,190
higher and it'll give him less chance to
um to counter it so going using that

264
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
um to counter it so going using that
 

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,310

341
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,949
that pressure push there it is that
pressure had I been able to step out you

342
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
pressure had I been able to step out you
 

343
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,470
pressure had I been able to step out you
see it

344
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
see it
 

345
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,550
see it
neutralize or take the pressure right

346
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:19,560
neutralize or take the pressure right
 

347
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,590
neutralize or take the pressure right
and I go this way and then that way I

348
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
and I go this way and then that way I
 

349
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,990
and I go this way and then that way I
I'm changing it with my steps my

350
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm changing it with my steps my
 

351
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,949
I'm changing it with my steps my
rotations the right foot the left foot

352
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
rotations the right foot the left foot
 

353
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,829
rotations the right foot the left foot
okay same exact

354
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
okay same exact
 

355
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,269
okay same exact
way as I go

356
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:32,279
way as I go
 

357
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,790
way as I go
here don't have a universal technique

358
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:35,800
here don't have a universal technique
 

359
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,910
here don't have a universal technique
here okay so I increase the Y value

360
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
here okay so I increase the Y value
 

361
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,430
here okay so I increase the Y value
internalizing it you see and then I

362
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
internalizing it you see and then I
 

363
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,470
internalizing it you see and then I
decide what will work within this okay

364
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:47,480
decide what will work within this okay
 

365
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,389
decide what will work within this okay
don't have one that has the same thing

366
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
don't have one that has the same thing
 

367
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,710
don't have one that has the same thing
every time your arm is so low that I'm

368
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:53,720
every time your arm is so low that I'm
 

369
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,150
every time your arm is so low that I'm
using muscle to pick that up you see so

370
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,160
using muscle to pick that up you see so
 

371
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,910
using muscle to pick that up you see so
as I go I drive here

372
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
as I go I drive here
 

373
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,230
as I go I drive here
you see that difference yes and so I

374
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
you see that difference yes and so I
 

375
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,069
you see that difference yes and so I
don't I don't maybe get you to flip over

376
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
don't I don't maybe get you to flip over
 

377
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,670
don't I don't maybe get you to flip over
but I

378
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
but I
 

379
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,350
but I
definitely smash your face and then

380
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,360
definitely smash your face and then
 

381
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,750
definitely smash your face and then
break your arm and stomp on your head it

382
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:12,760
break your arm and stomp on your head it
 

383
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,710
break your arm and stomp on your head it
it's fine it works do you get it so obey

384
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
it's fine it works do you get it so obey
 

385
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,629
it's fine it works do you get it so obey
the values that you're feeling don't

386
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
the values that you're feeling don't
 

387
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,150
the values that you're feeling don't
have a technique okay try

388
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,160
have a technique okay try
 

389
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:33,189
have a technique okay try
[Music]

390
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:33,199

 

391
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,150

so the first rep rep one was an external

392
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
so the first rep rep one was an external
 

393
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,350
so the first rep rep one was an external
deviation rep two is an external bracing

394
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
deviation rep two is an external bracing
 

395
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,629
deviation rep two is an external bracing
you got two more to do

396
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:45,639

 

397
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,990

right external

398
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000

 

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,790

deviation and then an

400
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
deviation and then an
 

401
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,350
deviation and then an
external bracing that had to go into an

402
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,360
external bracing that had to go into an
 

403
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,269
external bracing that had to go into an
external deviation

404
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279

 

405
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,629

why do you think well first I'm doing

406
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:03,639
why do you think well first I'm doing
 

407
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,990
why do you think well first I'm doing
external because I can't do

408
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000

 

409
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,389

internal but why do you think you got

410
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:11,399
internal but why do you think you got
 

411
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,710
internal but why do you think you got
away with the external

412
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
away with the external
 

413
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,470
away with the external
deviation on him and then on this one

414
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
deviation on him and then on this one
 

415
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,269
deviation on him and then on this one
you couldn't because he was able to uh

416
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:22,279
you couldn't because he was able to uh
 

417
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,230
you couldn't because he was able to uh
refine the center and push again yep

418
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,240
refine the center and push again yep
 

419
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,550
refine the center and push again yep
okay so he's more athletic more mobile

420
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
okay so he's more athletic more mobile
 

421
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,870
okay so he's more athletic more mobile
better condition conditioning and that's

422
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
better condition conditioning and that's
 

423
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,670
better condition conditioning and that's
a better opponent meaning they can

424
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
a better opponent meaning they can
 

425
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,069
a better opponent meaning they can
regain their dynamic equilibrium it

426
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
regain their dynamic equilibrium it
 

427
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,310
regain their dynamic equilibrium it
causes all kinds of freaking problems

428
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
causes all kinds of freaking problems
 

429
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,110
causes all kinds of freaking problems
for us who are all I have is my external

430
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,120
for us who are all I have is my external
 

431
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,910
for us who are all I have is my external
athletic capacity against him but if I

432
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:44,920
athletic capacity against him but if I
 

433
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,790
athletic capacity against him but if I
had the internal it does not doesn't

434
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:47,800
had the internal it does not doesn't
 

435
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,910
had the internal it does not doesn't
matter okay so there there is a a

436
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:50,920
matter okay so there there is a a
 

437
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,310
matter okay so there there is a a
martial viability aspect to the internal

438
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
martial viability aspect to the internal
 

439
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,030
martial viability aspect to the internal
and that is is meant to deal with

440
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
and that is is meant to deal with
 

441
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,110
and that is is meant to deal with
asymmetry uh between you and the

442
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
asymmetry uh between you and the
 

443
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,389
asymmetry uh between you and the
opponent okay all right I'll give you

444
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
opponent okay all right I'll give you
 

445
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,949
opponent okay all right I'll give you
one more a very common one so if if I

446
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:05,959
one more a very common one so if if I
 

447
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,870
one more a very common one so if if I
have one arm and I can't get out of it

448
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
have one arm and I can't get out of it
 

449
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,470
have one arm and I can't get out of it
in any other way like I just can't get

450
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,480
in any other way like I just can't get
 

451
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,269
in any other way like I just can't get
it got trapped and he's hugging his

452
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
it got trapped and he's hugging his
 

453
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,949
it got trapped and he's hugging his
elbow down on me do you see I can't get

454
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:15,959
elbow down on me do you see I can't get
 

455
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,509
elbow down on me do you see I can't get
it I'm not going to push on it it's just

456
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:18,519
it I'm not going to push on it it's just
 

457
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,550
it I'm not going to push on it it's just
not going to I'm not going to use it

458
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
not going to I'm not going to use it
 

459
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,710
not going to I'm not going to use it
what I'm going to do instead I'm going

460
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
what I'm going to do instead I'm going
 

461
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,189
what I'm going to do instead I'm going
to show you it's a cou net but it's with

462
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:26,199
to show you it's a cou net but it's with
 

463
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,189
to show you it's a cou net but it's with
my body so he's he's in that so I can't

464
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:30,199
my body so he's he's in that so I can't
 

465
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,670
my body so he's he's in that so I can't
get it out so I can't get the underhook

466
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:32,680
get it out so I can't get the underhook
 

467
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,389
get it out so I can't get the underhook
and I can't get the overhook that's why

468
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
and I can't get the overhook that's why
 

469
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,829
and I can't get the overhook that's why
he'll drop his elbow and pin it there

470
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:36,839
he'll drop his elbow and pin it there
 

471
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,110
he'll drop his elbow and pin it there
okay but this makes that whole thing

472
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,120
okay but this makes that whole thing
 

473
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,749
okay but this makes that whole thing
adhesional now I just add this side come

474
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:44,759
adhesional now I just add this side come
 

475
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,430
adhesional now I just add this side come
over

476
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,440
over
 

477
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,230
over
here okay so I he's pushing I'm ground

478
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
here okay so I he's pushing I'm ground
 

479
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,269
here okay so I he's pushing I'm ground
I'm ground vectoring get him deep into

480
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
I'm ground vectoring get him deep into
 

481
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,189
I'm ground vectoring get him deep into
the charge and then this hand I drop

482
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:56,199
the charge and then this hand I drop
 

483
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:59,990
the charge and then this hand I drop
that elbow okay so same thing here drop

484
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
that elbow okay so same thing here drop
 

485
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,189
that elbow okay so same thing here drop
the

486
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:06,199

 

487
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,990

elbow you smash it drop your elbow get

488
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,000
elbow you smash it drop your elbow get
 

489
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,949
elbow you smash it drop your elbow get
it up I'll get it up you see and I'll

490
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
it up I'll get it up you see and I'll
 

491
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,110
it up I'll get it up you see and I'll
snap it snap it you got to protect your

492
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
snap it snap it you got to protect your
 

493
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,509
snap it snap it you got to protect your
elbow there it is and now stop but now

494
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:18,519
elbow there it is and now stop but now
 

495
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,430
elbow there it is and now stop but now
the whole thing works

496
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
the whole thing works
 

497
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,710
the whole thing works
okay come back lower this a lot cuz the

498
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
okay come back lower this a lot cuz the
 

499
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,749
okay come back lower this a lot cuz the
lower this is the less High this has to

500
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
lower this is the less High this has to

it's a subtle thing that I did okay so
here's the Kut okay and then we're going

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,000
here's the Kut okay and then we're going
 

653
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,870
here's the Kut okay and then we're going
to add your inertia okay okay so you

654
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
to add your inertia okay okay so you
 

655
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,350
to add your inertia okay okay so you
drive your

656
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:50,360
drive your
 

657
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,669
drive your
inertia and you feel the yes the lock

Nur here this is now my momentum I go
 

665
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,909
Nur here this is now my momentum I go
here like this hi you see hi you had no

666
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:14,919
here like this hi you see hi you had no
 

667
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,590
here like this hi you see hi you had no
momentum it doesn't lock you into place

668
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:18,600
momentum it doesn't lock you into place
 

669
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,390

turn get out of it there you

670

turn get out of it there you
 

671
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,830
turn get out of it there you
