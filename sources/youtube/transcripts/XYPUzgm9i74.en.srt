footwork today but
 

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,990
footwork today but
the footwork has a timing not just a

the footwork has a timing not just a
 

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,910
the footwork has a timing not just a

spatial
 

61
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,350

aspect so

62
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360

 

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,390

the grip is going to be my

the grip is going to be my
 

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,670
the grip is going to be my
measuring tool so when i tencon

66
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
measuring tool so when i tencon
 

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,830
measuring tool so when i tencon
at the wrong rate or the wrong degree of

68
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
at the wrong rate or the wrong degree of
 

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,430
at the wrong rate or the wrong degree of
rotation

70
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
rotation
 

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,670
rotation
uh this you will start to pull the

72
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
uh this you will start to pull the
 

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,190

this way and it leaves an outward
 

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,869
this way and it leaves an outward
pulling energy

84
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
pulling energy
 

85
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,550

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,149
i step to stay on the other side rotate
to stay on the other side

to stay on the other side
 

113
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,149
to stay on the other side
and it's always pushing him

114
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159

 

115
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,750

and now it's always just pushing

116
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760

 

117
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,270

the pull

118
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280

 

119
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,550

the pull

120
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560

 

121
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:53,090

and push

125
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,710

so using the hand as the metric you can

126
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
so using the hand as the metric you can
 

127
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,350
so using the hand as the metric you can
see

129
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,630
see
if i step here i

130
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
if i step here i
 

131
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,229
if i step here i
am too far back i'm not in this

132
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
am too far back i'm not in this
 

133
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,350
am too far back i'm not in this
part okay

134
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
part okay
 

135
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,789
part okay
so on this side i go here i'm going to

136
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
so on this side i go here i'm going to
 

137
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,710
so on this side i go here i'm going to
step here that's going to be a pull

138
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
step here that's going to be a pull
 

139
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,469
step here that's going to be a pull
can you see that because i am on the

140
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
can you see that because i am on the
 

141
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,950
can you see that because i am on the
inside of the circle that i'm about to

142
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
inside of the circle that i'm about to
 

143
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,510
inside of the circle that i'm about to
draw

144
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
draw
 

145
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,430
draw
okay it's going to be a pull you see

146
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
okay it's going to be a pull you see
 

147
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,550
okay it's going to be a pull you see
okay well

148
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
okay well
 

149
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,950
okay well
i'm not in the back i'm not on the

150
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
i'm not in the back i'm not on the
 

151
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,030
i'm not in the back i'm not on the
positive side of the circle

positive side of the circle
 

153
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,150
positive side of the circle
so what happens let's say that

154
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
so what happens let's say that
 

155
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,629
so what happens let's say that
he got deflected at this way or i

156
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
he got deflected at this way or i
 

157
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,469
he got deflected at this way or i
deviated

158
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479

 

159
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,510

and when he turns to fight and i do my

167
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,060

so you're using the hand

178
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
so you're using the hand
 

179
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,150
so you're using the hand
but you need to pay attention that

180

do you think that you're there
 

185
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,670
do you think that you're there
and i go to there

186
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680

 

187
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,510

my goal is to get on the positive side

188
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
my goal is to get on the positive side
 

189
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,830
my goal is to get on the positive side
of his aggressive

190
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:34,840
of his aggressive
 

191
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,629
of his aggressive
recalibrating towards me once i start

192
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
recalibrating towards me once i start
 

193
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,870
recalibrating towards me once i start
the fight rotating he's got to rotate

194
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
the fight rotating he's got to rotate
 

195
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,070
the fight rotating he's got to rotate
inside that

196
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
inside that
 

197
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,029
inside that
to get a line attached back on me and i

198
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
to get a line attached back on me and i
 

199
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,070
to get a line attached back on me and i
need to be in that

200
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
need to be in that
 

201
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,110
need to be in that
corner so that i can stay ahead of that

202
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120

 

203
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,550

i go right here now every time he turns

204
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
i go right here now every time he turns
 

205
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,189
i go right here now every time he turns
into me

206
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
into me
 

207
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,550
into me
he's gonna be behind me okay

208
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560

 

209
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:17,189

boom in

210
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199

 

211
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,469

this is uh count three right this

212
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
this is uh count three right this
 

213
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,790
this is uh count three right this
single pivot point is what allows me to

214
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
single pivot point is what allows me to
 

215
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,550
single pivot point is what allows me to
do that

216
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
do that
 

217
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,270
do that
so if i go here and i double pivot point

218
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
so if i go here and i double pivot point
 

219
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,110
so if i go here and i double pivot point
we're gonna we're gonna stop the fight

220
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
we're gonna we're gonna stop the fight
 

221
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,350
we're gonna we're gonna stop the fight
i do have i'm on the other side of the

222
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
i do have i'm on the other side of the
 

223
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,950
i do have i'm on the other side of the
circle but i'm gonna double pivot point

224
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
circle but i'm gonna double pivot point
 

225
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,110

rotation he's going to turn at me and

226
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
rotation he's going to turn at me and
 

227
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,230
rotation he's going to turn at me and
i'm turning at him

228
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
i'm turning at him
 

229
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,270
i'm turning at him
and you see i'm not ahead of the circle

230
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
and you see i'm not ahead of the circle
 

231
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,029
and you see i'm not ahead of the circle
so i'm doing on the other side so i go

232
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
so i'm doing on the other side so i go
 

233
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,309
so i'm doing on the other side so i go
oh i said i'm gonna head in a circle

234
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
oh i said i'm gonna head in a circle
 

235
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,790
oh i said i'm gonna head in a circle
but now i'm gonna double pivot point

236
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
but now i'm gonna double pivot point
 

237
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,469
but now i'm gonna double pivot point
he's gonna double through the point and

238
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
he's gonna double through the point and
 

239
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,110
he's gonna double through the point and
i'm not

240
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
i'm not
 

241
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,870

see i'm continuing to move
 

251
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,589
see i'm continuing to move
to the young side of the circle so as he

252
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
to the young side of the circle so as he
 

253
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,629
to the young side of the circle so as he
rotates

254
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
rotates
 

255
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,189
rotates
you have a deviation in the weight shift

256
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
you have a deviation in the weight shift
 

257
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,309
you have a deviation in the weight shift

there's nowhere left to go and that's
where the yin cycle is born

272
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120

 

273
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,629

i'm going to take off the hand now okay

274
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
i'm going to take off the hand now okay
 

275
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,790
i'm going to take off the hand now okay
and he's going to rotate and i'm going

276
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
and he's going to rotate and i'm going
 

277

to rotate
 

279
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,150
to rotate
and i can't rotate anymore and that's

280
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
and i can't rotate anymore and that's
 

281
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,830
and i can't rotate anymore and that's
when i take the other foot

282
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840

 

283
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:06,950

in

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960

 

285
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,550

you have a second rule to do you're

286
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
you have a second rule to do you're
 

287
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,150
you have a second rule to do you're
going to try to dress

288
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
going to try to dress
 

289
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:24,830
going to try to dress
and i keep turning

290
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

293
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,070

and you can see that it is still a push

294
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
and you can see that it is still a push
 

295
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,630
and you can see that it is still a push
you see i'm still pushing so i don't

296
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
you see i'm still pushing so i don't
 

297
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,949
you see i'm still pushing so i don't
need to be on the inside and grab him

298
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
need to be on the inside and grab him
 

299
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,949
need to be on the inside and grab him
i'm still pushing

301
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,350

in turn you see he's still pushing down

302
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
in turn you see he's still pushing down
 

303
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,630
in turn you see he's still pushing down
on the inside

304
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640

he's trying to turn okay so

312
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
he's trying to turn okay so
 

313
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,790
he's trying to turn okay so
he turns and i start the second

314
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
he turns and i start the second
 

315
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,190
he turns and i start the second
deviation with the weight shift

316
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
deviation with the weight shift
 

317
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,870
deviation with the weight shift
then step into the in space

318
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880

321
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,910

this turn you're not walking around

322
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
this turn you're not walking around
 

323
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,030

331
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,910

okay let's try okay

332
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920

 

333
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,269

let's pre-summarize so the hand

334
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
let's pre-summarize so the hand
 

335
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,230
let's pre-summarize so the hand
the grip is used as a metric to tell me

336
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
the grip is used as a metric to tell me
 

337
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,990
the grip is used as a metric to tell me
if i'm in the right place

338
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
if i'm in the right place
 

339
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,030
if i'm in the right place
on the shoulder how well if i'm pulling

340
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
on the shoulder how well if i'm pulling
 

341
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,870
on the shoulder how well if i'm pulling
on the hand i will not be in the right

342
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
on the hand i will not be in the right
 

343
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,470
on the hand i will not be in the right
place for the shoulder

344
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
place for the shoulder
 

345
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,269
place for the shoulder
okay which is why once once i understand

346
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
okay which is why once once i understand
 

347
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,870
okay which is why once once i understand
where i'm supposed to be

348
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
where i'm supposed to be
 

349
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,870
where i'm supposed to be
you can start changing it and you're

350
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
you can start changing it and you're
 

351
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,389
you can start changing it and you're
still okay

352
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
still okay
 

353
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,550
still okay
so if i was out here and i pull and he

354
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
so if i was out here and i pull and he
 

355
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,150
so if i was out here and i pull and he
turns on me i'm not going to be

356
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
turns on me i'm not going to be
 

357
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,290
turns on me i'm not going to be
okay

358
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,300
okay
 

359
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,670
okay

and we're doing this because the

362
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
and we're doing this because the
 

363
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,829
and we're doing this because the
original xy is kind of misleading and

364
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
original xy is kind of misleading and
 

365
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,990
original xy is kind of misleading and
the beginner's always thinking x y you

366
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
the beginner's always thinking x y you
 

367
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,590
the beginner's always thinking x y you
picture this guy over there and you're

368
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
picture this guy over there and you're
 

369
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,949
picture this guy over there and you're
going to try to get there

370
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
going to try to get there
 

371
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,630
going to try to get there
no i'll we'll get there in the end and

372
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
no i'll we'll get there in the end and
 

373
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,870
no i'll we'll get there in the end and
i'll explain to you how this might work

374
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
i'll explain to you how this might work
 

375
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,990
i'll explain to you how this might work
okay as i said when when things really

376
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
okay as i said when when things really
 

377
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,829
okay as i said when when things really
start happening that's when aikido

378
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
start happening that's when aikido
 

379
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,269
start happening that's when aikido
footwork makes sense

380
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
footwork makes sense
 

381
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,389
footwork makes sense
xy things are not happening okay

382
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
xy things are not happening okay
 

383
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,269
xy things are not happening okay
so we are going to artificially create a

384
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
so we are going to artificially create a
 

385
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,790
so we are going to artificially create a
different angle you could have done it

386
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
different angle you could have done it
 

387
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,670
different angle you could have done it
like this

388
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
like this
 

389
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,550
like this
the guy does comes in over here do you

390
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
the guy does comes in over here do you
 

391
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,110
the guy does comes in over here do you
see

392
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
see
 

393
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,030
see
he comes in over here and i do the same

394
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
he comes in over here and i do the same
 

395
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,550
he comes in over here and i do the same
flip work

396
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
flip work
 

397
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,870
flip work
you could have done that but i wanted to

398
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
you could have done that but i wanted to
 

399
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,470
you could have done that but i wanted to
combine another skill

400
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
combine another skill
 

401
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,069
combine another skill
which is this skill how do i take

402
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
which is this skill how do i take
 

403
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,310
which is this skill how do i take
the original uh axis of rotation

404
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
the original uh axis of rotation
 

405
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,949
the original uh axis of rotation
from the x y axis and just by shifting

406
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
from the x y axis and just by shifting
 

407
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,470
from the x y axis and just by shifting
my weight i've changed it

408
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
my weight i've changed it
 

409
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,710
my weight i've changed it
i've changed it that's a very important

410
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
i've changed it that's a very important
 

411
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,190
i've changed it that's a very important
skill so we're combining two skills

412
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200

 

413
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,550

as i do this if i'm doing everything

414
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
as i do this if i'm doing everything
 

415
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,230
as i do this if i'm doing everything
correct so i'm not here we're in the

416
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
correct so i'm not here we're in the
 

417
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,269
correct so i'm not here we're in the
second drill

418
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
second drill
 

419
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,910
second drill
and i single pivot point he um

420
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
and i single pivot point he um
 

421
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,790
and i single pivot point he um
i had him try and turn into me and i was

422
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
i had him try and turn into me and i was
 

423
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,269
i had him try and turn into me and i was
using that to measure okay

424
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
using that to measure okay
 

425
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,470
using that to measure okay
but he's not uh

426
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
but he's not uh
 

427
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,590
but he's not uh
going around me on his own

428
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
going around me on his own
 

429
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,710
going around me on his own
okay so i'm here and i'm just you you

430
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
okay so i'm here and i'm just you you
 

431
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,069
okay so i'm here and i'm just you you
don't move

432
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
don't move
 

433
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,269
don't move
you don't he's trying not to move

434
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
you don't he's trying not to move
 

435
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,430
you don't he's trying not to move
going to move why is he going to move

436
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440

 

437
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,990

now

438
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000

 

439
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,190

am i doing this no i'm pushing

440
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
am i doing this no i'm pushing
 

441
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,069
am i doing this no i'm pushing
so every time i stress his line of

442
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
so every time i stress his line of
 

443
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,310
so every time i stress his line of
gravity he has to move to adjust it do

444
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
gravity he has to move to adjust it do
 

445
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,190
gravity he has to move to adjust it do
you see that

446
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
you see that
 

447
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,269
you see that
it's not it's not him sticking to my

448
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
it's not it's not him sticking to my
 

449
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,389
it's not it's not him sticking to my
hand

450
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
hand
 

451
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,509
hand
and then him doing the adhesion

452
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
and then him doing the adhesion
 

453
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,710
and then him doing the adhesion
and it's not him walking around me okay

454
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
and it's not him walking around me okay
 

455
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,710
and it's not him walking around me okay
and the reason why that's a problem

456
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
and the reason why that's a problem
 

457
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,269
and the reason why that's a problem
is i don't have to do any of this right

458
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
is i don't have to do any of this right
 

459
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,910
is i don't have to do any of this right
if he's going to position himself

460
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
if he's going to position himself
 

461
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,230
if he's going to position himself
so you go ahead and do that you see i

462
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
so you go ahead and do that you see i
 

463
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,670
so you go ahead and do that you see i
could be i'm way to f

464
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
could be i'm way to f
 

465
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,150
could be i'm way to f
out here if i got in the right spot

466
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
out here if i got in the right spot
 

467
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,870
out here if i got in the right spot
and i'm here on on uh where i'm supposed

468
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
and i'm here on on uh where i'm supposed
 

469
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,670
and i'm here on on uh where i'm supposed
to be

470
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
to be
 

471
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,509
to be
this is pushing do you see it's pushing

472
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
this is pushing do you see it's pushing
 

473
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,470
this is pushing do you see it's pushing
then and then i can use the ik adhesion

474
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
then and then i can use the ik adhesion
 

475
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,190
then and then i can use the ik adhesion
so i push

476
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
so i push
 

477
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,389
so i push
i want him to go this way here he is

478
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
i want him to go this way here he is
 

479
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,910
i want him to go this way here he is
it's not him so he and again the greater

480
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
it's not him so he and again the greater
 

481
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,949
it's not him so he and again the greater
he does the more

482
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
he does the more
 

483
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,910
he does the more
he he does not want to go it creates you

484
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
he he does not want to go it creates you
 

485
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,470
he he does not want to go it creates you
see

486
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
see
 

487
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,190
see
it creates the adhesion it makes it

488
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
it creates the adhesion it makes it
 

489
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,389
it creates the adhesion it makes it
easier to do

490
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
easier to do
 

491
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,470
easier to do
it's the guy who's just standing there

492
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
it's the guy who's just standing there
 

493
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,949
it's the guy who's just standing there
oh that that one is a lot harder to do

494
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
oh that that one is a lot harder to do
 

495
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,710
oh that that one is a lot harder to do
but the guy who doesn't want to go

496
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
but the guy who doesn't want to go
 

497
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,110
but the guy who doesn't want to go
oh he's gonna go he's gonna go in a

498
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
oh he's gonna go he's gonna go in a
 

499
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,910
oh he's gonna go he's gonna go in a
circle

500

pony trick and you're like sticking here
that's not helping anyone

512
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
that's not helping anyone
 

513
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,590
that's not helping anyone
okay so i'm here boom i'm moving him

514
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600

 

515
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,670

we could do this same drill like that

516
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
we could do this same drill like that
 

517
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,069
we could do this same drill like that
i'm moving here

518
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
i'm moving here
 

519
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,389
i'm moving here
with the push out

520
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
with the push out
 

521
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,590
with the push out
this center is going like that

522
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
this center is going like that
 

523
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,069
this center is going like that
moving his line of gravity out here but

524
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
moving his line of gravity out here but
 

525
00:13:44,079 --> 00:14:00,069
moving his line of gravity out here but
at this point

526
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079

 

527
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,110

okay let's play with that a little bit

528
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
okay let's play with that a little bit
 

529
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:13,110
okay let's play with that a little bit
so that the uk is stocked up

530
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120

 

531
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,150

okay let's go right okay

532
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
okay let's go right okay
 

533
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,470
okay let's go right okay
so i'm using my hand metrics we'll go

534
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
so i'm using my hand metrics we'll go
 

535
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,910
so i'm using my hand metrics we'll go
back to the previous drill

536
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
back to the previous drill
 

537
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,870
back to the previous drill
so he's he's uh now turning into me to

538
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
so he's he's uh now turning into me to
 

539
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,670
so he's he's uh now turning into me to
address

540
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
address
 

541
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,870
address
okay and let's give him like a just a

542
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
okay and let's give him like a just a
 

543
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,069
okay and let's give him like a just a
block okay do you get it

544
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
block okay do you get it
 

545
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,269
block okay do you get it
so he goes here and he's going to block

546
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
so he goes here and he's going to block
 

547
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,110
so he goes here and he's going to block
boom just give me another

548
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
boom just give me another
 

549
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,389
boom just give me another
line of attack he's going to lose the

550
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
line of attack he's going to lose the
 

551
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:49,110
line of attack he's going to lose the
first line of attack and comes in both

552
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120

 

553
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:58,389

there you go

554
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
there you go
 

555
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,230
there you go
and i'll clear the hand so he's not

556
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
and i'll clear the hand so he's not
 

557
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,590
and i'll clear the hand so he's not
freaked out

558
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
freaked out
 

559
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,580
freaked out
okay

560
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:04,590

 

561
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,310

[Music]

562
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320

 

563
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,069

okay let's let's get luke

564
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079

 

565
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,350

okay so we just gave him

566
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
okay so we just gave him
 

567
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,230
okay so we just gave him
a new linear vector and that can

568
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
a new linear vector and that can
 

569
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,030
a new linear vector and that can
represent

570
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
represent
 

571
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,150
represent
anything kick knee clinch

572
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
anything kick knee clinch
 

573
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,230
anything kick knee clinch
tackle double leg takedown doesn't

574
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
tackle double leg takedown doesn't
 

575
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,430
tackle double leg takedown doesn't
doesn't matter

576
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
doesn't matter
 

577
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,710
doesn't matter
we're just working on the strategy

578
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
we're just working on the strategy
 

579
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,710
we're just working on the strategy
of idiom 10 okay so you can see

580
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
of idiom 10 okay so you can see
 

581
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,990
of idiom 10 okay so you can see
if i can't go in that would be a clash

582
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
if i can't go in that would be a clash
 

583
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,629
if i can't go in that would be a clash
i can't go straight back that's not

584
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
i can't go straight back that's not
 

585
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,790
i can't go straight back that's not
gonna do me anything

586
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800

 

587
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,910

so we do the single point pivot he goes

588
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
so we do the single point pivot he goes
 

589
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,790
so we do the single point pivot he goes
and i'm on the other side

590
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
and i'm on the other side
 

591
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,230
and i'm on the other side
so he's gonna go uh as he's gonna be as

592
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
so he's gonna go uh as he's gonna be as
 

593
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,670
so he's gonna go uh as he's gonna be as
athletic as he can

594
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
athletic as he can
 

595
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:13,910
athletic as he can
okay so one boom

596
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920

 

597
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:24,550

there you go

598
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560

 

599
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,150

so the single point pivot

600
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160

 

601
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,550

again i'm not going like this he goes

602
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
again i'm not going like this he goes
 

603
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,150
again i'm not going like this he goes
i'm not going like that you see he'll

604
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
i'm not going like that you see he'll
 

605
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,470
i'm not going like that you see he'll
clip

606
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
clip
 

607
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,949
clip
you if your line of gravity is in the

608
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
you if your line of gravity is in the
 

609
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,389
you if your line of gravity is in the
middle of your feet you're double

610
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
middle of your feet you're double
 

611
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,269
middle of your feet you're double
pivoting

612
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
pivoting
 

613
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,870
pivoting
you're staying on the line of attack

614
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
you're staying on the line of attack
 

615
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,629
you're staying on the line of attack
longer than you think you are

616
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
longer than you think you are
 

617
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,829
longer than you think you are
that's what we went in over in the third

618
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
that's what we went in over in the third
 

619
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,069
that's what we went in over in the third
count of the eight council buddy

620
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
count of the eight council buddy
 

621
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:58,830
count of the eight council buddy
so instead we're here

622
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:58,840

 

623
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,949

[Music]

624
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959

 

625
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:19,110

time your turn

626
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
time your turn
 

627
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,710
time your turn
okay let's try so

628
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720

 

629
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,750

when when i push i don't do a bracing

630
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
when when i push i don't do a bracing
 

631
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,750
when when i push i don't do a bracing
angle

632
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
angle
 

633
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,070
angle
so my my center can ground vector

634
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
so my my center can ground vector
 

635
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,830
so my my center can ground vector
on on the fly i don't need to get this a

636
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
on on the fly i don't need to get this a
 

637
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,669
on on the fly i don't need to get this a
frame here i can just walk

638
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679

 

639
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,549

my job was to do a spinal displacement i

640
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
my job was to do a spinal displacement i
 

641
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,470
my job was to do a spinal displacement i
have to do that that's prescribed as

642
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
have to do that that's prescribed as
 

643
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,310
have to do that that's prescribed as
a bouquet antenna so i am doing that

644
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
a bouquet antenna so i am doing that
 

645
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,029
a bouquet antenna so i am doing that
but i'm not doing it from here

646
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039

 

647
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,070

my body has to displace his spine his

648
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
my body has to displace his spine his
 

649
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,510
my body has to displace his spine his
spinal displacement

650
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
spinal displacement
 

651
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,230
spinal displacement
means his spine is there and i displace

652
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
means his spine is there and i displace
 

653
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,549
means his spine is there and i displace
it with my spine

654
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559

 

655
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,830

not spinal manipulation i'm not doing

656
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
not spinal manipulation i'm not doing
 

657
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,909
not spinal manipulation i'm not doing
that when he does the first yin

658
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
that when he does the first yin
 

659
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,150
that when he does the first yin
absorption if i do a bracing angle

660
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
absorption if i do a bracing angle

you're going to have your line of

662
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
you're going to have your line of
 

663
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,510
you're going to have your line of
gravity fall out of your base of support

664
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
gravity fall out of your base of support
 

665
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,150
gravity fall out of your base of support
and you kind of stumble and then you're

666
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
and you kind of stumble and then you're
 

667
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,830
and you kind of stumble and then you're
going to turn but you already have this

668
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
going to turn but you already have this
 

669
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,190
going to turn but you already have this
gap

670
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
gap
 

671
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,510
gap
if had this happened he should have just

672
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
if had this happened he should have just
 

673
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,390
if had this happened he should have just
knocked me

674
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400

 

675
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,950

the reason i'm deviating is i don't have

676
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
the reason i'm deviating is i don't have
 

677
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,430
the reason i'm deviating is i don't have
the

678
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
the
 

679
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,029
the
my for a strike

680
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039

 

681
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,350

but this is a very unrealistic thing i

682
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
but this is a very unrealistic thing i
 

683
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,830
but this is a very unrealistic thing i
can't really do anything with this

684
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
can't really do anything with this
 

685
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,350
can't really do anything with this
in a training environment so

686
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
in a training environment so
 

687
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,350
in a training environment so
he does the first deviation with the arm

688
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
he does the first deviation with the arm
 

689
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,470
he does the first deviation with the arm
clear

690
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
clear
 

691
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,510
clear
and i'm here i'm in perfect balance he

692
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
and i'm here i'm in perfect balance he
 

693
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,990
and i'm here i'm in perfect balance he
didn't do

694
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
didn't do
 

695
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,630
didn't do
anything to affect my base of support

696
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
anything to affect my base of support
 

697
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,510
anything to affect my base of support
right

698
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
right
 

699
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,390
right
my movement is here

700
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400

 

701
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,110

just like if he bombs under the right

702
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
just like if he bombs under the right
 

703
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,549

i don't go

706
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720

 

707
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,190

i turn and face the guy

708
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200

 

709
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,230

so it's the same thing abstractly done

710
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
so it's the same thing abstractly done
 

711
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,310
so it's the same thing abstractly done
my body moves in with me and i turn

712
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320

 

713
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,950

if i go flying by him

714
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960

 

715
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,510

then he can double pivot and do all that

716
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
then he can double pivot and do all that
 

717
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,990
then he can double pivot and do all that
crazy

718
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
crazy
 

719
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:51,990

my movement is much tighter

720
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
my movement is much tighter
 

721
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:03,190
my movement is much tighter
body is moving by you

722
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200

when i take that line i distract him

731
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,789

so he's gonna do the foot maneuvers

732
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
so he's gonna do the foot maneuvers
 

733
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:35,350
so he's gonna do the foot maneuvers
and he has to do it right

734
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
and he has to do it right
 

735
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,230
and he has to do it right
okay he brings his face of support back

736
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
okay he brings his face of support back
 

737
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,909
okay he brings his face of support back
in with his balance

738
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
in with his balance
 

739
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,950

i'm over here watch watch as he starts

742
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
to turn
 

743
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,950

i'm rotating with him

i'm rotating with him
 

745
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,549

okay pay attention keep up the pace okay
 

781
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,149
okay pay attention keep up the pace okay
so uh we're gonna come into keyhole in a

782
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
so uh we're gonna come into keyhole in a
 

783
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:36,710
so uh we're gonna come into keyhole in a
little bit

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
little bit
 

785
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,390
little bit
so he starts to turn right long on the

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
so he starts to turn right long on the
 

787
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,909

791
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,830

so uh sometimes again abstractly

792
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
so uh sometimes again abstractly
 

793
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,070

a smart attacker realizes i'm going to

give my back

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,549
give my back
and they'll push through the vortex

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
it's kind of happening here just in the

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,909
it's kind of happening here just in the

drug okay
 

805
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,029

and i want to address that until and

so he's turning in on me and he realizes

810
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
so he's turning in on me and he realizes
 

811
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,350
so he's turning in on me and he realizes
he missed and he pulls out of

he missed and he pulls out of

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,310

it feels like the worst strategy is

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
it feels like the worst strategy is
 

817
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,230
it feels like the worst strategy is
actually the sounder of the two

818
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
actually the sounder of the two
 

819
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,549
actually the sounder of the two
okay so we're gonna deal with that one

820
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
okay so we're gonna deal with that one
 

821
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,590
okay so we're gonna deal with that one
first so

822
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
first so
 

823
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,830
first so
i'm here and because i'm moving here

824
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
i'm here and because i'm moving here
 

825
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,750
i'm here and because i'm moving here
you're gonna find that you can get that

826
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760

 

827
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,230

if i'm doing the deviation you're not

828
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
if i'm doing the deviation you're not
 

829
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,430

going to get it

and that is part of your footwork
 

833
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,390

840
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
defense and it
 

841
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,990
defense and it
was not happening at the cost of the

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
was not happening at the cost of the
 

843
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,510

i could the second time i might not make
 

1031
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,909
i could the second time i might not make
it

1032
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
it
 

1033
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,669
it
so you don't want to train to do it

1034
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
so you don't want to train to do it
 

1035
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,310
so you don't want to train to do it
again and i want these skills and i want

1036
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
again and i want these skills and i want
 

1037
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,350
again and i want these skills and i want
to understand it even ten times

1038
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
to understand it even ten times
 

1039
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,510
to understand it even ten times
so again this is all just kihon

1040
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
so again this is all just kihon
 

1041
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,630
so again this is all just kihon
abstraction

1042
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
abstraction
 

1043
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,789
abstraction
okay so let's say i'm over here

1044
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
okay so let's say i'm over here
 

1045
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,590
okay so let's say i'm over here
and as i said the new metric was this uh

1046
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
and as i said the new metric was this uh
 

1047
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,990
and as i said the new metric was this uh
cookie nugget and i can't do it when i'm

1048
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
cookie nugget and i can't do it when i'm
 

1049
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,070
cookie nugget and i can't do it when i'm
doing all those things wrong

1050
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
doing all those things wrong
 

1051
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,789
doing all those things wrong
and i'm over here so what do you have to

1052
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
and i'm over here so what do you have to
 

1053
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,350
and i'm over here so what do you have to
do

1054
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
do
 

1055
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,820
do
you got to get the kazushi again

1056
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:36,830
you got to get the kazushi again
 

1057
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,630
you got to get the kazushi again

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
that's why you want to go into idi
 

1061
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,389
that's why you want to go into idi
or the other coke united is you you

1062
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
or the other coke united is you you
 

1063
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,470
or the other coke united is you you
don't you're out of place

1064
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
don't you're out of place
 

1065
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,990
don't you're out of place
to do the technique you're out of place

1066
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
to do the technique you're out of place
 

1067
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,789
to do the technique you're out of place
in place well maybe you get there maybe

1068
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
in place well maybe you get there maybe
 

1069
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,149
in place well maybe you get there maybe
you don't

1070
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
you don't
 

1071
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,669
you don't
but every time you roll the dice

1072
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
but every time you roll the dice
 

1073
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,070
but every time you roll the dice
it's not that you all now i get a second

1074
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
it's not that you all now i get a second
 

1075
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,830
it's not that you all now i get a second
chance again you get a second chance of

1076
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
chance again you get a second chance of
 

1077
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,950
chance again you get a second chance of
not getting it

1078
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:02,960
not getting it
 

1079
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,950
not getting it
okay so this technique is here

1080
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
okay so this technique is here
 

1081
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,029
okay so this technique is here
i'm already in place when he turned and

1082
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
i'm already in place when he turned and
 

1083
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,310
i'm already in place when he turned and
i turned like this

1084
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
i turned like this
 

1085
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,029
i turned like this
the kazushi is already in place so

1086
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
the kazushi is already in place so
 

1087
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,990
the kazushi is already in place so
there's no need to set it up again

1088
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
there's no need to set it up again
 

1089
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,549
there's no need to set it up again
that's what we want i'm in here it's

1090
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
that's what we want i'm in here it's
 

1091
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:34,830
that's what we want i'm in here it's
already in place

1092
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:34,840

 

1093
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:43,110

so

1094
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120

 

1095
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,029

okay come on okay the second

1096
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
okay come on okay the second
 

1097
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,149
okay come on okay the second
response that the guy can do which is

1098
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
response that the guy can do which is
 

1099
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:50,549
response that the guy can do which is
more

1100
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
more
 

1101
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,070
more
common but not as skilled is he

1102
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
common but not as skilled is he
 

1103
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,870
common but not as skilled is he
turning he realizes he's not there

1104
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
turning he realizes he's not there
 

1105
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,830
turning he realizes he's not there
you're not there

1106
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
you're not there
 

1107
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,269
you're not there
and he's going to make a second

1108
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
and he's going to make a second
 

1109
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,230
and he's going to make a second
adjustment

1110
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240

 

1111
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,230

and this is where the spiral geometry

1112
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
and this is where the spiral geometry
 

1113
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,430
and this is where the spiral geometry
starts

1114
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
starts
 

1115
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,190
starts
okay so i'm here

1116
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
okay so i'm here
 

1117
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,110
okay so i'm here
he makes it realizes i'm not there and

1118
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
he makes it realizes i'm not there and
 

1119
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,830
he makes it realizes i'm not there and
he turns in again

1120
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840

 

1121
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:25,010

okay

1122
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,020

 

1123
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,789

[Music]

1124
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:26,799
[Music]
 

1125
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,389
[Music]
okay he turn turn it one more time

1126
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
okay he turn turn it one more time
 

1127
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,950
okay he turn turn it one more time
and he's gonna allow me on the tank on

1128
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
and he's gonna allow me on the tank on
 

1129
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,590
and he's gonna allow me on the tank on
to

1130
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
to
 

1131
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,509
to
do the projection

1132
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519

 

1133
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,950

long turning turn returning

1134
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960

 

1135
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,230

i don't i'm not reaching for him

1136
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
i don't i'm not reaching for him
 

1137
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,710
i don't i'm not reaching for him
around here going like this you see i'm

1138
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
around here going like this you see i'm
 

1139
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,389
around here going like this you see i'm
on the line

1140
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
on the line
 

1141
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,149
on the line
the technique is happening he's turning

1142
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
the technique is happening he's turning
 

1143
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,350
the technique is happening he's turning
he takes one more tight turn and there's

1144
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,360
he takes one more tight turn and there's
 

1145
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,310
he takes one more tight turn and there's
so we're going to keep the abstract

1146
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
so we're going to keep the abstract
 

1147
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,830
so we're going to keep the abstract
you'll still find that the technique

1148
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:12,840

 

1149
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,230

here

1150
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240

 

1151
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,990

i don't care what you grab you grab the

1152
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
i don't care what you grab you grab the
 

1153
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,070
i don't care what you grab you grab the
head you grab the ribs you can grab the

1154
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
head you grab the ribs you can grab the
 

1155
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,389
head you grab the ribs you can grab the
cape it doesn't matter okay but you

1156
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
cape it doesn't matter okay but you
 

1157
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,350
cape it doesn't matter okay but you
can't

1158
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
can't
 

1159
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,590
can't
you got to go back to your original

1160
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
you got to go back to your original
 

1161
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,870
you got to go back to your original
 itself

1162
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
itself
 

1163
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,029
itself
okay so you're turning and trying to

1164
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
okay so you're turning and trying to
 

1165
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,549
okay so you're turning and trying to
keep turning on the guy

1166
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
keep turning on the guy
 

1167
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,029
keep turning on the guy
he's not there keep turning on the guy

1168
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
he's not there keep turning on the guy
 

1169
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,549
he's not there keep turning on the guy
okay

1170
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559

 

1171
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,590

okay okay to understand the strategy

1172
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
okay okay to understand the strategy
 

1173
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,789
okay okay to understand the strategy
behind the footwork

1174
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
behind the footwork
 

1175
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,230
behind the footwork
we're using abstract vectors okay um

1176
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
we're using abstract vectors okay um
 

1177
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,470
we're using abstract vectors okay um
and then the problem is that you want to

1178
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
and then the problem is that you want to
 

1179
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,669
and then the problem is that you want to
go back in technique

1180
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
go back in technique
 

1181
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,190
go back in technique
so this guy comes here and then you go

1182
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,200
so this guy comes here and then you go
 

1183
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,950
so this guy comes here and then you go
like

1184
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960

 

1185
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,789

and then if we give them like a double

1186
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
and then if we give them like a double
 

1187
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,269
and then if we give them like a double
leg takedown or a

1188
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
leg takedown or a
 

1189
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,669
leg takedown or a
jab cross you're lost you don't know

1190
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
jab cross you're lost you don't know
 

1191
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,389
jab cross you're lost you don't know
what to do

1192
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
what to do
 

1193
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,070
what to do
okay so the metric i'm going to use here

1194
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
okay so the metric i'm going to use here
 

1195
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,389
okay so the metric i'm going to use here
is he rotates he's he's here like that

1196
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
is he rotates he's he's here like that
 

1197
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,269
is he rotates he's he's here like that
i don't i don't want to pick techniques

1198
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
i don't i don't want to pick techniques
 

1199
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,630
i don't i don't want to pick techniques
if i don't have to

1200
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
if i don't have to
 

1201

difference of that your mind is
different

1248
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
different
 

1249
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,430
different
when you do the techniques your mind's

1250
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
when you do the techniques your mind's
 

1251
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,069
when you do the techniques your mind's
out here you see you're trying to stop

1252
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
out here you see you're trying to stop
 

1253
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,790
out here you see you're trying to stop
the thing from happening and gain

1254
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
the thing from happening and gain
 

1255
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,230
the thing from happening and gain
control

1256
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240

1257
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,829
control
i'm not doing that he countered my

1258
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
i'm not doing that he countered my
 

1259
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,950
i'm not doing that he countered my
counter

1260
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
counter
 

1261
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,230
counter
do you see and so the ten con is setting

1262
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
do you see and so the ten con is setting
 

1263
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,030
do you see and so the ten con is setting
up

1264
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
up
 

1265
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,230
up
the movement here

1266
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,240
the movement here
 

1267
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,349
the movement here
how taking that line of gravity

1268
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:45,359
how taking that line of gravity
 

1269
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,589
how taking that line of gravity
back that way so he goes

1270
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
back that way so he goes
 

1271
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,669
back that way so he goes
and you can see i'm much closer than the

1272
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
and you can see i'm much closer than the
 

1273
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,869
and you can see i'm much closer than the
other technique

1274
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:52,879
other technique
 

1275
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:06,390
other technique
and then add your cocky projection

1276
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400

 

1277
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,790

that's different to me than this

1278
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800

 

1279
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,230

okay okay so uh

he's it's adhering with the centripetal
 

1529
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,190
he's it's adhering with the centripetal
centripetal energy

1530
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
centripetal energy
 

1531
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,829
centripetal energy
so we're doing this you see and i'm

1532
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
so we're doing this you see and i'm
 

1533
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,870
so we're doing this you see and i'm
going to create an ik adhesion here

1534
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:02,880
going to create an ik adhesion here
 

1535
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,670
going to create an ik adhesion here
it doesn't take any muscle

1536
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,680

 

1537
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,950

and as i create the ik adhesion here

1538
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
and as i create the ik adhesion here
 

1539
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,309
and as i create the ik adhesion here
right or here this hand

1540
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
right or here this hand
 

1541
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,710
right or here this hand
just ground vectors well here we are

1542
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
just ground vectors well here we are
 

1543
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,470
just ground vectors well here we are
we're in this position

1544
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
we're in this position
 

1545
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,390
we're in this position
here goes ike adhesion and boom

1546
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
here goes ike adhesion and boom
 

1547
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,829
here goes ike adhesion and boom
so there's no wrestling of my arms

1548
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:28,839

 

1549
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,950

boom

1550
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960

 

1551
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,349

my arms stay relaxed okay

1552
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359

 

1553
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,230

again i think as this is different

1554
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
again i think as this is different
 

1555
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,430
again i think as this is different
i'm in the right spot but this is

1556
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:45,440
i'm in the right spot but this is
 

1557
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:56,829
i'm in the right spot but this is
different too

1558
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:56,839

 

1559
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839

okay
