good all right guys not too bad okay
we're gonna do a
six minute meditation here when the bell
goes off or when the
alarm goes off ignore it you listen for
the bell so
three and three out observational
meditation so remember the idea is
to stay here in the moment so don't
track
thoughts down don't conjure up what
you're going to have for breakfast or
how your day zoom is going to be so
don't worry about that stuff just stay
in the moment
if you find yourself drifting then just
bring yourself back to the present
and don't give yourself a bad time about
it right so don't say oh i'm a bad boy
right because it doesn't matter it's
just more bad meditation if you're doing
that
all right here we go three and three out
[Music]
okay guys that's the end of our
meditation um
i want to say something about meditation
real quick if you want
meditation to be some mystical thing
sweet
um but i would turn the video off right
now i'm gonna talk a little bit about
the mundane
practical truth of meditation so i think
when people
see someone meditating they're like oh
that's awesome
mystic guy stuff and it is mystic guy
stuff
but it has a really important function
so just like the calisthenics for our
body the meditation
clears out our mind straightens and
strengthens our mind so
when you're meditating you are training
yourself
no different than lifting weights or
doing calisthenics or anything else so
at the end of this we're not meditating
because it's mystical and sweet we're
meditating because
it trains our mind in aikido our mind
being strong
is super important at least is important
probably more
much more important than our body being
strong the reason for that is because
in aikido we're talking about always
dealing with people who are bigger and
stronger than us and aikido the other
guys always stronger than me i have no
ability to physically compete with that
person or person
so because of that my mind has to be
sharp and i have to be able to call upon
my mind
to act the way i need it to act when i
need it to act that way right and so
that means having you know all different
uh four of the
the kokoro ideas right so mooshin
furoshin zanshin shoshin
so i can call upon those instantly
whenever i want and meditation is a way
to start training your mind to do that
and there's lots of different kinds of
meditation
i use observational meditation almost
exclusively for myself
i do do a few other meditations and and
before this series is done we'll
probably get into a few other
meditations but
meditation is there purposefully to
build the mind just like calisthenics
are there purposefully to build the body
so
you have to look at this as a mental
exercise in some ways the five-minute
meditation to me is harder
than a longer meditation because i have
to instantly get where i want to get
right
and if i don't instantly get there then
i tend to tell myself like oh you're
doing bad
and then that's more that i
don't want right so whereas a 30 minute
meditation i can just kind of like ease
into it and then
before long i'm in the space and
everything's cool but in a five minute
meditation
there's more pressure on me a lot of
times to get to where i need to be
and this should be if i could let go of
that pressure i would be better at
meditating
but that's the catch 22 of the whole
thing so uh the meditation
is is is awesome and fun and relaxing i
guess it can be
um but to me it's it's mentally taxing
it's the same as when i tax my body and
i feel about the same mentally fatigued
as i do
physically fatigued after that exercise
okay guys so we'll see you
next tuesday right around 7 a.m have a
wonderful day talk to you later
