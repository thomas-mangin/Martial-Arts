so posture is a bad word we say here

120
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:10,950
so posture is a bad word we say here

organization organize your body for the
internal aspect so why is posture bad

124
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:17,489
internal aspect so why is posture bad
 

125
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,430

okay so if I keep good posture I can't

142
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,580
okay so if I keep good posture I can't
 

143
