1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,230

i'd like to take a minute to talk about

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
i'd like to take a minute to talk about
 

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,150
i'd like to take a minute to talk about
martial arts systems and what they are

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
martial arts systems and what they are
 

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,310
martial arts systems and what they are
there's a lot of con confusion about

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
there's a lot of con confusion about
 

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,549
there's a lot of con confusion about
what martial arts systems are and that

8
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
what martial arts systems are and that
 

9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,990
what martial arts systems are and that
confusion

10
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
confusion
 

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,190
confusion
makes it very difficult for people to

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
makes it very difficult for people to
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,390
makes it very difficult for people to
actually study the martial arts so

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
actually study the martial arts so
 

15
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,070
actually study the martial arts so
you have to understand that a system is

16
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
you have to understand that a system is
 

17
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,429
you have to understand that a system is
a framework that's designed to help you

18
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
a framework that's designed to help you
 

19
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,710
a framework that's designed to help you
look at and understand an aspect

20
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
look at and understand an aspect
 

21
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,870
look at and understand an aspect
of conflict

22
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
of conflict
 

23
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,870
of conflict
so uh

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
so uh
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,270
so uh
when you're looking at a system its job

26
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
when you're looking at a system its job
 

27
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,229
when you're looking at a system its job
is basically to teach you about aspects

28
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
is basically to teach you about aspects
 

29
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,229
is basically to teach you about aspects
of conflict certain aspects of conflict

30
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
of conflict certain aspects of conflict
 

31
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,630
of conflict certain aspects of conflict
and depending on what the system is uh

32
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
and depending on what the system is uh
 

33
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,030
and depending on what the system is uh
is is what aspects it will teach right

34
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
is is what aspects it will teach right
 

35
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,029
is is what aspects it will teach right
so for example western boxing will teach

36
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
so for example western boxing will teach
 

37
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,790
so for example western boxing will teach
you

38
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
you
 

39
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,029
you
methods for defending against and

40
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
methods for defending against and
 

41
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,150
methods for defending against and
attacking

42
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
attacking
 

43
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,790
attacking
unarmed in a striking context with the

44
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
unarmed in a striking context with the
 

45
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,470
unarmed in a striking context with the
upper body only right or with the hands

46
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
upper body only right or with the hands
 

47
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,630
upper body only right or with the hands
only specifically

48
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
only specifically
 

49
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,869
only specifically
a kickboxing system will add to that and

50
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
a kickboxing system will add to that and
 

51
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,869
a kickboxing system will add to that and
teach you something about uh using your

52
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
teach you something about uh using your
 

53
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,470
teach you something about uh using your
legs and kicking and defending against

54
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
legs and kicking and defending against
 

55
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,869
legs and kicking and defending against
kicks um a grappling system will teach

56
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
kicks um a grappling system will teach
 

57
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,390
kicks um a grappling system will teach
you about methods to wrestle and

58
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
you about methods to wrestle and
 

59
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,590
you about methods to wrestle and
different grappling systems will teach

60
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
different grappling systems will teach
 

61
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,630
different grappling systems will teach
you different kinds of things and

62
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
you different kinds of things and
 

63
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,950
you different kinds of things and
different ways you might grapple

64
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
different ways you might grapple
 

65
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,030
different ways you might grapple
so the system's designed to illustrate

66
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
so the system's designed to illustrate
 

67
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,550
so the system's designed to illustrate
for you and give you a framework to work

68
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
for you and give you a framework to work
 

69
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,030
for you and give you a framework to work
with aspects of a part of fighting

70
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
with aspects of a part of fighting
 

71
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,550
with aspects of a part of fighting
and so that's all the system really is

72
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
and so that's all the system really is
 

73
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,350
and so that's all the system really is
it it's to help you get better and to

74
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
it it's to help you get better and to
 

75
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,670
it it's to help you get better and to
understand an aspect of fighting

76
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
understand an aspect of fighting
 

77
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,990
understand an aspect of fighting
but when people look at systems they

78
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
but when people look at systems they
 

79
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,149
but when people look at systems they
they think that the system

80
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
they think that the system
 

81
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,870
they think that the system
is the event right and so by by is the

82
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
is the event right and so by by is the
 

83
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,789
is the event right and so by by is the
event what i mean is either the system

84
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
event what i mean is either the system
 

85
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,590
event what i mean is either the system
is the fight right so like this system

86
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
is the fight right so like this system
 

87
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,429
is the fight right so like this system
is the way fighting is and that's not

88
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
is the way fighting is and that's not
 

89
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,590
is the way fighting is and that's not
true of any system

90
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
true of any system
 

91
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,590
true of any system
the only exception may be being a sports

92
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
the only exception may be being a sports
 

93
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,310
the only exception may be being a sports
system that teaches to the sport which

94
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
system that teaches to the sport which
 

95
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,550
system that teaches to the sport which
the sport is the method you're looking

96
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
the sport is the method you're looking
 

97
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,190
the sport is the method you're looking
at but outside of sport fighting

98
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
at but outside of sport fighting
 

99
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,870
at but outside of sport fighting
there is no system that can teach you

100
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
there is no system that can teach you
 

101
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,469
there is no system that can teach you
what is fighting because it's always

102
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
what is fighting because it's always
 

103
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,990
what is fighting because it's always
changing and adapting and evolving

104
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
changing and adapting and evolving
 

105
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,910
changing and adapting and evolving
depending on the situation right where

106
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
depending on the situation right where
 

107
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,469
depending on the situation right where
you're at who the people are uh what we

108
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
you're at who the people are uh what we
 

109
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,230
you're at who the people are uh what we
have available to us stuff like that so

110
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
have available to us stuff like that so
 

111
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,069
have available to us stuff like that so
it's always changing so no system can

112
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
it's always changing so no system can
 

113
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,310
it's always changing so no system can
really teach you what fighting is

114
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
really teach you what fighting is
 

115
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,070
really teach you what fighting is
or people think that a martial arts

116
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
or people think that a martial arts
 

117
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,830
or people think that a martial arts
system is the event because they think

118
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
system is the event because they think
 

119
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,949
system is the event because they think
somehow that

120
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
somehow that
 

121
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,630
somehow that
the martial art is a person or something

122
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
the martial art is a person or something
 

123
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,110
the martial art is a person or something
or that if you if you train enough in

124
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
or that if you if you train enough in
 

125
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,110
or that if you if you train enough in
the martial art you 100 can represent

126
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
the martial art you 100 can represent
 

127
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,270
the martial art you 100 can represent
what that system is and and that's not

128
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
what that system is and and that's not
 

129
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,949
what that system is and and that's not
true either right so

130
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
true either right so
 

131
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,270
true either right so
systems can only give you ideas and help

132
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
systems can only give you ideas and help
 

133
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,070
systems can only give you ideas and help
you look at uh an aspect of of the

134
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
you look at uh an aspect of of the
 

135
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,910
you look at uh an aspect of of the
conflict and they can't they aren't the

136
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
conflict and they can't they aren't the
 

137
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,229
conflict and they can't they aren't the
conflict themselves and they can't stand

138
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
conflict themselves and they can't stand
 

139
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,309
conflict themselves and they can't stand
up for themselves right so you know if

140
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
up for themselves right so you know if
 

141
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,710
up for themselves right so you know if
you wanted to compare uh western

142
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
you wanted to compare uh western
 

143
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,309
you wanted to compare uh western
wrestling in western boxing and you put

144
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
wrestling in western boxing and you put
 

145
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,070
wrestling in western boxing and you put
them together there's going to be

146
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
them together there's going to be
 

147
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,430
them together there's going to be
strengths and weaknesses of the two

148
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
strengths and weaknesses of the two
 

149
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,030
strengths and weaknesses of the two
people there's always the medium of the

150
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
people there's always the medium of the
 

151
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,550
people there's always the medium of the
person that the system has to go through

152
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
person that the system has to go through
 

153
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,710
person that the system has to go through
so you really can never compare uh

154
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
so you really can never compare uh
 

155
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,470
so you really can never compare uh
western boxing and western wrestling

156
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
western boxing and western wrestling
 

157
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,470
western boxing and western wrestling
they they can't they can't compare them

158
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
they they can't they can't compare them
 

159
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,910
they they can't they can't compare them
directly because there's the medium of a

160
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
directly because there's the medium of a
 

161
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,270
directly because there's the medium of a
person and the media the person is the

162
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
person and the media the person is the
 

163
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,270
person and the media the person is the
important thing right the the system is

164
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
important thing right the the system is
 

165
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,270
important thing right the the system is
designed to teach you something the

166
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
designed to teach you something the
 

167
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,589
designed to teach you something the
person who's studying it something but

168
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
person who's studying it something but
 

169
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,790
person who's studying it something but
the important thing is to understand the

170
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
the important thing is to understand the
 

171
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,030
the important thing is to understand the
system is not the event the system is

172
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
system is not the event the system is
 

173
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,869
system is not the event the system is
not the person who does the fighting and

174
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
not the person who does the fighting and
 

175
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,110
not the person who does the fighting and
it is not the fight it's just a

176
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
it is not the fight it's just a
 

177
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,869
it is not the fight it's just a
framework that you can work with and

178
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
framework that you can work with and
 

179
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,309
framework that you can work with and
help you to understand a part of a fight

180
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
help you to understand a part of a fight
 

181
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,270
help you to understand a part of a fight
so

182
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
so
 

183
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,350
so
so what is the system and what does the

184
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
so what is the system and what does the
 

185
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,710
so what is the system and what does the
system do basically martial arts systems

186
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
system do basically martial arts systems
 

187
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,589
system do basically martial arts systems
they take a an aspect of fighting and

188
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
they take a an aspect of fighting and
 

189
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,710
they take a an aspect of fighting and
they give you

190
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
they give you
 

191
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,110
they give you
something to work with in in that aspect

192
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
something to work with in in that aspect
 

193
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,350
something to work with in in that aspect
um and it's really hard the system

194
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
um and it's really hard the system
 

195
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,789
um and it's really hard the system
becomes really

196
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
becomes really
 

197
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,390
becomes really
complicated and a lot becomes involved

198
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
complicated and a lot becomes involved
 

199
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,229
complicated and a lot becomes involved
the more things we add to the system so

200
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
the more things we add to the system so
 

201
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,750
the more things we add to the system so
it's almost impossible it probably is

202
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
it's almost impossible it probably is
 

203
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,190
it's almost impossible it probably is
completely impossible to have an

204
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
completely impossible to have an
 

205
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,789
completely impossible to have an
absolutely complete martial arts system

206
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
absolutely complete martial arts system
 

207
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,910
absolutely complete martial arts system
that looks at all aspects of conflict

208
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
that looks at all aspects of conflict
 

209
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,390
that looks at all aspects of conflict
next conflict's a huge huge category um

210
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
next conflict's a huge huge category um
 

211
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,070
next conflict's a huge huge category um
and even if you get into physical

212
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
and even if you get into physical
 

213
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,110
and even if you get into physical
conflict only you want to look at

214
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
conflict only you want to look at
 

215
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,110
conflict only you want to look at
physical conflict it's also a huge

216
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
physical conflict it's also a huge
 

217
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,630
physical conflict it's also a huge
subject matter right

218
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
subject matter right
 

219
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,869
subject matter right
um it's huge because not only do you

220
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
um it's huge because not only do you
 

221
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,509
um it's huge because not only do you
have to understand um all the unarmed

222
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
have to understand um all the unarmed
 

223
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,110
have to understand um all the unarmed
methods of doing things right so like

224
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
methods of doing things right so like
 

225
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,309
methods of doing things right so like
all the ways to use your body and that

226
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
all the ways to use your body and that
 

227
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,830
all the ways to use your body and that
would be huge that would be a gigantic

228
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
would be huge that would be a gigantic
 

229
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,350
would be huge that would be a gigantic
system in and of itself like all the

230
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
system in and of itself like all the
 

231
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,229
system in and of itself like all the
ways to punch and kick and strike and

232
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
ways to punch and kick and strike and
 

233
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,390
ways to punch and kick and strike and
things will include biting and clawing

234
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
things will include biting and clawing
 

235
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,830
things will include biting and clawing
and all the things that might be useful

236
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
and all the things that might be useful
 

237
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,429
and all the things that might be useful
to fighting would have to be in in that

238
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
to fighting would have to be in in that
 

239
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,030
to fighting would have to be in in that
system then we have to add all the

240
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
system then we have to add all the
 

241
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,869
system then we have to add all the
aspects of weapon training right and so

242
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
aspects of weapon training right and so
 

243
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,710
aspects of weapon training right and so
you could have basic handheld weapons

244
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
you could have basic handheld weapons
 

245
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,309
you could have basic handheld weapons
and that would be in and of itself a

246
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
and that would be in and of itself a
 

247
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,070
and that would be in and of itself a
huge category you know everything doing

248
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
huge category you know everything doing
 

249
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,990
huge category you know everything doing
with uh clubs and everything to do with

250
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
with uh clubs and everything to do with
 

251
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,590
with uh clubs and everything to do with
blades and

252
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
blades and
 

253
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,509
blades and
projectile weaponry all these things

254
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
projectile weaponry all these things
 

255
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,789
projectile weaponry all these things
that would all have to be included and

256
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
that would all have to be included and
 

257
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,629
that would all have to be included and
that would be that would be a big system

258
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
that would be that would be a big system
 

259
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,070
that would be that would be a big system
and then you would also have to start to

260
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
and then you would also have to start to
 

261
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,510
and then you would also have to start to
include other things that we use in

262
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
include other things that we use in
 

263
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,830
include other things that we use in
conflict right so people use helicopters

264
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
conflict right so people use helicopters
 

265
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,909
conflict right so people use helicopters
in conflict people use horses and

266
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
in conflict people use horses and
 

267
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,590
in conflict people use horses and
conflict we use all kinds of things and

268
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
conflict we use all kinds of things and
 

269
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
conflict we use all kinds of things and
and saying horses that there's another

270
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
and saying horses that there's another
 

271
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,790
and saying horses that there's another
aspect we'd have to include in that

272
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
aspect we'd have to include in that
 

273
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,110
aspect we'd have to include in that
which is you know historical elements um

274
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
which is you know historical elements um
 

275
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,310
which is you know historical elements um
so do you want to look at things from

276
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
so do you want to look at things from
 

277
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,310
so do you want to look at things from
the past and things from the modern day

278
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
the past and things from the modern day
 

279
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,230
the past and things from the modern day
so a complete martial arts system would

280
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
so a complete martial arts system would
 

281
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,230
so a complete martial arts system would
would probably be impossible because it

282
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
would probably be impossible because it
 

283
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,230
would probably be impossible because it
would involve too much

284
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
would involve too much
 

285
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,310
would involve too much
so what we do really simply is we break

286
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
so what we do really simply is we break
 

287
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,070
so what we do really simply is we break
down aspects of fighting and we put them

288
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
down aspects of fighting and we put them
 

289
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,830
down aspects of fighting and we put them
in systems and people who are interested

290
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
in systems and people who are interested
 

291
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,189
in systems and people who are interested
in setting the different aspects can

292
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
in setting the different aspects can
 

293
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,950
in setting the different aspects can
just go to the other smaller systems and

294
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
just go to the other smaller systems and
 

295
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,550
just go to the other smaller systems and
study what that's about right the

296
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
study what that's about right the
 

297
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,230
study what that's about right the
military has really nice ways of looking

298
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
military has really nice ways of looking
 

299
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,390
military has really nice ways of looking
at this you know if you you look at what

300
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
at this you know if you you look at what
 

301
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,830
at this you know if you you look at what
someone does in the military you know

302
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
someone does in the military you know
 

303
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,629
someone does in the military you know
maybe they studied uh in an escape and

304
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
maybe they studied uh in an escape and
 

305
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,710
maybe they studied uh in an escape and
evasion school and then they studied in

306
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
evasion school and then they studied in
 

307
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,510
evasion school and then they studied in
a sniper school and they took martial

308
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
a sniper school and they took martial
 

309
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,590
a sniper school and they took martial
art hand-to-hand combatives you know you

310
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
art hand-to-hand combatives you know you
 

311
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,189
art hand-to-hand combatives you know you
can see that they picked out all these

312
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
can see that they picked out all these
 

313
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,550
can see that they picked out all these
things for what they want to do or you

314
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
things for what they want to do or you
 

315
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,990
things for what they want to do or you
know communications i mean that's an

316
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
know communications i mean that's an
 

317
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,909
know communications i mean that's an
aspect of conflict um lots of different

318
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
aspect of conflict um lots of different
 

319
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,950
aspect of conflict um lots of different
parts

320
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
parts
 

321
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,029
parts
um that they can pick and choose to

322
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
um that they can pick and choose to
 

323
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,270
um that they can pick and choose to
comprise what they want to do so you

324
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
comprise what they want to do so you
 

325
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,950
comprise what they want to do so you
study the system not to become the

326
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
study the system not to become the
 

327
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,870
study the system not to become the
ultimate complete warrior in the world

328
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
ultimate complete warrior in the world
 

329
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,110
ultimate complete warrior in the world
but instead to

330
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
but instead to
 

331
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,790
but instead to
improve yourself in those different

332
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
improve yourself in those different
 

333
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,990
improve yourself in those different
aspects of of what the martial arts are

334
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
aspects of of what the martial arts are
 

335
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,070
aspects of of what the martial arts are
right so the different aspects the first

336
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
right so the different aspects the first
 

337
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,110
right so the different aspects the first
part is the context for the system so

338
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
part is the context for the system so
 

339
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,629
part is the context for the system so
that's the dominating factor of the

340
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
that's the dominating factor of the
 

341
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,430
that's the dominating factor of the
system the context is what are we going

342
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
system the context is what are we going
 

343
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,110
system the context is what are we going
to do with this system so it could be um

344
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
to do with this system so it could be um
 

345
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,550
to do with this system so it could be um
knife fighting for example we could

346
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
knife fighting for example we could
 

347
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,749
knife fighting for example we could
knife fighting could be our system

348
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
knife fighting could be our system
 

349
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,029
knife fighting could be our system
that's our context we're only going to

350
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
that's our context we're only going to
 

351
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,629
that's our context we're only going to
look at knife fighting and it does need

352
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
look at knife fighting and it does need
 

353
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,510
look at knife fighting and it does need
to be

354
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
to be
 

355
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,590
to be
a little more simplified most likely to

356
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
a little more simplified most likely to
 

357
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,270
a little more simplified most likely to
make a good system uh because i mean you

358
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
make a good system uh because i mean you
 

359
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,790
make a good system uh because i mean you
could just have the whole world of knife

360
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
could just have the whole world of knife
 

361
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,070
could just have the whole world of knife
fighting but that includes a lot of

362
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
fighting but that includes a lot of
 

363
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,390
fighting but that includes a lot of
things like different size knives

364
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
things like different size knives
 

365
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,990
things like different size knives
all kinds of stuff has to be involved in

366
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
all kinds of stuff has to be involved in
 

367
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,309
all kinds of stuff has to be involved in
that so we'll say we're going to look at

368
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
that so we'll say we're going to look at
 

369
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,830
that so we'll say we're going to look at
a system for knife fighting that is uh

370
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
a system for knife fighting that is uh
 

371
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,670
a system for knife fighting that is uh
armed versus unarmed i'm always going to

372
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
armed versus unarmed i'm always going to
 

373
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,950
armed versus unarmed i'm always going to
be armed right so we're looking at a

374
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
be armed right so we're looking at a
 

375
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,070
be armed right so we're looking at a
system where i'm always going to have a

376
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
system where i'm always going to have a
 

377
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,029
system where i'm always going to have a
knife

378
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
knife
 

379
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,230
knife
and other people aren't going to have a

380
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
and other people aren't going to have a
 

381
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,749
and other people aren't going to have a
knife and i'm fighting them and of

382
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
knife and i'm fighting them and of
 

383
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,110
knife and i'm fighting them and of
course that could be one-on-one or

384
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
course that could be one-on-one or
 

385
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,469
course that could be one-on-one or
multiple attackers i could be looking at

386
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
multiple attackers i could be looking at
 

387
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,309
multiple attackers i could be looking at
all kinds of aspects it could be in the

388
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
all kinds of aspects it could be in the
 

389
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,230
all kinds of aspects it could be in the
dark it could be you know in crazy

390
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
dark it could be you know in crazy
 

391
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,670
dark it could be you know in crazy
environments you know we could be in the

392
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
environments you know we could be in the
 

393
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,110
environments you know we could be in the
water or whatever who knows why i want

394
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
water or whatever who knows why i want
 

395
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,029
water or whatever who knows why i want
my system but that's the first part is

396
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
my system but that's the first part is
 

397
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,110
my system but that's the first part is
the context right so if we have a knife

398
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
the context right so if we have a knife
 

399
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,070
the context right so if we have a knife
fighting

400
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
fighting
 

401
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,150
fighting
and each context is going to be specific

402
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
and each context is going to be specific
 

403
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,590
and each context is going to be specific
to the martial arts system right so

404
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
to the martial arts system right so
 

405
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,150
to the martial arts system right so
there's rifle context there's helicopter

406
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
there's rifle context there's helicopter
 

407
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,550
there's rifle context there's helicopter
context there's unarmed context there's

408
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
context there's unarmed context there's
 

409
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,950
context there's unarmed context there's
kicking contests and wrestling contexts

410
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
kicking contests and wrestling contexts
 

411
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,629
kicking contests and wrestling contexts
all kinds of contexts but that's the

412
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
all kinds of contexts but that's the
 

413
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,070
all kinds of contexts but that's the
first part of our system the first part

414
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
first part of our system the first part
 

415
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,230
first part of our system the first part
we need is what is our context what is

416
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
we need is what is our context what is
 

417
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,309
we need is what is our context what is
the system to do

418
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
the system to do
 

419
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,350
the system to do
the next is theory of use so theory of

420
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
the next is theory of use so theory of
 

421
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,070
the next is theory of use so theory of
use is what we're going to do within

422
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
use is what we're going to do within
 

423
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,749
use is what we're going to do within
that context right so for example if

424
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
that context right so for example if
 

425
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,589
that context right so for example if
we're looking at our knife system i

426
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
we're looking at our knife system i
 

427
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,430
we're looking at our knife system i
could have a defensive theory of use

428
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
could have a defensive theory of use
 

429
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,909
could have a defensive theory of use
which maybe i uh always keep the knife

430
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
which maybe i uh always keep the knife
 

431
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,589
which maybe i uh always keep the knife
in the reverse grip and i keep it in the

432
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
in the reverse grip and i keep it in the
 

433
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,830
in the reverse grip and i keep it in the
back hand i use my my front hand here to

434
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
back hand i use my my front hand here to
 

435
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,350
back hand i use my my front hand here to
push people away from me and when they

436
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
push people away from me and when they
 

437
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,270
push people away from me and when they
get close i can use my knife

438
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
get close i can use my knife
 

439
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,670
get close i can use my knife
in a powerful hammer motion uh to attack

440
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
in a powerful hammer motion uh to attack
 

441
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,110
in a powerful hammer motion uh to attack
them right so that would be a defensive

442
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
them right so that would be a defensive
 

443
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,870
them right so that would be a defensive
theory for our knife fighting system i

444
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
theory for our knife fighting system i
 

445
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,550
theory for our knife fighting system i
could have an offensive theory right

446
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
could have an offensive theory right
 

447
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,150
could have an offensive theory right
whereas like i'm going to keep my knife

448
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
whereas like i'm going to keep my knife
 

449
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,150
whereas like i'm going to keep my knife
in the foregrip and the forehand so that

450
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
in the foregrip and the forehand so that
 

451
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,670
in the foregrip and the forehand so that
way anyone comes at me i'm going to

452
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
way anyone comes at me i'm going to
 

453
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,029
way anyone comes at me i'm going to
attack them and i'm going to be marching

454
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
attack them and i'm going to be marching
 

455
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,390
attack them and i'm going to be marching
towards people and i'm not going to be

456
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
towards people and i'm not going to be
 

457
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,749
towards people and i'm not going to be
in a defensive posture at all i'm going

458
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
in a defensive posture at all i'm going
 

459
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,110
in a defensive posture at all i'm going
to be attacking

460
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
to be attacking
 

461
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,629
to be attacking
so there's lots of lots of theories of

462
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
so there's lots of lots of theories of
 

463
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,550
so there's lots of lots of theories of
use i could have so our first part is

464
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
use i could have so our first part is
 

465
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,189
use i could have so our first part is
context how are we what's a system for

466
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
context how are we what's a system for
 

467
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,950
context how are we what's a system for
the second part is how are we going to

468
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
the second part is how are we going to
 

469
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,110
the second part is how are we going to
use the system within that context so

470
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
use the system within that context so
 

471
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,270
use the system within that context so
what's our our outlook on

472
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
what's our our outlook on
 

473
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,469
what's our our outlook on
um

474
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
um
 

475
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,830
um
on the the context itself um and then

476
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
on the the context itself um and then
 

477
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,670
on the the context itself um and then
the next and this is really the last

478
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
the next and this is really the last
 

479
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,909
the next and this is really the last
step of all um

480
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
step of all um
 

481
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,790
step of all um
systems is how are we going to teach

482
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
systems is how are we going to teach
 

483
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,029
systems is how are we going to teach
those things to people right so how are

484
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
those things to people right so how are
 

485
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,110
those things to people right so how are
we going to transmit the knowledge so

486
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
we going to transmit the knowledge so
 

487
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,270
we going to transmit the knowledge so
first step is context second steps

488
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
first step is context second steps
 

489
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,510
first step is context second steps
theory of use third step is transmission

490
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
theory of use third step is transmission
 

491
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,510
theory of use third step is transmission
so how are we going to transmit what we

492
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
so how are we going to transmit what we
 

493
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,230
so how are we going to transmit what we
know about the about this this idea of

494
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
know about the about this this idea of
 

495
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,670
know about the about this this idea of
this this context to other people so

496
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
this this context to other people so
 

497
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,510
this this context to other people so
um and that would be stuff like uh

498
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
um and that would be stuff like uh
 

499
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,950
um and that would be stuff like uh
physical exercise we're going to do the

500
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
physical exercise we're going to do the
 

501
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,550
physical exercise we're going to do the
kind of conditioning people have to be

502
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
kind of conditioning people have to be
 

503

biceps do you have to you know what are

510
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
biceps do you have to you know what are
 

511
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,790
biceps do you have to you know what are
what are the physical requirements for

512
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
what are the physical requirements for
 

513
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,990
what are the physical requirements for
that system so that's going to be in it

514
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
that system so that's going to be in it
 

515
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,749
that system so that's going to be in it
the exercises we need to do

516
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
the exercises we need to do
 

517
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,350
the exercises we need to do
how we actually get the ideas across

518
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
how we actually get the ideas across
 

519
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,790
how we actually get the ideas across
right so in a lot of traditional

520
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
right so in a lot of traditional
 

521
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,950
right so in a lot of traditional

we're gonna this form we're gonna

526
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
we're gonna this form we're gonna
 

527
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,589
we're gonna this form we're gonna
memorize this form and by memorizing

this form we're gonna learn the things
 

531
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,149
this form we're gonna learn the things
that go into this right we're gonna

532
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
that go into this right we're gonna
 

533
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,670
that go into this right we're gonna
understand the theory of use and how we

534
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
understand the theory of use and how we
 

535
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,550
understand the theory of use and how we
use the weapon and all the little

536
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
use the weapon and all the little
 

537

technical details through kata
 

539
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,190
technical details through kata
a modern idea that's really appearing a

540
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
a modern idea that's really appearing a
 

541
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,750
a modern idea that's really appearing a
lot now is this idea of live training so

542
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
lot now is this idea of live training so
 

543
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,949
lot now is this idea of live training so
we're just going to put you in that

544
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
we're just going to put you in that
 

545
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,509
we're just going to put you in that
context sport martial arts do this a lot

546
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
context sport martial arts do this a lot
 

547
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,470
context sport martial arts do this a lot
you know i'm just going to put you

548
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
you know i'm just going to put you
 

549
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,389
you know i'm just going to put you
inside that context and you're going to

550
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
inside that context and you're going to
 

551
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,990
inside that context and you're going to
scramble around and see what happens and

552
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
scramble around and see what happens and
 

553
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,590
scramble around and see what happens and
we'll give you some ideas here and there

554
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
we'll give you some ideas here and there
 

555
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,870
we'll give you some ideas here and there
from people who have been there

556
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
from people who have been there
 

557
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,310
from people who have been there
themselves and that's it that's what

558
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
themselves and that's it that's what
 

559
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,750
themselves and that's it that's what
we're going to do so there's lots of

560
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
we're going to do so there's lots of
 

561
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,230
we're going to do so there's lots of
ways we can transmit

562
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
ways we can transmit
 

563
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,910
ways we can transmit
the things we know about it so there's

564
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
the things we know about it so there's
 

565
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,310
the things we know about it so there's
three parts to a system the first part

566
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
three parts to a system the first part
 

567
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,389
three parts to a system the first part
of the context of the system the second

568
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
of the context of the system the second
 

569
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,949
of the context of the system the second
part is the theory of use within that

570
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
part is the theory of use within that
 

571
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,310
part is the theory of use within that
context and the third part is

572
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
context and the third part is
 

573
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,030
context and the third part is
transmission of the information

574
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
transmission of the information
 

575
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,350
transmission of the information
within that context so basically i want

576
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
within that context so basically i want
 

577
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,150
within that context so basically i want
to make this video

578
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
to make this video
 

579
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,310
to make this video
so we could start to talk about what

580
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
so we could start to talk about what
 

581
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,750
so we could start to talk about what
martial arts systems really are as

582
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
martial arts systems really are as
 

583
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,350
martial arts systems really are as
opposed to having this

584
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
opposed to having this
 

585
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,030
opposed to having this
kind of crazy idea the martial arts

586
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
kind of crazy idea the martial arts
 

587
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,630
kind of crazy idea the martial arts
system itself is some kind of magical

588
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
system itself is some kind of magical
 

589
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,389
system itself is some kind of magical
thing it's either going to make you an

590
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
thing it's either going to make you an
 

591
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,269
thing it's either going to make you an
ultimate invincible warrior or that it

592
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
ultimate invincible warrior or that it
 

593
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,030
ultimate invincible warrior or that it
uh can get up and fight on its own or

594
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
uh can get up and fight on its own or
 

595
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,990
uh can get up and fight on its own or
that once you know it you're

596
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
that once you know it you're
 

597
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,750
that once you know it you're
undefeatable or who knows you have lots

598
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
undefeatable or who knows you have lots
 

599
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,990
undefeatable or who knows you have lots
of crazy ideas about what systems are

600
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
of crazy ideas about what systems are
 

601
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,750
of crazy ideas about what systems are
but this the truth is the system's

602
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
but this the truth is the system's
 

603
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,150
but this the truth is the system's
really nice thing to to look at to help

604
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
really nice thing to to look at to help
 

605
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,269
really nice thing to to look at to help
you understand an aspect of conflict and

606
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
you understand an aspect of conflict and
 

607
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,630
you understand an aspect of conflict and
as martial artists that's what we study

608
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
as martial artists that's what we study
 

609
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,550
as martial artists that's what we study
we study conflicts so uh understanding

610
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
we study conflicts so uh understanding
 

611
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,230
we study conflicts so uh understanding
different systems and how they work and

612
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
different systems and how they work and
 

613
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,470
different systems and how they work and
how you wanna to use them and implement

614
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
how you wanna to use them and implement
 

615
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,190
how you wanna to use them and implement
them is very important you know if uh if

616
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
them is very important you know if uh if
 

617
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,630
them is very important you know if uh if
you're looking at yourself in some

618
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
you're looking at yourself in some
 

619
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,630
you're looking at yourself in some
situation you know so you know you

620
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
situation you know so you know you
 

621
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,069
situation you know so you know you
regularly get beat up by the

622
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
regularly get beat up by the
 

623
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,509
regularly get beat up by the
neighborhood kids and how are you going

624
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
neighborhood kids and how are you going
 

625
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,590
neighborhood kids and how are you going
to stop that um

626
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
to stop that um
 

627
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,310
to stop that um
well they usually um they punch me so

628
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
well they usually um they punch me so
 

629
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,470
well they usually um they punch me so
well first thing i guess i need to do is

630
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
well first thing i guess i need to do is
 

631
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,750
well first thing i guess i need to do is
to learn how to defend myself against

632
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
to learn how to defend myself against
 

633
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,069
to learn how to defend myself against
punches so oh i should look at a system

634
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
punches so oh i should look at a system
 

635
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,350
punches so oh i should look at a system
that talks about defending against

636
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
that talks about defending against
 

637
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,190
that talks about defending against
punches right so western boxing probably

638
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
punches right so western boxing probably
 

639
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,030
punches right so western boxing probably
a great system to study to learn how to

640
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
a great system to study to learn how to
 

641
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,710
a great system to study to learn how to
defend against those punches and then

642
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
defend against those punches and then
 

643
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,910
defend against those punches and then
you keep getting in a fight with those

644
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
you keep getting in a fight with those
 

645
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,350
you keep getting in a fight with those
kids and they don't hurt you as much

646
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
kids and they don't hurt you as much
 

647
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,110
kids and they don't hurt you as much
anymore but you really can't do anything

648
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
anymore but you really can't do anything
 

649
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,470
anymore but you really can't do anything
to stop them so it's like well then how

650
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
to stop them so it's like well then how
 

651
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,829
to stop them so it's like well then how
can i stop things like and you start

652
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
can i stop things like and you start
 

653
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,190
can i stop things like and you start
