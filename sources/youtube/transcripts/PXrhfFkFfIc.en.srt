00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,550

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine. Today I'm

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine. Today I'm
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,230
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine. Today I'm
going to talk about how to make your

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,240
going to talk about how to make your
 

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,750
going to talk about how to make your
good. So, real simple. Um, I think idiag

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
good. So, real simple. Um, I think idiag
 

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,589
good. So, real simple. Um, I think idiag
is super tricky. I've talked about edit

8
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
is super tricky. I've talked about edit
 

9
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,790
is super tricky. I've talked about edit
in the past, but I want to talk about

10
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:12,800
in the past, but I want to talk about
 

11
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,350
in the past, but I want to talk about
the classic idi that you see, the really

12
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
the classic idi that you see, the really
 

13
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,710
the classic idi that you see, the really
big pretty one where there's a bunch of

14
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
big pretty one where there's a bunch of
 

15
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,429
big pretty one where there's a bunch of
movement and everything happens. That

16
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
movement and everything happens. That
 

17
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,710
movement and everything happens. That
mag is is really deceptively simple. And

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
mag is is really deceptively simple. And
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,230
mag is is really deceptively simple. And
deceptively simple because I've seen all

20
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
deceptively simple because I've seen all
 

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,070
deceptively simple because I've seen all
kinds of horrible variations of that.

22
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
kinds of horrible variations of that.
 

23
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,310
kinds of horrible variations of that.
Took me years of working on it to really

24
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
Took me years of working on it to really
 

25
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,910
Took me years of working on it to really
figure out what it's doing. And it's

26
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
figure out what it's doing. And it's
 

27
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,750
figure out what it's doing. And it's
really simple. So I'm going to talk

28
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
really simple. So I'm going to talk
 

29
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,830
really simple. So I'm going to talk
about that to you guys with Josh today.

30
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
about that to you guys with Josh today.
 

31
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,389
about that to you guys with Josh today.
Josh.

32
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399

 

33
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,430

All right. So let's talk about edit and

34
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
All right. So let's talk about edit and
 

35
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,670
All right. So let's talk about edit and
the uh shocking simplicity of it. So uh

36
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
the uh shocking simplicity of it. So uh
 

37
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,869
the uh shocking simplicity of it. So uh
I've talked about this a little bit

38
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
I've talked about this a little bit
 

39
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,549
I've talked about this a little bit
before, but let's really talk about

40
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
before, but let's really talk about
 

41
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,549
before, but let's really talk about
edimi and what's happening. So if I get

42
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
edimi and what's happening. So if I get
 

43
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,110
edimi and what's happening. So if I get
edimi, right, which is hard to get, but

44
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
edimi, right, which is hard to get, but
 

45
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,229
edimi, right, which is hard to get, but
if I get edi, I want to maximize my edi

46
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
if I get edi, I want to maximize my edi
 

47
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,670
if I get edi, I want to maximize my edi
time. Now, edimi nag is a way to deal

48
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
time. Now, edimi nag is a way to deal
 

49
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,910
time. Now, edimi nag is a way to deal
with someone who's trying to minimize

50
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
with someone who's trying to minimize
 

51
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,229
with someone who's trying to minimize
your edi time, but there's a real simple

52
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
your edi time, but there's a real simple
 

53
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,830
your edi time, but there's a real simple
way to to get it in the beginning. Okay?

54
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
way to to get it in the beginning. Okay?
 

55
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,109
way to to get it in the beginning. Okay?
So, look, if I'm going by Josh eating me

56
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
So, look, if I'm going by Josh eating me
 

57
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,469
So, look, if I'm going by Josh eating me
this way, and Josh wants to follow me,

58
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
this way, and Josh wants to follow me,
 

59
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,670
this way, and Josh wants to follow me,
he's going to follow me from the

60
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
he's going to follow me from the
 

61
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,270
he's going to follow me from the
direction I came from. So, if I go this

62
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
direction I came from. So, if I go this
 

63
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,109
direction I came from. So, if I go this
way, he's going to follow me like that

64
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
way, he's going to follow me like that
 

65
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,830
way, he's going to follow me like that
as as I escape, right? Okay. So, that

66
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
as as I escape, right? Okay. So, that
 

67
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,109
as as I escape, right? Okay. So, that
means if I shoot a straight line,

68
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
means if I shoot a straight line,
 

69
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,710
means if I shoot a straight line,
basically once I'm past Josh, if he's

70
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
basically once I'm past Josh, if he's
 

71
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,149
basically once I'm past Josh, if he's
turning, he's going to be right behind

72
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
turning, he's going to be right behind
 

73
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,350
turning, he's going to be right behind
me. So, what I want to do is I

74
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
me. So, what I want to do is I
 

75
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,950
me. So, what I want to do is I
constantly want to move at an angle

76
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
constantly want to move at an angle
 

77
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,749
constantly want to move at an angle
behind Josh. And this will make it

78
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
behind Josh. And this will make it
 

79
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,749
behind Josh. And this will make it
harder for him to pick me up, right? So,

80
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
harder for him to pick me up, right? So,
 

81
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,910
harder for him to pick me up, right? So,
if I'm moving, right, and we'll just go

82
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
if I'm moving, right, and we'll just go
 

83
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,469
if I'm moving, right, and we'll just go
step for step, right? So, I step and

84
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
step for step, right? So, I step and
 

85
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,630
step for step, right? So, I step and
Josh starts turning and I step and Josh

86
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
Josh starts turning and I step and Josh
 

87
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,310
Josh starts turning and I step and Josh
starts turning and I step and Josh

88
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
starts turning and I step and Josh
 

89
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,830
starts turning and I step and Josh
starts turning and I step and Josh

90
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
starts turning and I step and Josh
 

91
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,190
starts turning and I step and Josh
starts turning. You can see I stayed

92
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200

 

93
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,469

either going fast, it's not going to be

94
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
either going fast, it's not going to be
 

95
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,630
either going fast, it's not going to be
that step for step for step, but that's

96
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
that step for step for step, but that's
 

97
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,069
that step for step for step, but that's
the basic idea. Now, if I'm quicker than

98
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
the basic idea. Now, if I'm quicker than
 

99
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,670
the basic idea. Now, if I'm quicker than
him, I will disappear like a ghost,

100
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
him, I will disappear like a ghost,
 

101
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,270
him, I will disappear like a ghost,
right? As far as he's concerned, I will

102
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
right? As far as he's concerned, I will
 

103
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,710
right? As far as he's concerned, I will
just disappear and he will go like this

104
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:56,720
just disappear and he will go like this
 

105
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,789
just disappear and he will go like this
and stop and go. And I've seen it happen

106
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
and stop and go. And I've seen it happen
 

107
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,550
and stop and go. And I've seen it happen
in Geioaza before where someone made

108
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
in Geioaza before where someone made
 

109
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,910
in Geioaza before where someone made
perfect edi and the other person just

110
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
perfect edi and the other person just
 

111
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,749
perfect edi and the other person just
went, "Wait, where are they?" Because

112
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
went, "Wait, where are they?" Because
 

113
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,550
went, "Wait, where are they?" Because
it's really disorienting. So, I'm always

114
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
it's really disorienting. So, I'm always
 

115
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,790
it's really disorienting. So, I'm always
moving at an angle behind Josh and not

116
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
moving at an angle behind Josh and not
 

117
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,029
moving at an angle behind Josh and not
moving straight behind where I started

118
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
moving straight behind where I started
 

119
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,710
moving straight behind where I started
from Josh because behind Josh is always

120
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
from Josh because behind Josh is always
 

121
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,070
from Josh because behind Josh is always
changing. The edi point's always

122
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
changing. The edi point's always
 

123
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,589
changing. The edi point's always
changing, right? So, what I mean by that

124
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
changing, right? So, what I mean by that
 

125
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,350
changing, right? So, what I mean by that
is if we go step for step again and I go

126
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
is if we go step for step again and I go
 

127
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,869
is if we go step for step again and I go
this way, okay, and Josh's turn. Now

128
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
this way, okay, and Josh's turn. Now
 

129
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,710
this way, okay, and Josh's turn. Now
look, Josh's back is at an angle this

130
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
look, Josh's back is at an angle this
 

131
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,470
look, Josh's back is at an angle this
way. So this might still feel to me like

132
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
way. So this might still feel to me like
 

133
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,229
way. So this might still feel to me like
I continue on the path. I step, Josh

134
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
I continue on the path. I step, Josh
 

135
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,790
I continue on the path. I step, Josh
steps. Okay? Now I'm nowhere near Josh's

136
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
steps. Okay? Now I'm nowhere near Josh's
 

137
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,550
steps. Okay? Now I'm nowhere near Josh's
back, right? And if I step one more

138
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
back, right? And if I step one more
 

139
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,550
back, right? And if I step one more
time, Josh will actually have my back,

140
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
time, Josh will actually have my back,
 

141
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,229
time, Josh will actually have my back,
right? That's because I'm not changing

142
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
right? That's because I'm not changing
 

143
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,150
right? That's because I'm not changing
as he's changing. As Josh is changing, I

144
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
as he's changing. As Josh is changing, I
 

145
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,309
as he's changing. As Josh is changing, I
always need to change with him. Now the

146
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
always need to change with him. Now the
 

147
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,509
always need to change with him. Now the
essence that essence is what edidy meag

148
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
essence that essence is what edidy meag
 

149
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,309
essence that essence is what edidy meag
is, right? So the edi comes from that

150
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
is, right? So the edi comes from that
 

151
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,229
is, right? So the edi comes from that
happening. Now, another thing to import

152
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
happening. Now, another thing to import
 

153
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,990
happening. Now, another thing to import
important thing to understand is the

154
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
important thing to understand is the
 

155
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,270
important thing to understand is the
closer I stay to Josh during that exit

156
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
closer I stay to Josh during that exit
 

157
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,830
closer I stay to Josh during that exit
time, the more time I will buy myself

158
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
time, the more time I will buy myself
 

159
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,430
time, the more time I will buy myself
because it's further for him to turn.

160
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
because it's further for him to turn.
 

161
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,270
because it's further for him to turn.
And the further I get from him, the

162
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
And the further I get from him, the
 

163
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,550
And the further I get from him, the
easier it'll be for him to turn. Right?

164
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
easier it'll be for him to turn. Right?
 

165
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,910
easier it'll be for him to turn. Right?
So, what I mean by that is I'm going to

166
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
So, what I mean by that is I'm going to
 

167
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,350
So, what I mean by that is I'm going to
kind of shoot off at a little bit of an

168
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
kind of shoot off at a little bit of an
 

169
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,910
kind of shoot off at a little bit of an
angle. If I come behind Josh like this

170
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
angle. If I come behind Josh like this
 

171
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,750
angle. If I come behind Josh like this
and he takes a step, okay, and I take a

172
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
and he takes a step, okay, and I take a
 

173
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,670
and he takes a step, okay, and I take a
step and I'm going this way, he's going

174
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
step and I'm going this way, he's going
 

175
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,270
step and I'm going this way, he's going
to get behind me faster because I'm

176
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
to get behind me faster because I'm
 

177
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,270
to get behind me faster because I'm
giving him more room to work. Okay?

178
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
giving him more room to work. Okay?
 

179
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,830
giving him more room to work. Okay?
Instead though, if I go this way and I'm

180
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
Instead though, if I go this way and I'm
 

181
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,270
Instead though, if I go this way and I'm
getting closer to him, right? And see,

182
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
getting closer to him, right? And see,
 

183
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,910
getting closer to him, right? And see,
he steps and I step, I'm getting closer

184
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
he steps and I step, I'm getting closer
 

185
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,750
he steps and I step, I'm getting closer
to him. He steps and I step, I'm getting

186
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
to him. He steps and I step, I'm getting
 

187
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,270
to him. He steps and I step, I'm getting
closer to him. Right? Now, I'm not

188
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
closer to him. Right? Now, I'm not
 

189
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,630
closer to him. Right? Now, I'm not
saying that you want to stay close. But

190
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
saying that you want to stay close. But
 

191
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,790
saying that you want to stay close. But
in that brief moment that you're coming

192
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
in that brief moment that you're coming
 

193
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,309
in that brief moment that you're coming
behind him, that's what you're doing,

194
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
behind him, that's what you're doing,
 

195
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,309
behind him, that's what you're doing,
right? So, so we'll we'll go real time

196
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
right? So, so we'll we'll go real time
 

197
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,990
right? So, so we'll we'll go real time
here, right? So, let's say I'm here and

198
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
here, right? So, let's say I'm here and
 

199
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,030
here, right? So, let's say I'm here and
I'm just going to move quickly behind

200
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm just going to move quickly behind
 

201
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,070
I'm just going to move quickly behind
Josh and you're going to turn around to

202
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
Josh and you're going to turn around to
 

203
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,229
Josh and you're going to turn around to
catch me. Okay? That's what we're

204
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
catch me. Okay? That's what we're
 

205
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,910
catch me. Okay? That's what we're
looking for, right? Is I'm buying that

206
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
looking for, right? Is I'm buying that
 

207
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,990
looking for, right? Is I'm buying that
time out and I'm making him go on a

208
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
time out and I'm making him go on a
 

209
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
time out and I'm making him go on a
further loop to catch me. And then when

210
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
further loop to catch me. And then when
 

211
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,589
further loop to catch me. And then when
he does that, it's going to make us

212
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
he does that, it's going to make us
 

213
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,190
he does that, it's going to make us
further away when he finally does catch

214
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
further away when he finally does catch
 

215
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,030
further away when he finally does catch
me. Right? So by the time he caught me,

216
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
me. Right? So by the time he caught me,
 

217
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,710
me. Right? So by the time he caught me,
he was around there. We were already out

218
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
he was around there. We were already out
 

219
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,710
he was around there. We were already out
of my eye. Right? So you can see that

220
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
of my eye. Right? So you can see that
 

221
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,070
of my eye. Right? So you can see that
again like this. So we'll go and then

222
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
again like this. So we'll go and then
 

223
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,509
again like this. So we'll go and then
we'll we'll just stop. So stop when I

224
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
we'll we'll just stop. So stop when I
 

225
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,789
we'll we'll just stop. So stop when I
stop. So we go stop. Okay. We are

226
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
stop. So we go stop. Okay. We are
 

227
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,949
stop. So we go stop. Okay. We are
already now at MAI, right? So this

228
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
already now at MAI, right? So this
 

229
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,789
already now at MAI, right? So this
doesn't happen protracted. I showed it

230
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
doesn't happen protracted. I showed it
 

231
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,149
doesn't happen protracted. I showed it
that way just so you could see step for

232
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
that way just so you could see step for
 

233
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,070
that way just so you could see step for
step why it works that way. But within

234
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
step why it works that way. But within
 

235
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,149
step why it works that way. But within
one step, if I'm cutting tight behind

236
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
one step, if I'm cutting tight behind
 

237
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,030
one step, if I'm cutting tight behind
him, I will be at MAI or greater by the

238
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
him, I will be at MAI or greater by the
 

239
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,470
him, I will be at MAI or greater by the
time he gets around, which is all I

240
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
time he gets around, which is all I
 

241
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,750
time he gets around, which is all I
really want. on. I want to buy that ma

242
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
really want. on. I want to buy that ma
 

243
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,030
really want. on. I want to buy that ma
eye distance, right? So that's what I'm

244
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
eye distance, right? So that's what I'm
 

245
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,110
eye distance, right? So that's what I'm
always looking for. Okay. Now, the idimi

246
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
always looking for. Okay. Now, the idimi
 

247
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,429
always looking for. Okay. Now, the idimi
nag throw is when someone's turning

248
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
nag throw is when someone's turning
 

249
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,190
nag throw is when someone's turning
faster than you can get out of there,

250
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
faster than you can get out of there,
 

251
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,069
faster than you can get out of there,
right? So if he turns ultra ultra fast,

252
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
right? So if he turns ultra ultra fast,
 

253
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,430
right? So if he turns ultra ultra fast,
even with those tricks that I just

254
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
even with those tricks that I just
 

255
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,550
even with those tricks that I just
showed you, you can't get out of there.

256
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
showed you, you can't get out of there.
 

257
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,030
showed you, you can't get out of there.
So the edit nag helps us deal with that.

258
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
So the edit nag helps us deal with that.
 

259
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,469
So the edit nag helps us deal with that.
So as I'm passing this guy, let's go

260
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:25,479
So as I'm passing this guy, let's go
 

261
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,390
So as I'm passing this guy, let's go
like let's go like this. Okay. So as I'm

262
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
like let's go like this. Okay. So as I'm
 

263
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,830
like let's go like this. Okay. So as I'm
passing that guy, and I can tell he's

264
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
passing that guy, and I can tell he's
 

265
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,950
passing that guy, and I can tell he's
already turning. So I've taken like half

266
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
already turning. So I've taken like half
 

267
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,710
already turning. So I've taken like half
a step, and he's already here, right?

268
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
a step, and he's already here, right?
 

269
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,870
a step, and he's already here, right?
Okay. I know that this guy is going to

270
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
Okay. I know that this guy is going to
 

271
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,469
Okay. I know that this guy is going to
turn around faster than I can get out,

272
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
turn around faster than I can get out,
 

273
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,590
turn around faster than I can get out,
right? So, he's going to be around the

274
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
right? So, he's going to be around the
 

275
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,469
right? So, he's going to be around the
faster. So, all I do is step into him.

276
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
faster. So, all I do is step into him.
 

277
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,150
faster. So, all I do is step into him.
So, I step across him. Now, what this

278
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
So, I step across him. Now, what this
 

279
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,070
So, I step across him. Now, what this
will do when we're in time here, so uh

280
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
will do when we're in time here, so uh
 

281
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,909
will do when we're in time here, so uh
let's step step. Uh sorry, sorry. Yeah.

282
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
let's step step. Uh sorry, sorry. Yeah.
 

283
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,430
let's step step. Uh sorry, sorry. Yeah.
So, here we are. Okay. So, he's going to

284
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
So, here we are. Okay. So, he's going to
 

285
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,670
So, here we are. Okay. So, he's going to
go step and I step across him like this.

286
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
go step and I step across him like this.
 

287
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,510
go step and I step across him like this.
I'm hitting him at an angle where he's

288
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
I'm hitting him at an angle where he's
 

289
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,510
I'm hitting him at an angle where he's
not ready to brace yet. So, what's going

290
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
not ready to brace yet. So, what's going
 

291
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,909
not ready to brace yet. So, what's going
to happen is he gets twisted up. So, as

292
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
to happen is he gets twisted up. So, as
 

293
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,150
to happen is he gets twisted up. So, as
he comes in to get me on this, I am

294
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
he comes in to get me on this, I am
 

295
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,670
he comes in to get me on this, I am
walking more and more behind him and

296
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
walking more and more behind him and
 

297
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,189
walking more and more behind him and
twisting up more and more and more. Now,

298
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
twisting up more and more and more. Now,
 

299
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,110
twisting up more and more and more. Now,
the faster he tries to turn around to

300
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
the faster he tries to turn around to
 

301
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,110
the faster he tries to turn around to
get me, it will actually make the edim

302
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
get me, it will actually make the edim
 

303
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,990
get me, it will actually make the edim
nag worse on him because when that's

304
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
nag worse on him because when that's
 

305
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,029
nag worse on him because when that's
happening, he is uh twisting himself

306
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
happening, he is uh twisting himself
 

307
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,670
happening, he is uh twisting himself
more. It's like he will do less with his

308
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
more. It's like he will do less with his
 

309
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,430
more. It's like he will do less with his
feet than he does with his core. So, the

310
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
feet than he does with his core. So, the
 

311
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,790
feet than he does with his core. So, the
faster he tries to go, he's going to

312
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
faster he tries to go, he's going to
 

313
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,390
faster he tries to go, he's going to
turn his core more and more and more to

314
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
turn his core more and more and more to
 

315
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,590
turn his core more and more and more to
get me, and that's going to make him

316
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
get me, and that's going to make him
 

317
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,110
get me, and that's going to make him
more and more twisted up. So, the more I

318
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
more and more twisted up. So, the more I
 

319
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,430
more and more twisted up. So, the more I
step across him, then the the the harder

320
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
step across him, then the the the harder
 

321
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,790
step across him, then the the the harder
the throw is going to be for him, right?

322
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
the throw is going to be for him, right?
 

323
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,310
the throw is going to be for him, right?
Or the harder the just more complicated

324
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
Or the harder the just more complicated
 

325
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,710
Or the harder the just more complicated
it is for him to get me. Okay? Now, that

326
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
it is for him to get me. Okay? Now, that
 

327
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,390
it is for him to get me. Okay? Now, that
doesn't mean also that my ediaga is

328
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
doesn't mean also that my ediaga is
 

329
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,510
doesn't mean also that my ediaga is
always going to work because in order

330
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
always going to work because in order
 

331
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,110
always going to work because in order
for that to work, I need to keep him

332
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
for that to work, I need to keep him
 

333
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,390
for that to work, I need to keep him
tight up top here and I'm going to try

334
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
tight up top here and I'm going to try
 

335
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,150
tight up top here and I'm going to try
not to hit my microphone. But as he

336
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
not to hit my microphone. But as he
 

337
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,749
not to hit my microphone. But as he
starts to turn, I have to have this

338
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
starts to turn, I have to have this
 

339
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,950
starts to turn, I have to have this
happening right now. If he could just

340
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
happening right now. If he could just
 

341
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,310
happening right now. If he could just
pull his head out of there and turn,

342
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
pull his head out of there and turn,
 

343
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,749
pull his head out of there and turn,
that'll be no problem for him. Right?

344
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
that'll be no problem for him. Right?
 

345
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,909
that'll be no problem for him. Right?
So, so I will have backups. Triangle is

346
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
So, so I will have backups. Triangle is
 

347
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,029
So, so I will have backups. Triangle is
a backup for that. Right? So, let's say

348
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
a backup for that. Right? So, let's say
 

349
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,550
a backup for that. Right? So, let's say
he does come around, boom, I go triangle

350
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
he does come around, boom, I go triangle
 

351
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,830
he does come around, boom, I go triangle
and I can pop right out of there as

352
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
and I can pop right out of there as
 

353
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,510
and I can pop right out of there as
well. But, I need to keep this all

354
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
well. But, I need to keep this all
 

355
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,790
well. But, I need to keep this all
tight. And so, that's what you're seeing

356
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
tight. And so, that's what you're seeing
 

357
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,710
tight. And so, that's what you're seeing
in this pulling the collar in tight so

358
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
in this pulling the collar in tight so
 

359
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,150
in this pulling the collar in tight so
he can't get his head around. Now, if

360
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
he can't get his head around. Now, if
 

361
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,590
he can't get his head around. Now, if
we're here like this and I keep his chin

362
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
we're here like this and I keep his chin
 

363
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,430
we're here like this and I keep his chin
locked in place, turn to get me. See, if

364
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
locked in place, turn to get me. See, if
 

365
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,670
locked in place, turn to get me. See, if
his head can't turn, then he messes up

366
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
his head can't turn, then he messes up
 

367
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,950
his head can't turn, then he messes up
his body even more, right? So, he's more

368
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
his body even more, right? So, he's more
 

369
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,550
his body even more, right? So, he's more
and more and more out of balance. So,

370
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
and more and more out of balance. So,
 

371
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,230
and more and more out of balance. So,
that's the really simple idea of eating

372
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
that's the really simple idea of eating
 

373
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,550
that's the really simple idea of eating
meag is as I'm moving behind this guy,

374
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
meag is as I'm moving behind this guy,
 

375
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,070
meag is as I'm moving behind this guy,
and it is happening like a flash.

376
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
and it is happening like a flash.
 

377
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,029
and it is happening like a flash.
Although, you got to kind of break it

378
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
Although, you got to kind of break it
 

379
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,550
Although, you got to kind of break it
down like this to intellectually get it.

380
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
down like this to intellectually get it.
 

381
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,870
down like this to intellectually get it.
But as as you're going behind him,

382
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
But as as you're going behind him,
 

383
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,390
But as as you're going behind him,
you're always trying to keep your edi

384
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
you're always trying to keep your edi
 

385
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,150
you're always trying to keep your edi
position, which is across his back. Now,

386
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
position, which is across his back. Now,
 

387
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,990
position, which is across his back. Now,
if he is turning faster than you can

388
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
if he is turning faster than you can
 

389
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,390
if he is turning faster than you can
make your exit in that, all you do is

390
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
make your exit in that, all you do is
 

391
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,629
make your exit in that, all you do is
step across him while locking his head

392
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
step across him while locking his head
 

393
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,309
step across him while locking his head
in place. And if you do that, he will

394
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
in place. And if you do that, he will
 

395
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,150
in place. And if you do that, he will
throw himself. It's not a big close

396
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
throw himself. It's not a big close
 

397
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,990
throw himself. It's not a big close
line, right? So this classic really

398
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
line, right? So this classic really
 

399
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,309
line, right? So this classic really
pretty edit, it's not a clos line. It's

400
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
pretty edit, it's not a clos line. It's
 

401
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,070
pretty edit, it's not a clos line. It's
just keeping his head in place. So as he

402
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
just keeping his head in place. So as he
 

403
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,070
just keeping his head in place. So as he
turns, his head gets left behind and

404
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
turns, his head gets left behind and
 

405
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,590
turns, his head gets left behind and
that discombobulates his body and he

406
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
that discombobulates his body and he
 

407
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,870
that discombobulates his body and he
can't stay standing anymore and it will

408
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
can't stay standing anymore and it will
 

409
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,870
can't stay standing anymore and it will
take just about zero effort to step

410
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
take just about zero effort to step
 

411
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,990
take just about zero effort to step
through someone like that because their

412
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
through someone like that because their
 

413
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,430
through someone like that because their
feet are all twisted up at that point.

414
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
feet are all twisted up at that point.
 

415
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,909
feet are all twisted up at that point.
Right? So that's what Edy Minag is

416
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
Right? So that's what Edy Minag is
 

417
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,150
Right? So that's what Edy Minag is
genuinely doing. I believe um I've seen

418
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
genuinely doing. I believe um I've seen
 

419
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,390
genuinely doing. I believe um I've seen
it happen live. I've seen it happen in

420
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
it happen live. I've seen it happen in
 

421
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,870
it happen live. I've seen it happen in
crazy situations because you're just in

422
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
crazy situations because you're just in
 

423
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,309
crazy situations because you're just in
tight like that and it's too hard to

424
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
tight like that and it's too hard to
 

425
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,469
tight like that and it's too hard to
turn around. So that's what your edaga

426
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
turn around. So that's what your edaga
 

427
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,990
turn around. So that's what your edaga
should be in my opinion and it's not

428
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
should be in my opinion and it's not
 

429
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,909
should be in my opinion and it's not
some crazy clothesline or some magical

430
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
some crazy clothesline or some magical
 

431
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,589
some crazy clothesline or some magical
technique or something else. Really,

432
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
technique or something else. Really,
 

433
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,510
technique or something else. Really,
really simple. So I hope that helped.

434
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
really simple. So I hope that helped.
 

435
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,430
really simple. So I hope that helped.

salon McDaniel's behind that camera

438
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
salon McDaniel's behind that camera
 

439
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,230
salon McDaniel's behind that camera
right over there which we can't decide

440
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
right over there which we can't decide
 

441
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,830
right over there which we can't decide
if it's soft yet. We haven't figured it

442
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
if it's soft yet. We haven't figured it
 

443
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,110
if it's soft yet. We haven't figured it
maybe something wrong with that lens. We

444
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
maybe something wrong with that lens. We
 

445
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,390
maybe something wrong with that lens. We
don't know. Anyways, all right. We'll

446
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
don't know. Anyways, all right. We'll
 

447
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,599
don't know. Anyways, all right. We'll
see you in the near future.
