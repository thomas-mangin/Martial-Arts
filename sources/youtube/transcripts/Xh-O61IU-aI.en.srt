1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,830

uh if he if he has a push or you're

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
uh if he if he has a push or you're
 

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,430
uh if he if he has a push or you're
doing we're still working on

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
doing we're still working on
 

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,269
doing we're still working on
so when he has this push his push is

6
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
so when he has this push his push is
 

7
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,710
so when he has this push his push is
going that way

8
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
going that way
 

9
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,230
going that way
you see but through uh a particular

10
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
you see but through uh a particular
 

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,270
you see but through uh a particular
organization

12
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
organization
 

13
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,230
organization
he he can push and he's i'm aiming his

14
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
he he can push and he's i'm aiming his
 

15
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,349

push down on my
 

17
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,310
push down on my
on the ground you see so just to show

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
on the ground you see so just to show

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,550
on the ground you see so just to show
you

20
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
you
 

21
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,990
you
this will do from the grips okay so

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
this will do from the grips okay so
 

23
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,790
this will do from the grips okay so
if i am up here and he's going to push

uh that i can reorganize myself in such

32
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
uh that i can reorganize myself in such
 

33
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,150
uh that i can reorganize myself in such
a way

34
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
a way
 

35
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,869
a way
go ahead that his energy is just pushing

36
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
go ahead that his energy is just pushing
 

37
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,670
go ahead that his energy is just pushing
me down

38
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
me down
 

39
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,270
me down
on the ground and he can push really

40
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
on the ground and he can push really
 

41
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,950
on the ground and he can push really
hard and he's just

42
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
hard and he's just
 

43
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,510
hard and he's just
uh making my back foot go deeper and

44
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
uh making my back foot go deeper and
 

45
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,950
uh making my back foot go deeper and
deeper into the mat

46
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
deeper into the mat
 

47
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,350
deeper into the mat
not making it pull ball over my back

48
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
not making it pull ball over my back
 

49
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,110
not making it pull ball over my back
foot

50
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
foot
 

51
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,750
foot
so this is why he's pushing he's pushing

52
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
so this is why he's pushing he's pushing
 

53
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,270
so this is why he's pushing he's pushing
if he let's go really fast

54
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
if he let's go really fast
 

55
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,430
if he let's go really fast
this is why i don't go flying forward

56
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
this is why i don't go flying forward
 

57
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,510
this is why i don't go flying forward
because i'm not doing this where if he

58
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
because i'm not doing this where if he
 

59
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,470
because i'm not doing this where if he
lets go

60
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
lets go
 

61
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,789
lets go
then i'm going to fall forward fall

62
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
then i'm going to fall forward fall
 

63
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,910
then i'm going to fall forward fall
forward it's also why as he goes to push

64
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
forward it's also why as he goes to push
 

65
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,750
forward it's also why as he goes to push
and he's just pushing that one single

66
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
and he's just pushing that one single
 

67
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,590
and he's just pushing that one single
path that i don't i don't need my front

68
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
path that i don't i don't need my front
 

69
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,469
path that i don't i don't need my front
leg

70
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
leg
 

71
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,950
leg
he can't push that over because there's

72
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
he can't push that over because there's
 

73
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,030
he can't push that over because there's
no energy going over that way it's just

74
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
no energy going over that way it's just
 

75
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,310
no energy going over that way it's just
going down the ground he's pushing

76
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
going down the ground he's pushing
 

77
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,749
going down the ground he's pushing
really hard

78
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
really hard
 

79
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,789
really hard
it's the same thing okay and so

80
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
it's the same thing okay and so
 

81
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,030
it's the same thing okay and so
they say the same thing happens on this

82
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
they say the same thing happens on this
 

83
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,350
they say the same thing happens on this
crazy chair of ours

84
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
crazy chair of ours
 

85
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,630
crazy chair of ours
okay so as he goes as he goes to push

86
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
okay so as he goes as he goes to push
 

87
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,469

whoa okay i have to be able
 

89
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,710
whoa okay i have to be able
i feel that energy and i have to be able

90
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
i feel that energy and i have to be able
 

91
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,670
i feel that energy and i have to be able
to make it go

92
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
to make it go
 

93
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,749
to make it go
into into the ground i'm making it go

94
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
into into the ground i'm making it go
 

95
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,950
into into the ground i'm making it go
into the ground

96
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
into the ground
 

97
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,190
into the ground
same thing through the chair's legs and

98
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
same thing through the chair's legs and
 

99
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,270

so it's not that he's pushing i get out

170
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
so it's not that he's pushing i get out
 

171
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,589
so it's not that he's pushing i get out
of the way and i get this little one to

172
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
of the way and i get this little one to
 

173
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,229
of the way and i get this little one to
two inch

174
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
two inch
 

175
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,550
two inch
thick okay this adhesion

176
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
thick okay this adhesion
 

177
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,589
thick okay this adhesion
is what's making him go so

178
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
is what's making him go so
 

179
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,229
is what's making him go so
it always poke you is easier to get

180
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
it always poke you is easier to get
 

181
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,789
it always poke you is easier to get
first because it's more consistent with

182
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
first because it's more consistent with
 

183
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,990
first because it's more consistent with
our uh our fear of threat cycle

184
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
our uh our fear of threat cycle
 

185
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,350
our uh our fear of threat cycle
meaning because i can displace him

186
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
meaning because i can displace him
 

187
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,750
meaning because i can displace him
but your cue is going to be much more

188
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
but your cue is going to be much more
 

189
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,470
but your cue is going to be much more
viable if it's not slippery

190
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
viable if it's not slippery
 

191
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,030
viable if it's not slippery
so you see otherwise you have to find

192
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
so you see otherwise you have to find
 

193
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,949
so you see otherwise you have to find
the exact

194
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
the exact
 

195
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,390
the exact
right angle or some sort of uh 90 degree

196
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
right angle or some sort of uh 90 degree
 

197
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,350
right angle or some sort of uh 90 degree
45 degree angle or or you can push into

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
45 degree angle or or you can push into
 

199
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,990

it

200
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
it
 

201
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,070
it
but you don't you don't need that you

202
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
but you don't you don't need that you
 

203
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,910
but you don't you don't need that you
can you can have a focus

204
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
can you can have a focus
 

205
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,070
can you can have a focus
angle you can have one going sideways

206
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
angle you can have one going sideways
 

207
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,110

going this way

208
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
going this way
 

209
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,310
going this way
as long as you have the friction so

210
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
as long as you have the friction so
 

211
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,949
as long as you have the friction so
i do want this even how no matter how

212
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
i do want this even how no matter how
 

213
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,789
i do want this even how no matter how
great my pokey projections are

214
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
great my pokey projections are
 

215
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,550
great my pokey projections are
but for kazushi you definitely

216
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
but for kazushi you definitely
 

217
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,790
but for kazushi you definitely
want to keep this stuck

218
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
want to keep this stuck
 

219
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,909
want to keep this stuck
i don't want my kazushi to be

220
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
i don't want my kazushi to be
 

221
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,590
i don't want my kazushi to be
uh an external deviation

222
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
uh an external deviation
 

223
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,990
uh an external deviation
and that's hard to do because it it'll

224
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
and that's hard to do because it it'll
 

225
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,790
and that's hard to do because it it'll
sometimes

226
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
sometimes
 

227
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,749
sometimes
look like i don't need to have a stuck

228
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
look like i don't need to have a stuck
 

229
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,469
look like i don't need to have a stuck
hand

230
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
hand
 

231
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,629
hand
i could just tilt him with external

232
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
i could just tilt him with external
 

233
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,749
i could just tilt him with external
deviation

234
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
deviation
 

235
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,150
deviation
so the the the the apparent

236
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,160
so the the the the apparent
 

237
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,469
so the the the the apparent
substitution uh is what's

238
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
substitution uh is what's
 

239
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,230
substitution uh is what's
the problem okay it's hard to uh

240
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
the problem okay it's hard to uh
 

241
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,990
the problem okay it's hard to uh
to have uh a apparent substitution

242
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
to have uh a apparent substitution
 

243
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,990
to have uh a apparent substitution
for coke you like everyone should

244
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
for coke you like everyone should
 

245
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,270
for coke you like everyone should
recognize that's not

246
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
recognize that's not
 

247
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,790
recognize that's not
it but it's harder to go like well i did

248
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
it but it's harder to go like well i did
 

249
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,110
it but it's harder to go like well i did
have you don't you don't really have it

250
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
have you don't you don't really have it
 

251
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,430
have you don't you don't really have it
you're all slippery over here okay

252
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
you're all slippery over here okay
 

253
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,110
you're all slippery over here okay
so as as you're doing it it's two

254
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
so as as you're doing it it's two
 

255
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,230
so as as you're doing it it's two
um adhesions just one is to

256
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
um adhesions just one is to
 

257
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,670
um adhesions just one is to
separate us and one is to adhere us

258
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
separate us and one is to adhere us
 

259
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,990
separate us and one is to adhere us
okay so it's not this is not slippery

260
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
okay so it's not this is not slippery
 

261
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,070
okay so it's not this is not slippery
and this is not getting out of the way

262
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
and this is not getting out of the way
 

263
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,029
and this is not getting out of the way
they're both moving

264
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039

 

265
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:43,430

they're both adhering

266
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440

 

267
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,550

both in here and bowls in here

268
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
both in here and bowls in here
 

269
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,749
both in here and bowls in here
okay both in here so

270
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
okay both in here so
 

271
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,230
okay both in here so
it's easy to overshoot it you see but i

272
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
it's easy to overshoot it you see but i
 

273
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,150
it's easy to overshoot it you see but i
i have to find that relationship

274
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
i have to find that relationship
 

275
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,150
i have to find that relationship
you see and then it's easy to ignore

276
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
you see and then it's easy to ignore
 

277
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,830
you see and then it's easy to ignore
that one do you see that

278
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
that one do you see that
 

279
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,070
that one do you see that
but i don't ignore it so i use both to

280
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
but i don't ignore it so i use both to
 

281
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,390
but i don't ignore it so i use both to
do that

282
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400

 

283
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,749

you're going okay i'm gonna do that no

284
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
you're going okay i'm gonna do that no
 

285
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,870
you're going okay i'm gonna do that no
do this you see and then as you do

286
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
do this you see and then as you do
 

287
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,510
do this you see and then as you do
that as you're doing this hand uh using

288
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
that as you're doing this hand uh using
 

289
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,510
that as you're doing this hand uh using
this as an adhesion to pull

290
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
this as an adhesion to pull
 

291
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,350
this as an adhesion to pull
this is what we end up doing staples

292
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
this is what we end up doing staples
 

293
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,550
this is what we end up doing staples
dead but no

294
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
dead but no
 

295
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,510
dead but no
use the two hands to turn

296
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520

 

297
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,590

same thing it's easy to go i'm gonna

298
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
same thing it's easy to go i'm gonna
 

299
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,629
same thing it's easy to go i'm gonna
take this one

300
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
take this one
 

301
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,430
take this one
no just turn this

302
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440

 

303
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,670

okay so pay attention to what you're

304
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
okay so pay attention to what you're
 

305
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,710
okay so pay attention to what you're
doing

306
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
doing
 

307
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,950
doing
with the other hand once you think you

308
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
with the other hand once you think you
 

309
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,629
with the other hand once you think you
have his balance and you're going to

310
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
have his balance and you're going to
 

311
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,270
have his balance and you're going to
take it

312
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
take it
 

313
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,870
take it
pay attention to what you're doing with

314
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
pay attention to what you're doing with
 

315
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,469
pay attention to what you're doing with
this hand don't let it go

316
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
this hand don't let it go
 

317
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,749
this hand don't let it go
dead it is still pulling so

318
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
dead it is still pulling so
 

319
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,230
dead it is still pulling so
when i'm here like this yeah you see

320
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
when i'm here like this yeah you see
 

321
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,749
when i'm here like this yeah you see
okay there's my cool cue

322
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
okay there's my cool cue
 

323
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,110
okay there's my cool cue
but look you could have done it all on

324
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
but look you could have done it all on
 

325
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,790
but look you could have done it all on
that hand which means that hand could be

326
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
that hand which means that hand could be
 

327
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,390
that hand which means that hand could be
a redundant system

328
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
a redundant system
 

329
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,990
a redundant system
to to the kazushi

330
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
to to the kazushi
 

331
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:17,589
to to the kazushi
both hands have the same feeling

332
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
both hands have the same feeling
 

333
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,589
both hands have the same feeling
and then be cognizant that you're

334
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
