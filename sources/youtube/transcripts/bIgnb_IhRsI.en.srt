00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
so
 

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,230
so
you have to figure out

140
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
you have to figure out
 

141
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,189
you have to figure out
how to get that you see so if you if

142
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
how to get that you see so if you if
 

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,310
how to get that you see so if you if
you're doing a multi

144
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320

 

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,150

you're not going to do it like this

146
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160

 

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,710

so you have to turn him turn him there

148
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
so you have to turn him turn him there
 

149
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,230
so you have to turn him turn him there
it is

150
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240

 

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,870

same thing goes on 10 pod okay

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
same thing goes on 10 pod okay
 

153
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,550

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,110

so take card you have to be

156
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
so take card you have to be
 

157
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,870
so take card you have to be
way in the back

tencon we're going to uh
 

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,710
tencon we're going to uh
void okay and then we're going to be

192
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
void okay and then we're going to be
 

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:10,070
void okay and then we're going to be
able to enter

194
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080

 

195
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:23,270

197
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,029

what you're looking for is that you're

what you're looking for is that you're
 

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,230
what you're looking for is that you're
not pushing them away

201
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,550

since i'm not holding that integrity he

202
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
since i'm not holding that integrity he
 

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:45,670
since i'm not holding that integrity he
should keep coming in

204
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680

 

205
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,530

oh

217
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,070

let's go okay so you have to draw a

218
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
let's go okay so you have to draw a
 

219
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,070
let's go okay so you have to draw a
clear distinction between him hitting

220
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
clear distinction between him hitting
 

221
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,509
clear distinction between him hitting
that

222
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
that
 

223
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,710
that
and then you he hits it but you yield it

224
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
and then you he hits it but you yield it
 

225
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,790
and then you he hits it but you yield it
out of the way okay now when you're here

226
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
out of the way okay now when you're here
 

227
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,870
out of the way okay now when you're here
it's not back to him hitting that and

228
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
it's not back to him hitting that and
 

229
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,509
it's not back to him hitting that and
that's what knocks him down

230
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
that's what knocks him down
 

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,269
that's what knocks him down
he his energy

232
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
he his energy
 

233
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,070
he his energy
you have to spiral around so as he as he

234
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
you have to spiral around so as he as he
 

235
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,949
you have to spiral around so as he as he
hits it it has to come around

236
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
hits it it has to come around
 

237
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,870
hits it it has to come around
do you see

238
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
do you see
 

239
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,110
do you see
just like

240
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
just like
 

241
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,350
just like
so you can't enter if he's still going

242
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
so you can't enter if he's still going
 

243
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,910
so you can't enter if he's still going
that way that's just overpowering he's

244
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
that way that's just overpowering he's
 

245
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,350
that way that's just overpowering he's
falling already he's he's falling

246
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
falling already he's he's falling
 

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,829
falling already he's he's falling
well he's going to come in

248
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
well he's going to come in
 

249
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,829
well he's going to come in
and i'm going to do the circle on his

250
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
and i'm going to do the circle on his
 

251
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,750
and i'm going to do the circle on his
head he's already falling and i'm not

252
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
head he's already falling and i'm not
 

253
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,630
head he's already falling and i'm not
entering yet i enter with him to keep

254
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
entering yet i enter with him to keep
 

255
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,070
entering yet i enter with him to keep
contact with him and to attack his face

256
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
contact with him and to attack his face
 

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,310
contact with him and to attack his face
which is already compromised because his

258
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
which is already compromised because his
 

259
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,990
which is already compromised because his
upper body is following do you

260
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
upper body is following do you
 

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,350
upper body is following do you
understand

262
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
understand
 

263
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,590
understand
you're not here

264
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
you're not here
 

265
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,670
you're not here
and then

266
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
and then
 

267
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,829
and then
boom that's not it

268
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
boom that's not it
 

269
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,990
boom that's not it
it was already falling there's no energy

270
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
it was already falling there's no energy
 

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,630
it was already falling there's no energy
up here anymore okay what the arm is

272
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
up here anymore okay what the arm is
 

273
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,790
up here anymore okay what the arm is
doing at the top

274
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
doing at the top
 

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,069
doing at the top
is keeping the base attackable

276
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
is keeping the base attackable
 

277
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,550
is keeping the base attackable
okay so he's coming around

278
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
okay so he's coming around
 

279
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,190
okay so he's coming around
and imagine his energy's going that way

280
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
and imagine his energy's going that way
 

281
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,750
and imagine his energy's going that way
and it's keeping his base attackable

282
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760

 

283
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,470

so

284
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
so
 

285
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,150
so
if that's the case

286
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
if that's the case
 

287
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,910
if that's the case
then i can do this same technique

288
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
then i can do this same technique
 

289
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,910
then i can do this same technique
right there

290
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
right there
 

291
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,069
right there
i'm not on his head see i don't need the

292
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
i'm not on his head see i don't need the
 

293
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,790
i'm not on his head see i don't need the
distal end of the levers okay i'm not on

294
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
distal end of the levers okay i'm not on
 

295
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,630
distal end of the levers okay i'm not on
his head so

296
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
his head so
 

297
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,829
his head so
almost there and i yield that

298
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
almost there and i yield that
 

299
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,790
almost there and i yield that
here he comes around

300
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800

 

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,990

so i'm now

302
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
so i'm now
 

303
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,550
so i'm now
on his torso

304
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
on his torso
 

305
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,870
on his torso
now what notice hey

306
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
now what notice hey
 

307
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,949
now what notice hey
the torso

308
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
the torso
 

309
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,430
the torso
gives me the same triangle here's where

310
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
gives me the same triangle here's where
 

311
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,310
gives me the same triangle here's where
i do the reconciliation

312
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
i do the reconciliation
 

313
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,949
i do the reconciliation
locks the same body block and like lets

314
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
locks the same body block and like lets
 

315
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,030
locks the same body block and like lets
the stance be attackable

316
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
the stance be attackable
 

317
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:29,790
the stance be attackable
so you're doing the same technique

318
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:29,800

 

319
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,389
