pay attention to his hands after you get
 

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,069
pay attention to his hands after you get
to the elbow okay

20
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
to the elbow okay
 

21
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,870
to the elbow okay
so when i go over here

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
so when i go over here
 

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,270
so when i go over here
i am paying attention

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
i am paying attention
 

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,190
i am paying attention
to how that hand

26
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
to how that hand
 

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,990
to how that hand
goes into this lock here

28
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
goes into this lock here
 

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,710
goes into this lock here
this first lock here okay

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
this first lock here okay
 

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,350
this first lock here okay
so you you don't want to keep turning it

32
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
so you you don't want to keep turning it
 

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,910
so you you don't want to keep turning it
this is the emphasis on the elbow

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
this is the emphasis on the elbow
 

35
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,150
this is the emphasis on the elbow
go rewind the film

36
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
go rewind the film
 

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,390
go rewind the film
the elbow did his job

38
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
the elbow did his job
 

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,309
the elbow did his job
and i come off the elbow back into the

40
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
and i come off the elbow back into the
 

41
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,630
and i come off the elbow back into the
hand so yeah i have this one here

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
hand so yeah i have this one here
 

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,589
hand so yeah i have this one here
you see

44
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
you see
 

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,790
you see
so your grip can't keep turning

46
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
so your grip can't keep turning
 

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,550
so your grip can't keep turning
so we'll go back and i'll show you and

48
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
so we'll go back and i'll show you and
 

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,350
so we'll go back and i'll show you and
you can get smooth more smoothly

50
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
you can get smooth more smoothly
 

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,110
you can get smooth more smoothly
into

52
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
into
 

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,229
into
the pin

54
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
the pin
 

55
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,030
the pin
right away you see that

56
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040

 

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,670

let's do it again

58
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680

 

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,949

right in right into it immediately okay

60
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
right in right into it immediately okay
 

61
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,830
right in right into it immediately okay
whereas

62
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

 

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,589

you've been in la la land and you're

64
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
you've been in la la land and you're
 

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,229
you've been in la la land and you're
used to your

66
00:02:59,229 --> 00:02:59,239
used to your
 

67
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,750
used to your
choreography that falls

68
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
choreography that falls
 

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,070
choreography that falls
and you have this kind of stuff like

70
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
and you have this kind of stuff like
 

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,589
and you have this kind of stuff like
this you see

72
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
this you see
 

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,910
this you see
and this part from here

74
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
and this part from here
 

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,910
and this part from here
is a big assumption

76
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920

 

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,390

so if you now focus on where his wrist

78
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
so if you now focus on where his wrist
 

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,070
so if you now focus on where his wrist
was in space

80
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
was in space
 

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,670
was in space
after

82
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
after
 

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,509
after
the kazushi

84
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
the kazushi
 

85
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,110
the kazushi
it goes

86
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
it goes
 

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,710
it goes
right into the

88
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
right into the
 

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,630
right into the
technique you see

90
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
technique you see
 

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,430
technique you see
okay so we'll just smooth that part out

92
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440

 

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,750

you should be able to get it right away

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
you should be able to get it right away
 

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,949
you should be able to get it right away
okay

96
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
okay
 

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,149
okay
here we go

98
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
here we go
 

99
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,550
here we go
go again

100
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560

 

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,789

it says look how much that hand comes

102
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
it says look how much that hand comes
 

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,350
it says look how much that hand comes
over it comes way to the left of you

104
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
over it comes way to the left of you
 

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,309
over it comes way to the left of you
okay

106
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
okay
 

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:58,229
okay
okay let's go let's do it again

108
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239

 

109
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,990

oh let's go again

110
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000

 

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,470

okay same very similar thing all right

112
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
okay same very similar thing all right
 

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,509
okay same very similar thing all right
so this this is the uh the

114
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
so this this is the uh the
 

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,949
so this this is the uh the
aikido uh kind of stuff so you're not

116
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
aikido uh kind of stuff so you're not
 

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,789
aikido uh kind of stuff so you're not
you don't have a marshall application in

118
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
you don't have a marshall application in
 

119
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,909
you don't have a marshall application in
mind you see so you're like um

120
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
mind you see so you're like um
 

121
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,310
mind you see so you're like um
let me keep taking pressure off of this

122
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
let me keep taking pressure off of this
 

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,110
let me keep taking pressure off of this
you see so instead of the elbow control

124
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
you see so instead of the elbow control
 

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,430
you see so instead of the elbow control
we we pull on the hand

126
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
we we pull on the hand
 

127
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,870
we we pull on the hand
you see get it off

128
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880

 

129
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,550

you have to think a little differently

130
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
you have to think a little differently
 

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,430
you have to think a little differently
so

132
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
so
 

133
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,070
so
my elbow control

134
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
my elbow control
 

135
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,950
my elbow control
is

136
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
is
 

137
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,189
is
not

138
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
not
 

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,350
not
going to be about taking pressure off by

140
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
going to be about taking pressure off by
 

141
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,510
going to be about taking pressure off by
pulling this hand off okay so we're here

142
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
pulling this hand off okay so we're here
 

143
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,110
pulling this hand off okay so we're here
it's my body superior engine to him

144
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
it's my body superior engine to him
 

145
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,310
it's my body superior engine to him
you got it

146
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
you got it
 

147
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,670
you got it
my hand

148
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
my hand
 

149
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,230
my hand
is almost staying in place

150
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
is almost staying in place
 

151
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,110
is almost staying in place
and i'm going to take my

152
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
and i'm going to take my
 

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,070
and i'm going to take my
pelvis turn my pelvis unite my four

154
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
pelvis turn my pelvis unite my four
 

155
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,629
pelvis turn my pelvis unite my four
corners to it and that's what turns him

156
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
corners to it and that's what turns him
 

157
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,270
corners to it and that's what turns him
and you can see how the hand barely move

158
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
and you can see how the hand barely move
 

159
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,629
and you can see how the hand barely move
in space

160
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
in space
 

161
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,830
in space
and that's how i'm right

162
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
and that's how i'm right
 

163
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,830
and that's how i'm right
there right away

164
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
there right away
 

165
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,710
there right away
whereas

166
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720

 

167
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,189

i can't unite my four corners i can feel

168
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
i can't unite my four corners i can feel
 

169
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,950
i can't unite my four corners i can feel
that i'm getting

170
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
that i'm getting
 

171
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,469
that i'm getting
disconnected

172
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
disconnected
 

173
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,510
disconnected
and so what we do is we pull it off

174
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
and so what we do is we pull it off
 

175
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,390
and so what we do is we pull it off
you see

176
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
you see
 

177
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,510
you see
but now

178
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
but now
 

179
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,350
but now
yeah you're not going to get there again

180
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
yeah you're not going to get there again
 

181
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,110
yeah you're not going to get there again
okay

182
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
okay
 

183
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,110
okay
again in lava land you get there but

184
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
again in lava land you get there but
 

185
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,550
again in lava land you get there but
you're trying to arrest someone you're

186
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
you're trying to arrest someone you're
 

187
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,070
you're trying to arrest someone you're
not getting there they're out they're

188
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
not getting there they're out they're
 

189
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,670
not getting there they're out they're
gone okay

190
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
gone okay
 

191
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,189
gone okay
so hold pop you have to use the right

192
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
so hold pop you have to use the right
 

193
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,230
so hold pop you have to use the right
engine

194
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
engine
 

195
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,990
engine
here pay attention how much does the

196
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
here pay attention how much does the
 

197
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,230
here pay attention how much does the
hand actually travel in space that's

198
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
hand actually travel in space that's
 

199
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,590
hand actually travel in space that's
what we're looking at

200
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600

 

201
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,350

doesn't travel in space

202
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
doesn't travel in space
 

203
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,550
doesn't travel in space
okay

204
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
okay
 

205
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,909
okay
let's try it again

206
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919

 

207
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,909

okay the

208
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
okay the
 

209
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,790
okay the
the reference point of the second

210
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
the reference point of the second
 

211
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,189
the reference point of the second
law

212
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199

 

213
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,510

is that energy

214
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
is that energy
 

215
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,870
is that energy
is going to pass through

216
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
is going to pass through
 

217
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,270
is going to pass through
this way on his arm

218
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
this way on his arm
 

219
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,270
this way on his arm
okay

220
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
okay
 

221
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,510
okay
into the technique so

222
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
into the technique so
 

223
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,309
into the technique so
in

224
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
in
 

225
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,230
in
ikkyo i'm not

226
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
ikkyo i'm not
 

227
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,909
ikkyo i'm not
on this lever thing windmill

228
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
on this lever thing windmill
 

229
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,150
on this lever thing windmill
and i'm on the outside

230
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
and i'm on the outside
 

231
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,670
and i'm on the outside
okay

232
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
okay
 

233
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,070
okay
i'm going to come around from the inside

234
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
i'm going to come around from the inside
 

235
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,390
i'm going to come around from the inside
so when i got here

236
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
so when i got here
 

237
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,870
so when i got here
i should be in a position where i can

238
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
i should be in a position where i can
 

239
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,110
i should be in a position where i can
attack that elbow

240
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120

 

241
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,189

so i'm going to pass through

242
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199

 

243
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,590

in this energies this way

244
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
in this energies this way
 

245
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,870
in this energies this way
so the final pin position of ekyo you

246
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
so the final pin position of ekyo you
 

247
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,469
so the final pin position of ekyo you
already have it

248
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
already have it
 

249
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,350
already have it
you already have it where the two

250
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
you already have it where the two
 

251
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,270
you already have it where the two
uh the wrist and the elbow energies

252
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
uh the wrist and the elbow energies
 

253
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,830
uh the wrist and the elbow energies
making the triangle you you'll have it

254
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
making the triangle you you'll have it
 

255
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,510
making the triangle you you'll have it
through the technique

256
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
through the technique
 

257
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,350
through the technique
we'll have to let our partner out a

258
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
we'll have to let our partner out a
 

259
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,710
we'll have to let our partner out a
little

260
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
little
 

261
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,629
little
so we don't dislocate

262
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
so we don't dislocate
 

263
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,390
so we don't dislocate
go ahead and take your chemi you move

264
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
go ahead and take your chemi you move
 

265
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,510
go ahead and take your chemi you move
your body

266
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
your body
 

267
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,070
your body
okay but you can see

268
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
okay but you can see
 

269
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,270
okay but you can see
it's here

270
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
it's here
 

271
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,189
it's here
and it's not here it's going this way

272
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
and it's not here it's going this way
 

273
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,950
and it's not here it's going this way
this way

274
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
this way
 

275
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,790
this way
moving around this way

276
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
moving around this way
 

277
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,270
moving around this way
i'll let him out

278
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
i'll let him out
 

279
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,950
i'll let him out
you see

280
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
you see
 

281
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,710
you see
got it

282
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720

 

283
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,230

i'm doing the technique

284
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
i'm doing the technique
 

285
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,550
i'm doing the technique
i'm inside and i'll let it up

286
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560

 

287
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:44,070

where do i stand

288
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080

 

289
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,550

i'm gonna let him out

290
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
i'm gonna let him out
 

291
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,070
i'm gonna let him out
where do i step on the last step

292
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
where do i step on the last step
 

293
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,309
where do i step on the last step
this way

294
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
this way
 

295
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,390
this way
we're gonna make a turn we're not gonna

296
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
we're gonna make a turn we're not gonna
 

297
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,309
we're gonna make a turn we're not gonna
come back out this way

298
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
come back out this way
 

299
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,629
come back out this way
we're gonna make a turn

300
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
we're gonna make a turn
 

301
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,550
we're gonna make a turn
this way that's where i let him out of

302
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
this way that's where i let him out of
 

303
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
this way that's where i let him out of
the technique

304
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:01,530
the technique
 

305
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:10,070
the technique
[Music]

this way
 

309
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,830
this way
how how much that way so you could have

310
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
how how much that way so you could have
 

311
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,790
how how much that way so you could have
gone

312
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
gone
 

313
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,909
gone
over here

all here
on that step if i let go

326
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
on that step if i let go
 

327
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,790
on that step if i let go
that's the law i don't let go

328
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
that's the law i don't let go
 

329
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,029
that's the law i don't let go
but i'm already on the inside against

330
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
but i'm already on the inside against
 

331
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,310
but i'm already on the inside against
the elbow

and
 

339
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,990
and
this goes this way

340
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
this goes this way
 

341
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,389
this goes this way
that's what brings his hand

342
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
that's what brings his hand
 

343
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,550
that's what brings his hand
at his head level

344
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
at his head level
 

345
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,350
at his head level
and now i do

346
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
and now i do
 

347
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,590
and now i do
the quad mechanics for all those pins

348
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
the quad mechanics for all those pins
 

349
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,350
the quad mechanics for all those pins
okay

350
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
okay
 

351
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,350
okay
that means my

352
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
that means my
 

353
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,470
that means my
pelvis

354
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
pelvis
 

355
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,389
pelvis
and my energy

356
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
and my energy
 

357
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:21,110
and my energy
drops

358
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120

 

359
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,389

so early training

360
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
so early training
 

361
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,030
so early training
requires you to be able to

362
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
requires you to be able to
 

363
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,230
requires you to be able to
attach

364
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
attach
 

365
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,829
attach
for example

366
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
for example
 

367
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,829
for example
your wrist your elbows and your

368
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
your wrist your elbows and your
 

369
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,990
your wrist your elbows and your
shoulders to

370
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
shoulders to
 

371
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,190
shoulders to
your

372
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
your
 

373
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,870
your
pelvis

374
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
pelvis
 

375
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,790
pelvis
okay

376
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
okay
 

377
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,230
okay
and then

378
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
and then
 

379
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,430
and then
an overall architectural assumption

380
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
an overall architectural assumption
 

381
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,190
an overall architectural assumption
of

382
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
of
 

383
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,630
of
the art

384
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
the art
 

385
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,590
the art
the tactical architectures of the art

386
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
the tactical architectures of the art
 

387
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,230
the tactical architectures of the art
is there's a x value for the amount of

388
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
is there's a x value for the amount of
 

389
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,070
is there's a x value for the amount of
power you can generate

390
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
power you can generate
 

391
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,430
power you can generate
and then a y value for the amount of

392
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
and then a y value for the amount of
 

393
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,230
and then a y value for the amount of
power you can take away from that person

394
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
power you can take away from that person
 

395
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,310
power you can take away from that person
okay

396
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
okay
 

397
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,190
okay
but there is a value it's not any old

398
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
but there is a value it's not any old
 

399
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,389
but there is a value it's not any old
value okay it's not your value and your

400
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
value okay it's not your value and your
 

401
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,509
value okay it's not your value and your
value

402
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
value
 

403
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,790
value
okay so

404
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
okay so
 

405
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,069
okay so
to reach the x value of my power is very

406
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
to reach the x value of my power is very
 

407
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,670
to reach the x value of my power is very
related to

408
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
related to
 

409
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,910
related to
that pelvic utilization that's going to

410
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
that pelvic utilization that's going to
 

411
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,430
that pelvic utilization that's going to
make me reach my power potential

412
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
make me reach my power potential
 

413
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,470
make me reach my power potential
versus my arms shoulders elbows

414
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
versus my arms shoulders elbows
 

415
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,710
versus my arms shoulders elbows
wrists are operating independently

416
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
wrists are operating independently
 

417
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,910
wrists are operating independently
you're going to be way you're going to

418
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
you're going to be way you're going to
 

419
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,110
you're going to be way you're going to
be sub x okay

420
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
be sub x okay
 

421
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,110
be sub x okay
so when i go here i'm not going like

422
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
so when i go here i'm not going like
 

423
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,310
so when i go here i'm not going like
this

424
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
this
 

425
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,389
this
you see that you see how my elbow came

426
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
you see that you see how my elbow came
 

427
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,470
you see that you see how my elbow came
out

428
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
out
 

429
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,069
out
this hand is locked in the relationship

430
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
this hand is locked in the relationship
 

431
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,910
this hand is locked in the relationship
with my pelvis

432
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
with my pelvis
 

433
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,069
with my pelvis
the only way he's going to make this

434
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
the only way he's going to make this
 

435
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,150
the only way he's going to make this
hand go here

436
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
hand go here
 

437
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,949
hand go here
right is the pelvis has to fail

438
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959

 

439
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,949

then a y value

440
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
then a y value
 

441
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,269
then a y value
he's pushing he's pushing he

442
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
he's pushing he's pushing he
 

443
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,509
he's pushing he's pushing he
he's not going to he will not be strong

444
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
he's not going to he will not be strong
 

445
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,430
he's not going to he will not be strong
although he's way stronger than me he

446
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
although he's way stronger than me he
 

447
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,670
although he's way stronger than me he
will not be strong enough against that

448
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
will not be strong enough against that
 

449
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,190
will not be strong enough against that
pelvis

450
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
pelvis
 

451
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,829
pelvis
but i can do a y value too i could take

452
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
but i can do a y value too i could take
 

453
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,230
but i can do a y value too i could take
pressure off of him

454
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240

 

455
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,829

but you don't want to just go by value

456
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
but you don't want to just go by value
 

457
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,870
but you don't want to just go by value
so

458
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
so
 

459
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,269
so
he's here boom pelvis is in a

460
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
he's here boom pelvis is in a
 

461
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,110
he's here boom pelvis is in a
relationship with my elbow wrist and

462
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
relationship with my elbow wrist and
 

463
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,069
relationship with my elbow wrist and
shoulder

464
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
shoulder
 

465
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,430
shoulder
and i'm going to take some of his

466
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
and i'm going to take some of his
 

467
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,230
and i'm going to take some of his
pressure off with the y value so that i

468
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
pressure off with the y value so that i
 

469
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,470
pressure off with the y value so that i
can go back into my x value

470
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
can go back into my x value
 

471
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,910
can go back into my x value
you see

472
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920

 

473
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,150

not going

474
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160

 

475
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,350

keep trying for y

476
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360

 

477
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,509

sum

478
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519

 

479
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,110

so here

480
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
so here
 

481
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,389
so here
you can go

482
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
you can go
 

483
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,310
you can go
y value

484
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
y value
 

485
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,550
y value
y value but you're going to give up too

486
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
y value but you're going to give up too
 

487
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,990
y value but you're going to give up too
much why that

488
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
much why that
 

489
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,990
much why that
instead

490
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
instead
 

491
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,069
instead
use your pelvis

492
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
use your pelvis
 

493
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,790
use your pelvis
you want that hand over here

494
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
you want that hand over here
 

495
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,389
you want that hand over here
turn your pelvis

496
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399

 

497
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,990

do you see

498
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
do you see
 

499
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,430
do you see
then you want this hand over there

500
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
then you want this hand over there
 

501
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,069
then you want this hand over there
move your pelvis

502
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
move your pelvis
 

503
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,590
move your pelvis
move it

504
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
move it
 

505
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,509
move it
you want this these fingers to go

506
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
you want this these fingers to go
 

507
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,949
you want this these fingers to go
towards his head

508
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
towards his head
 

509
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,670
towards his head
drop your pelvis

510
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
drop your pelvis
 

511
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,910
drop your pelvis
you want to break his arm drop your

512
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
you want to break his arm drop your
 

513
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,110
you want to break his arm drop your
pelvis

514
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120

 

515
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,829

so when you come around to the technique

516
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
so when you come around to the technique
 

517
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,150
so when you come around to the technique
and you do the last part

518
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
and you do the last part
 

519
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,829
and you do the last part
my pelvis is moving

520
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839

 

521
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,509

not my hands

522
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
not my hands
 

523
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,350
not my hands
i come down

524
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360

 

525
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,509

this last part

526
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
this last part
 

527
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,350
this last part
drop it just like you did in all the

528
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
drop it just like you did in all the
 

529
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,550
drop it just like you did in all the
other pins

530
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
other pins
 

531
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,629
other pins
i'm not going like this

532
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
i'm not going like this
 

533
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,310
i'm not going like this
i'm not going like this i'm not doing

534
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
i'm not going like this i'm not doing
 

535
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,990
i'm not going like this i'm not doing
