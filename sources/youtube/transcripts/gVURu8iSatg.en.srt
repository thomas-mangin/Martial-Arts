going to talk about the way I pin and
 

5
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,829
going to talk about the way I pin and
one of the horrible horrible things I

6
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
one of the horrible horrible things I
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,390
one of the horrible horrible things I
think that happens in pinning all of the

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
think that happens in pinning all of the
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,430
think that happens in pinning all of the
time that we actually generally don't

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
time that we actually generally don't
 

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,430
time that we actually generally don't
even think about in iido and I think we

12
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
even think about in iido and I think we
 

13
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,430
even think about in iido and I think we
really should think about it because

14
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
really should think about it because
 

15
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,349
really should think about it because
it's a really important thing um and I

16
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
it's a really important thing um and I
 

17
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,310
it's a really important thing um and I
think it's a mistake that everyone makes

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
think it's a mistake that everyone makes
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,590
think it's a mistake that everyone makes
all the time I made it for years until

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:22,600
all the time I made it for years until
 

21
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,230
all the time I made it for years until
for myself I really started breaking

22
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
for myself I really started breaking
 

23
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,630
for myself I really started breaking
down how pins work in iido and what the

24
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
down how pins work in iido and what the
 

25
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
down how pins work in iido and what the
goals are in the pins and how to most

26
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
goals are in the pins and how to most
 

27
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,269
goals are in the pins and how to most
efficiently apply the pin so I'm GNA

28
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
efficiently apply the pin so I'm GNA
 

29
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,190
efficiently apply the pin so I'm GNA

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
mistake I see consistantly in the
 

47
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,910
mistake I see consistantly in the
sitting pins um and I'm only going to

48
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,920
sitting pins um and I'm only going to
 

49
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,430
sitting pins um and I'm only going to
cover sitting pins right now so there

50
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,440
cover sitting pins right now so there
 

51
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,270
cover sitting pins right now so there
are a myriad of standup pins maybe we

52
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,280
are a myriad of standup pins maybe we
 

53
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,029
are a myriad of standup pins maybe we
put that in another video but uh I want

54
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039
put that in another video but uh I want
 

55
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,790
put that in another video but uh I want
to talk about just a tiny bit about the

56
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:03,800
to talk about just a tiny bit about the
 

57
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,310
to talk about just a tiny bit about the
taked down and then about the pen so in

58
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
taked down and then about the pen so in
 

59
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,270
taked down and then about the pen so in
iido generally we're going to be taking

60
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,280
iido generally we're going to be taking
 

61
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,469
iido generally we're going to be taking
down from the arm whether that's an EO

62
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:11,479
down from the arm whether that's an EO
 

63
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,070
down from the arm whether that's an EO
or a Niko or a Yono or a goo um or roio

64
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,080
or a Niko or a Yono or a goo um or roio
 

65
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,870
or a Niko or a Yono or a goo um or roio
we're probably going to be using this if

66
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
we're probably going to be using this if
 

67
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,109
we're probably going to be using this if
we get him backwards like this we're

68
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
we get him backwards like this we're
 

69
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,109
we get him backwards like this we're
probably this is probably a Sano pin

70
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
probably this is probably a Sano pin
 

71
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,990
probably this is probably a Sano pin
right so it could be either and this is

72
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,000
right so it could be either and this is
 

73
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,270
right so it could be either and this is
called UD which just means arm pin Tak

74
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,280
called UD which just means arm pin Tak
 

75
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,510
called UD which just means arm pin Tak
down um and this is a yaku and this is

76
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
down um and this is a yaku and this is
 

77
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,310
down um and this is a yaku and this is
regular UD O say right so I'm on this

78
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:33,320
regular UD O say right so I'm on this
 

79
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,789
regular UD O say right so I'm on this
side okay now either way I'm going to

80
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:35,799
side okay now either way I'm going to
 

81
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,190
side okay now either way I'm going to
always drop my inside knee first and my

82
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,200
always drop my inside knee first and my
 

83
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,789
always drop my inside knee first and my
inside knee is going to be behind Josh

84
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
inside knee is going to be behind Josh
 

85
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,469
inside knee is going to be behind Josh
right so let's say I'm doing a standard

86
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
right so let's say I'm doing a standard
 

87
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,270
right so let's say I'm doing a standard
old EO pin here right okay I'm going to

88
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280
old EO pin here right okay I'm going to
 

89
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,190
old EO pin here right okay I'm going to
take Josh down my inside leg is going to

90
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
take Josh down my inside leg is going to
 

91
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,990
take Josh down my inside leg is going to
drive Josh down and Josh needs to be

92
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
drive Josh down and Josh needs to be
 

93
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,990
drive Josh down and Josh needs to be
ahead of me so meaning Josh is down now

94
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,000
ahead of me so meaning Josh is down now
 

95
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,950
ahead of me so meaning Josh is down now
and my knee's down right after that

96
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
and my knee's down right after that
 

97
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,310
and my knee's down right after that
right so I drive Josh down and then my

98
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,320
right so I drive Josh down and then my
 

99
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,630
right so I drive Josh down and then my
knee goes down if I do this the opposite

100
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
knee goes down if I do this the opposite
 

101
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,670
knee goes down if I do this the opposite
I have no power right so if Josh is up

102
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:02,680
I have no power right so if Josh is up
 

103
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,109
I have no power right so if Josh is up
and I'm down my weight is already all on

104
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
and I'm down my weight is already all on
 

105
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,950
and I'm down my weight is already all on
the ground right so whatever weight I

106
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
the ground right so whatever weight I
 

107
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,430
the ground right so whatever weight I
have you know if I weighed 110 lb then

108
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
have you know if I weighed 110 lb then
 

109
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,510
have you know if I weighed 110 lb then
that would be I'd be lacking 110 PB if I

110
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
that would be I'd be lacking 110 PB if I
 

111
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,070
that would be I'd be lacking 110 PB if I
weigh 200 lb I'm lacking 200 lb right so

112
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
weigh 200 lb I'm lacking 200 lb right so
 

113
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,309
weigh 200 lb I'm lacking 200 lb right so
my my pen would be significantly less

114
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
my my pen would be significantly less
 

115
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,710
my my pen would be significantly less
powerful if I put my knee down before I

116
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
powerful if I put my knee down before I
 

117
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,430
powerful if I put my knee down before I
drive him down so as you're bring him

118
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:20,440
drive him down so as you're bring him
 

119
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,830
drive him down so as you're bring him
down always drive him down ahead of your

120
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
down always drive him down ahead of your
 

121
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,990
down always drive him down ahead of your
knee so Josh's shoulder locks down

122
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
knee so Josh's shoulder locks down
 

123
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,990
knee so Josh's shoulder locks down
before my knee locks down okay now when

124
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,000
before my knee locks down okay now when
 

125
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,670
before my knee locks down okay now when
I'm here I want to make sure his

126

I'm here I want to make sure his
 

127
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,309
I'm here I want to make sure his
shoulder is secured 100% to the mat

128
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:33,319

129
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,589
shoulder is secured 100% to the mat
right so I am in this upright position

130
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
right so I am in this upright position
 

131
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,509
right so I am in this upright position
driving his shoulder down as much as I

132
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519

position right now okay now depending on

138
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:43,319
position right now okay now depending on
 

139
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,149
position right now okay now depending on
what take down will depend on the set of

140
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:45,159
what take down will depend on the set of
 

141
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,350
what take down will depend on the set of
holds I go into but the next thing is to

142
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
holds I go into but the next thing is to
 

143
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,390

149
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,670
way and that's where we're going to
start to get our pin now um try not to

150
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:56,680
start to get our pin now um try not to
 

151

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:03,640
you're in this position bring your foot
 

159
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,229
you're in this position bring your foot
over and that'll give you a lot more

160
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:05,239
over and that'll give you a lot more
 

161
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,270
over and that'll give you a lot more
power to drive his um arm over okay so

162
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,280
power to drive his um arm over okay so
 

163
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,229
power to drive his um arm over okay so
what I'm trying to do is I've got his

164
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,239
what I'm trying to do is I've got his
 

165
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,670
what I'm trying to do is I've got his
shoulder locked down and I'm Levering

166
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:10,680
shoulder locked down and I'm Levering
 

167
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,070
shoulder locked down and I'm Levering
his arm this way to get him to go okay

168
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
his arm this way to get him to go okay
 

169
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,509
his arm this way to get him to go okay
now we're going to start to talk about

170
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:14,519
now we're going to start to talk about
 

171
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,390
now we're going to start to talk about
that horrible thing I was talking about

172
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
that horrible thing I was talking about
 

173
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,430
that horrible thing I was talking about
now Josh right now like most of us at a

174
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
now Josh right now like most of us at a
 

175
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,789
now Josh right now like most of us at a
certain point in time you start to lack

176
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
certain point in time you start to lack
 

177
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,869
certain point in time you start to lack
a little bit of flexibility with your

178
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
a little bit of flexibility with your
 

179
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,910
a little bit of flexibility with your
arms behind you right so you won't see

180
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
arms behind you right so you won't see
 

181
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,229
arms behind you right so you won't see
this in children or real flexible people

182
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
this in children or real flexible people
 

183
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,750
this in children or real flexible people
but right about here is where Josh is

184
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:30,760
but right about here is where Josh is
 

185
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,309
but right about here is where Josh is
tapping now he's tapping because his

186
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:33,319
tapping now he's tapping because his
 

187
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,869
tapping now he's tapping because his
shoulder is totally tight right now so

188
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:35,879
shoulder is totally tight right now so
 

189
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,149
shoulder is totally tight right now so
if I were to try to go into the full

190
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
if I were to try to go into the full
 

191
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,350
if I were to try to go into the full
variation of this pin with Josh right

192
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:40,360
variation of this pin with Josh right
 

193
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,630
variation of this pin with Josh right
now and I and I did it all the way

194
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
now and I and I did it all the way
 

195
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,509
now and I and I did it all the way
either his shoulder would go out of

196
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
either his shoulder would go out of
 

197
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,390
either his shoulder would go out of
socket or I have to go into a stupid

198
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
socket or I have to go into a stupid
 

199
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,990
socket or I have to go into a stupid
position which means I go like this or

200
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,000
position which means I go like this or
 

201
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,110
position which means I go like this or
something right and I try to pin now I

202
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
something right and I try to pin now I
 

203
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,030
something right and I try to pin now I
see Iko people pinning like this a lot

204
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
see Iko people pinning like this a lot
 

205
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,429
see Iko people pinning like this a lot
with people with tight shoulders and

206
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:54,439
with people with tight shoulders and
 

207
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,110
with people with tight shoulders and
this is a horrible idea I just put

208
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,120
this is a horrible idea I just put
 

209
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,630
this is a horrible idea I just put
myself into a weaker position just

210
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
myself into a weaker position just
 

211
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,910
myself into a weaker position just
because I need to accommodate the

212
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
because I need to accommodate the
 

213
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,789
because I need to accommodate the
shoulder so the form of this pin is

214
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
shoulder so the form of this pin is
 

215
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,910
shoulder so the form of this pin is
being executed but actually the reason

216
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
being executed but actually the reason
 

217
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,670
being executed but actually the reason
for the form is not being executed so

218
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
for the form is not being executed so
 

219
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,550
for the form is not being executed so
right now I'm weak I've got really no

220
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,560
right now I'm weak I've got really no
 

221
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,670
right now I'm weak I've got really no
ability to hold Josh down Josh I took a

222
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
ability to hold Josh down Josh I took a
 

223
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,509
ability to hold Josh down Josh I took a
lot of pressure out of Josh's shoulders

224
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
lot of pressure out of Josh's shoulders
 

225
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,350
lot of pressure out of Josh's shoulders
so I could come this way right so if I

226
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
so I could come this way right so if I
 

227
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,789
so I could come this way right so if I
didn't do this his shoulder would have

228
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
didn't do this his shoulder would have
 

229
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,789
didn't do this his shoulder would have
popped when I did this right so it'd

230
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
popped when I did this right so it'd
 

231
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,670
popped when I did this right so it'd
probably dislocate if I kept driving his

232
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:20,680
probably dislocate if I kept driving his
 

233
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,110
probably dislocate if I kept driving his
hand come up quick if I just keep

234
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,120
hand come up quick if I just keep
 

235
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,150
hand come up quick if I just keep
driving my pressure down right so let's

236
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
driving my pressure down right so let's
 

237
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,710
driving my pressure down right so let's
look at Maya movie Magic so this is Maya

238
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
look at Maya movie Magic so this is Maya
 

239
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,790
look at Maya movie Magic so this is Maya
now so if we use Maya Maya's got a lot

240
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
now so if we use Maya Maya's got a lot
 

241
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,510
now so if we use Maya Maya's got a lot
more flexibility with her arms behind

242
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
more flexibility with her arms behind
 

243
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,390
more flexibility with her arms behind
her now in order to pin I can pin

244
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
her now in order to pin I can pin
 

245
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,029
her now in order to pin I can pin
perfectly straight so see how my spine's

246
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:36,039
perfectly straight so see how my spine's
 

247
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,790
perfectly straight so see how my spine's
way straight my shoulders still locked

248
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,800
way straight my shoulders still locked
 

249
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,430
way straight my shoulders still locked
down she's got all this flexibility and

250
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
down she's got all this flexibility and
 

251
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,189
down she's got all this flexibility and
then I drop down here I secure her hand

252
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,199
then I drop down here I secure her hand
 

253
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,990
then I drop down here I secure her hand
however it is I'm going to secure

254
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,000
however it is I'm going to secure
 

255
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,710
however it is I'm going to secure
depending on the pin I'm doing I drop to

256
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
depending on the pin I'm doing I drop to
 

257
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,189
depending on the pin I'm doing I drop to
her elbow depending again on the pin I'm

258
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:46,199
her elbow depending again on the pin I'm
 

259
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,110
her elbow depending again on the pin I'm
doing and I lock her all the way down

260
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,120
doing and I lock her all the way down
 

261
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,990
doing and I lock her all the way down
then the arm goes up I remove the rest

262
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
then the arm goes up I remove the rest
 

263
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,150
then the arm goes up I remove the rest
of the slack now you see her foot just

264
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,160
of the slack now you see her foot just
 

265
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,029
of the slack now you see her foot just
come up her foot came up because this

266
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,039
come up her foot came up because this
 

267
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,230
come up her foot came up because this
got tight right now and then I lean

268
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
got tight right now and then I lean
 

269
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,110
got tight right now and then I lean
forward a little bit now here's another

270
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,120
forward a little bit now here's another
 

271
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,189
forward a little bit now here's another
pin problem you see the opposite of this

272
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:00,199
pin problem you see the opposite of this
 

273
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,590
pin problem you see the opposite of this
one which is really a horrible way to

274
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
one which is really a horrible way to
 

275
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,909
one which is really a horrible way to
pin is if they're flexible like Maya is

276
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:04,919
pin is if they're flexible like Maya is
 

277
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,390
pin is if they're flexible like Maya is
and they just from right here start to

278
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
and they just from right here start to
 

279
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,070
and they just from right here start to
lean forward look how far over I can go

280
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,080
lean forward look how far over I can go
 

281
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,469
lean forward look how far over I can go
before Maya's really starting to feel

282
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
before Maya's really starting to feel
 

283
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,310
before Maya's really starting to feel
the pin right I'm really leaned over too

284
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
the pin right I'm really leaned over too
 

285
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,110
the pin right I'm really leaned over too
far but if I take her arm up towards her

286
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
far but if I take her arm up towards her
 

287
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,110
far but if I take her arm up towards her
head so I'm going this direction towards

288
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
head so I'm going this direction towards
 

289
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,950
head so I'm going this direction towards
her head I tighten that up now you see

290
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
her head I tighten that up now you see
 

291
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,790
her head I tighten that up now you see
as she moved her foot if I kept going

292
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
as she moved her foot if I kept going
 

293
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,390
as she moved her foot if I kept going
this way that would probably tap her

294
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
this way that would probably tap her
 

295
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,510
this way that would probably tap her
right now but I can get even more by

296
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:24,520
right now but I can get even more by
 

297
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,670
right now but I can get even more by
leaning into her just a little bit right

298
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:26,680
leaning into her just a little bit right
 

299
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,189
leaning into her just a little bit right
so when you have someone who's really

300
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:28,199
so when you have someone who's really
 

301
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,629
so when you have someone who's really
really flexible there arm can go pretty

302
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
really flexible there arm can go pretty
 

303
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,590
really flexible there arm can go pretty
far this way as long as it's in a down

304
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
far this way as long as it's in a down
 

305
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,270
far this way as long as it's in a down
position now the further down I bring

306
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,280
position now the further down I bring
 

307
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,309
position now the further down I bring
her arm her hand like towards her legs

308
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:37,319
her arm her hand like towards her legs
 

309
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,950
her arm her hand like towards her legs
then she her arm can go even further

310
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
then she her arm can go even further
 

311
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,070
then she her arm can go even further
over but the further I take her arm up

312
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,080
over but the further I take her arm up
 

313
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,350
over but the further I take her arm up
over her head you see how her hand just

314
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,360
over her head you see how her hand just
 

315
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,670
over her head you see how her hand just
came up it's CU it's getting tight right

316
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
came up it's CU it's getting tight right
 

317
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,710
came up it's CU it's getting tight right
now and I start to take it over now it's

318
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:45,720
now and I start to take it over now it's
 

319
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,790
now and I start to take it over now it's
much much tighter now if you have

320
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:47,800
much much tighter now if you have
 

321
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,790
much much tighter now if you have
someone like Gumby right and this was

322
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:49,800
someone like Gumby right and this was
 

323
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,150
someone like Gumby right and this was
Maya probably about five years ago right

324
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
Maya probably about five years ago right
 

325
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,710
Maya probably about five years ago right
so uh as we age all of us and it happens

326
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:55,720
so uh as we age all of us and it happens
 

327
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,309
so uh as we age all of us and it happens
relatively quickly start losing

328
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:57,319
relatively quickly start losing
 

329
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,830
relatively quickly start losing
flexibility behind us and it's because

330
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:58,840
flexibility behind us and it's because
 

331
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,990
flexibility behind us and it's because
we build bigger muscles in front of us

332
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,000
we build bigger muscles in front of us
 

333
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,230
we build bigger muscles in front of us
so we lose that flexibility behind us so

334
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
so we lose that flexibility behind us so
 

335
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,309
so we lose that flexibility behind us so
if you have someone who's really like

336
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
if you have someone who's really like
 

337
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,510
if you have someone who's really like
Gumby they might still be even with the

338
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
Gumby they might still be even with the
 

339
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,189
Gumby they might still be even with the
arm really far up they might be able to

340
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:08,199
arm really far up they might be able to
 

341
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,110
arm really far up they might be able to
to not tap so in that case what we do is

342
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,120
to not tap so in that case what we do is
 

343
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,189
to not tap so in that case what we do is
we bend the elbow here and we crank the

344
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:12,199
we bend the elbow here and we crank the
 

345
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,990
we bend the elbow here and we crank the
hand towards the head right so what that

346
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
hand towards the head right so what that
 

347
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,390
hand towards the head right so what that
looks like let me have you turn this way

348
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:15,400
looks like let me have you turn this way
 

349
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,629
looks like let me have you turn this way
just a little bit okay so what that

350
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:17,639
just a little bit okay so what that
 

351
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,230
just a little bit okay so what that
looks like is as I'm here I pull that

352
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
looks like is as I'm here I pull that
 

353
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,870
looks like is as I'm here I pull that
elbow in tight to me like this and I

354
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:21,880
elbow in tight to me like this and I
 

355
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,110
elbow in tight to me like this and I
continue the hand up now you see how

356
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
continue the hand up now you see how
 

357
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,510
continue the hand up now you see how
quick she moved it's cuz it's got really

358
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:24,520
quick she moved it's cuz it's got really
 

359
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,350
quick she moved it's cuz it's got really
tight really really fast I can continue

360
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,360
tight really really fast I can continue
 

361
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,110
tight really really fast I can continue
that hand up here and it would be just

362
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,120
that hand up here and it would be just
 

363
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,430
that hand up here and it would be just
like you would see a cur or a hammer

364
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:30,440
like you would see a cur or a hammer
 

365
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,710
like you would see a cur or a hammer
lock something like that from a

366
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:31,720
lock something like that from a
 

367
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,350
lock something like that from a
grappling style where I'm moving the

368
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
grappling style where I'm moving the
 

369
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,230
grappling style where I'm moving the
hand up and that really really cranks

370
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,240
hand up and that really really cranks
 

371
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,629
hand up and that really really cranks
into the shoulder really really tight so

372
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
into the shoulder really really tight so
 

373
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,150
into the shoulder really really tight so
I've removed a lot more slack by bending

374
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
I've removed a lot more slack by bending
 

375
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,469
I've removed a lot more slack by bending
this arm like that so again the process

376
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
this arm like that so again the process
 

377
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,950
this arm like that so again the process
is always drop the inside knee make sure

378
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
is always drop the inside knee make sure
 

379
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,189
is always drop the inside knee make sure
the shoulders locked down then drop this

380
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,199
the shoulders locked down then drop this
 

381
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,830
the shoulders locked down then drop this
leg and put the the arm along your body

382
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:48,840
leg and put the the arm along your body
 

383
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,350
leg and put the the arm along your body
now as you do that this is all

384
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:50,360
now as you do that this is all
 

385
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,029
now as you do that this is all
tightening so it's just got super super

386
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:52,039
tightening so it's just got super super
 

387
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,510
tightening so it's just got super super
tight secure the arm then drop straight

388
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
tight secure the arm then drop straight
 

389
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,830
tight secure the arm then drop straight
down up and over right when you get to

390
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:58,840
down up and over right when you get to
 

391
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,430
down up and over right when you get to
that nice tight spot you know now if I

392
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,440
that nice tight spot you know now if I
 

393
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,150
that nice tight spot you know now if I
did this in one really fast motion I'd

394
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
did this in one really fast motion I'd
 

395
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,909
did this in one really fast motion I'd
probably damage that shoulder if she's

396
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
probably damage that shoulder if she's
 

397
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,350
probably damage that shoulder if she's
like Gumby and I'm going to do a pin

398
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
like Gumby and I'm going to do a pin
 

399
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,869
like Gumby and I'm going to do a pin
kind of bad so you can see if she's like

400
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:06,879
kind of bad so you can see if she's like
 

401
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,070
kind of bad so you can see if she's like
Gumby and I'm way over here and she's

402
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
Gumby and I'm way over here and she's
 

403
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,790
Gumby and I'm way over here and she's
still not tapping then I'm going to bend

404
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:09,800
still not tapping then I'm going to bend
 

405
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,189
still not tapping then I'm going to bend
that elbow lock it to me and I'm going

406
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
that elbow lock it to me and I'm going
 

407
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,950
that elbow lock it to me and I'm going
to turn the hand up now when I do that

408
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
to turn the hand up now when I do that
 

409
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,110
to turn the hand up now when I do that
after I bend the elbow I'm just trying

410
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,120
after I bend the elbow I'm just trying
 

411
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,510
after I bend the elbow I'm just trying
to get her hand to go to her head like

412
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
to get her hand to go to her head like
 

413
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,670
to get her hand to go to her head like
this right everyone will tap from this

414
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
this right everyone will tap from this
 

415
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,029
this right everyone will tap from this
right I mean maybe maybe there's some

416
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
right I mean maybe maybe there's some
 

417
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,670
right I mean maybe maybe there's some
contortionists who wouldn't but 99% of

418
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
contortionists who wouldn't but 99% of
 

419
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,869
contortionists who wouldn't but 99% of
people will tap from this right I've

420
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:22,879
people will tap from this right I've
 

421
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,550
people will tap from this right I've
taken like you know little super

422
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
taken like you know little super
 

423
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,670
taken like you know little super
flexible gymnast 11-year-old girls and

424
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
flexible gymnast 11-year-old girls and
 

425
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,990
flexible gymnast 11-year-old girls and
you're able to do this because this

426
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,000
you're able to do this because this
 

427
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,790
you're able to do this because this
takes all all the stretch out of that

428
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
takes all all the stretch out of that
 

429
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,469
takes all all the stretch out of that
arm right so even a really flexible

430
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
arm right so even a really flexible
 

431
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,510
arm right so even a really flexible
person you're going to get them like

432
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,520

 

433
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,670

that okay so um the basic idea of this

434
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
that okay so um the basic idea of this
 

435
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,710
that okay so um the basic idea of this
is whenever I'm doing a pen whether it's

436
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:43,720
is whenever I'm doing a pen whether it's
 

437
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,070
is whenever I'm doing a pen whether it's
from a regular UDA or a Gak UD I drop

438
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
from a regular UDA or a Gak UD I drop
 

439
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,909
from a regular UDA or a Gak UD I drop
the inside knee first when I'm doing

440
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:48,919
the inside knee first when I'm doing
 

441
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,710
the inside knee first when I'm doing
that I make sure that their shoulder

442
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
that I make sure that their shoulder
 

443
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,629
that I make sure that their shoulder
precedes my knee so my knee doesn't make

444
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
precedes my knee so my knee doesn't make
 

445
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,430
precedes my knee so my knee doesn't make
contact till the shoulders already hit

446
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,440
contact till the shoulders already hit
 

447
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,950
contact till the shoulders already hit
if someone's really lacking flexibility

448
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
if someone's really lacking flexibility
 

449
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,990
if someone's really lacking flexibility
that might be enough to get them to tap

450
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,000
that might be enough to get them to tap
 

451
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,230
that might be enough to get them to tap
right then in there then if I can't get

452
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,240
right then in there then if I can't get
 

453
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,749
right then in there then if I can't get
them to tap there I lock it in I use my

454
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
them to tap there I lock it in I use my
 

455
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,309
them to tap there I lock it in I use my
leg to drive their arm forward most

456
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
leg to drive their arm forward most
 

457
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,749
leg to drive their arm forward most
adults will start to tap in that range

458
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:08,759
adults will start to tap in that range
 

459
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,670
adults will start to tap in that range
Okay then if that doesn't work I

460
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:10,680
Okay then if that doesn't work I
 

461
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,710
Okay then if that doesn't work I
continue with the leg towards the head

462
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
continue with the leg towards the head
 

463
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,230
continue with the leg towards the head
and secure the arm along my body 90% of

464
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
and secure the arm along my body 90% of
 

465
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,909
and secure the arm along my body 90% of
full adults are going to B are going to

466
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
full adults are going to B are going to
 

467
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,189
full adults are going to B are going to
tap at this point now if that doesn't

468
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:20,199
tap at this point now if that doesn't
 

469
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,510
tap at this point now if that doesn't
work I'm going to bend the elbow and

470
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
work I'm going to bend the elbow and
 

471
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,469
work I'm going to bend the elbow and
crank the hand towards the head and then

472
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:23,479
crank the hand towards the head and then
 

473
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,589
crank the hand towards the head and then
that will get probably 99.9% of people

474
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:26,599
that will get probably 99.9% of people
 

475
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,790
that will get probably 99.9% of people
to tap because it just takes all the

476
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
to tap because it just takes all the
 

477
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,029
to tap because it just takes all the
slack out of the arm entirely so that's

478
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
slack out of the arm entirely so that's
 

479
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,909
slack out of the arm entirely so that's
the basic process depending on what pen

480
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:32,919
the basic process depending on what pen
 

481
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,709
the basic process depending on what pen
you're using there are slight variations

482
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
you're using there are slight variations
 

483
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,949
you're using there are slight variations
on each of those depending on if it's a

484
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:35,959
on each of those depending on if it's a
 

485
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,190
on each of those depending on if it's a
Niko pin or a goo pin or a Sano pin but

486
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
Niko pin or a goo pin or a Sano pin but
 

487
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,949
Niko pin or a goo pin or a Sano pin but
all of them have that same exact

488
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
all of them have that same exact
 

489
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,670
all of them have that same exact
structure right so that structure will

490
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:42,680
structure right so that structure will
 

491
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,430
structure right so that structure will
be consistent if you can Master this

492
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:44,440
be consistent if you can Master this
 

493
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,310
be consistent if you can Master this
structure your pins will go through the

494
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
structure your pins will go through the
 

495
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,829
structure your pins will go through the
roof right away so your pins will get

496
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
roof right away so your pins will get
 

497
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,710
roof right away so your pins will get
better

498
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
better
 

499
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,430
better
immediately irregardless of the or

500
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
immediately irregardless of the or
 

501
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,470
immediately irregardless of the or
regardless regardless of the um the

502
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
regardless regardless of the um the
 

503
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,990
regardless regardless of the um the
detail of that pin right so the Sano

504
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,000
detail of that pin right so the Sano
 

505
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,750
detail of that pin right so the Sano
adds a little more wrist twisting in it

506
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:58,760
adds a little more wrist twisting in it
 

507
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,670
adds a little more wrist twisting in it
the Niko adds a little more elbow

508
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:00,680
the Niko adds a little more elbow
 

509
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,030
the Niko adds a little more elbow
emphasis in it the rokio adds elbow

510
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
emphasis in it the rokio adds elbow
 

511
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,430
emphasis in it the rokio adds elbow
wrist emphasis um so different ones

512
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
wrist emphasis um so different ones
 

513
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,110
wrist emphasis um so different ones
require or have slightly different

514
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
require or have slightly different
 

515
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,990
require or have slightly different
emphasis but that is the main structure

516
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,000
emphasis but that is the main structure
 

517
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,670
emphasis but that is the main structure
of all of them all right so I hope you
