00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,409

00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
and this is a that looks like a block to
 

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,450

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,850

this now becomes a training Vector in

the embryonic phase
 

159
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,249
the embryonic phase
so this part would never happen in the

160
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:16,259
so this part would never happen in the
 

161
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,890
so this part would never happen in the
technique okay this is the embryonic

162
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:18,900
technique okay this is the embryonic
 

163
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,010

training so now you I use this Vector

164
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,020

165
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,310

all right so when I use this vector

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,029

no

182
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039

 

183
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,830

here

184
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
here
 

185
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,909
here
parallel with the deck okay then comes

186
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:58,919
parallel with the deck okay then comes
 

187
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,409
parallel with the deck okay then comes
in the move

188
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:00,419
in the move
 

189
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,870
in the move
the embryonic

190
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
the embryonic
 

191
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,469
the embryonic
that's not me

192
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479

 

193
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:14,210

get your weapon parallel with the deck

194
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,220

 

195
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,150

that's the minimum okay

196
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,160
that's the minimum okay
 

197
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,550
that's the minimum okay
you also though don't want it pointing

198
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,560
you also though don't want it pointing
 

199
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,409
you also though don't want it pointing
down

200
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:21,419
down
 

201
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,530
down
boom parallel the deck and then begin

202
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:28,540

 

203
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,370

[Applause]

204
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:31,380
[Applause]
 

205
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,710
[Applause]
okay let's try it together

206
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,720
okay let's try it together
 

207
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,529
okay let's try it together
all right so try to understand so I'm

208
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:36,539
all right so try to understand so I'm
 

209
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,629
all right so try to understand so I'm
going to give the opening but I'm going

210
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
going to give the opening but I'm going
 

211
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,830
going to give the opening but I'm going
to take that line on the center line

212
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840

 

213
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,650

so I don't want to go here pass it

214
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:45,660
so I don't want to go here pass it
 

215
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,590
so I don't want to go here pass it
you see that okay

216
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:48,600
you see that okay
 

217
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,570
you see that okay
and I definitely don't want my tip out

218
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,580
and I definitely don't want my tip out
 

219
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,610
and I definitely don't want my tip out
of this fight because I'll never get it

220
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:52,620
of this fight because I'll never get it
 

221
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,529
of this fight because I'll never get it
there on time

222
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:54,539
there on time
 

223
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,150
there on time
so he's moving I go to the center line

224
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,160
so he's moving I go to the center line
 

225
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,370
so he's moving I go to the center line
engage the center line I sense the

226
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,380
engage the center line I sense the
 

227
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,830
engage the center line I sense the
weapon is coming around and I sense that

228
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
weapon is coming around and I sense that
 

229
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,469
weapon is coming around and I sense that
I got a nearer Target than his face

230
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
I got a nearer Target than his face
 

231
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,629
I got a nearer Target than his face
okay

232
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
okay
 

233
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,969
okay
so my path is here

234
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:13,979

 

235
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,990

away from the embryonic timing again

236
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,000
away from the embryonic timing again
 

237
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,730
away from the embryonic timing again
whether it's embryonic or it's the

238
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740
whether it's embryonic or it's the
 

239
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,249
whether it's embryonic or it's the
actual technique has nothing to do with

240
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:22,259
actual technique has nothing to do with
 

241
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,170
actual technique has nothing to do with
intensity so you can do the actual

242
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,180
intensity so you can do the actual
 

243
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,670
intensity so you can do the actual
timing

244
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
timing
 

245
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,150
timing
less intense okay it depends on how much

246
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,160
less intense okay it depends on how much
 

247
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,670
less intense okay it depends on how much
I can process information meaning am I

248
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
I can process information meaning am I
 

249
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,529
I can process information meaning am I
doing the form correctly can I assess my

250
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:33,539
doing the form correctly can I assess my
 

251
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,990
doing the form correctly can I assess my
performance yes or no and then how much

252
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
performance yes or no and then how much
 

253
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,270
performance yes or no and then how much
value it can take that's that's the

254
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,280
value it can take that's that's the
 

255
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,770
value it can take that's that's the
intensity question not whether it's

256
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:39,780
intensity question not whether it's
 

257
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,809
intensity question not whether it's
embryonic or not okay

258
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:41,819
embryonic or not okay
 

259
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,790
embryonic or not okay
so I'm around this is dynamic

260
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800

 

261
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,330

killing his Joe in in the stress

262
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,340

 

263
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,029

you'll see the threat right there

264
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,039
you'll see the threat right there
 

265
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,309
you'll see the threat right there
then you'll feel his threat so

266
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
then you'll feel his threat so
 

267
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,550
then you'll feel his threat so
that of Tosh has to go into his Center

268
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,560
that of Tosh has to go into his Center
 

269
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,129
that of Tosh has to go into his Center
cannot just stay out on his hands

270
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:07,139
cannot just stay out on his hands
 

271
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,780
cannot just stay out on his hands
you want his feet checked

272
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:09,790
you want his feet checked
 

273
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,330
you want his feet checked
[Music]

274
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:11,340
[Music]
 

275
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,450
[Music]
so that he stands still and provides the

276
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,460
so that he stands still and provides the
 

277
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,089
so that he stands still and provides the
necessary resistance for the atoshizuki

278
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,099
necessary resistance for the atoshizuki
 

279
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,850
necessary resistance for the atoshizuki
okay let's go

280
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:19,860
okay let's go
 

281
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,670
okay let's go
so your Keyhole assumes like all this

282
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
so your Keyhole assumes like all this
 

283
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,589
so your Keyhole assumes like all this
kind of understanding of the weapon

284
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:24,599
kind of understanding of the weapon
 

285
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,450
kind of understanding of the weapon
fighting okay so uh for example he goes

286
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,460
fighting okay so uh for example he goes
 

287
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,050
fighting okay so uh for example he goes
this is this is this is not a weapon

288
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,060
this is this is this is not a weapon
 

289
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,909
this is this is this is not a weapon
fight

290
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:34,919
fight
 

291
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,870
fight
I I'm here passive I sit here like this

292
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
I I'm here passive I sit here like this
 

293
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,930
I I'm here passive I sit here like this
well now I'm blocking okay and I would

294
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:41,940
well now I'm blocking okay and I would
 

295
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,730
well now I'm blocking okay and I would
just hit that thing as hard as I could

296
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:43,740
just hit that thing as hard as I could
 

297
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,310
just hit that thing as hard as I could
and then come in with my follow-ups

298
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
and then come in with my follow-ups
 

299
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,750
and then come in with my follow-ups
okay

300
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
okay
 

301
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,970
okay
it's not Aikido either because you block

302
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:49,980
it's not Aikido either because you block
 

303
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,110
it's not Aikido either because you block
it

304
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
it
 

305
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,170
it
this passivity too is

306
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,180
this passivity too is
 

307
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,769
this passivity too is
okay so for example let's just take a

308
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:57,779
okay so for example let's just take a
 

309
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,090
okay so for example let's just take a
basic keyhorn of kihon Wasa of ikeo okay

310
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,100
basic keyhorn of kihon Wasa of ikeo okay
 

311
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,449
basic keyhorn of kihon Wasa of ikeo okay
so the same thing I don't sit here and

312
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:05,459
so the same thing I don't sit here and
 

313
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,490
so the same thing I don't sit here and
then do you go from there

314
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:07,500
then do you go from there
 

315
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,449
then do you go from there
there is a meeting we meet I met and we

316
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:11,459
there is a meeting we meet I met and we
 

317
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,910
there is a meeting we meet I met and we
go right into the technique right

318
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
go right into the technique right
 

319
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,790
go right into the technique right
there's a connection that is establish

320
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
there's a connection that is establish
 

321
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,009
there's a connection that is establish
that connection first starts

322
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:19,019
that connection first starts
 

323
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,470
that connection first starts
immaterially

324
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
immaterially
 

325
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,190
immaterially
got it and it'll continue from there so

326
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
got it and it'll continue from there so
 

327
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,410
got it and it'll continue from there so
when I go here it's there's no

328
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:27,420
when I go here it's there's no
 

329
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,810
when I go here it's there's no
connection I wrote connection to do this

330
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:29,820
connection I wrote connection to do this
 

331
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,550
connection I wrote connection to do this
and then you'll have a material

332
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
and then you'll have a material
 

333
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,550
and then you'll have a material
connection this is not correct

334
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
connection this is not correct
 

335
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,910
connection this is not correct
instead it's an immaterial connection he

336
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
instead it's an immaterial connection he
 

337
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,090
instead it's an immaterial connection he
goes connections still you see well this

338
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,100
goes connections still you see well this
 

339
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,269
goes connections still you see well this
connection is keeping him from coming

340
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:44,279
connection is keeping him from coming
 

341
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,650
connection is keeping him from coming
straight in

342
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,660
straight in
 

343
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,350
straight in
do you understand and that's why he's

344
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,360
do you understand and that's why he's
 

345
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,370
do you understand and that's why he's
got to go around

346
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,380

 

347
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,930

doesn't look like it you're actually

348
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:53,940
doesn't look like it you're actually
 

349
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,530
doesn't look like it you're actually
doing something that generates something

350
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,540
doing something that generates something
 

351
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,710
doing something that generates something
in him okay so around

352
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
in him okay so around
 

353
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,710
in him okay so around
okay if I stay here it would not

354
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
okay if I stay here it would not
 

355
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,970
okay if I stay here it would not
generate him staying out there at weapon

356
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:10,980
generate him staying out there at weapon
 

357
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,130
generate him staying out there at weapon
range he would keep coming in because he

358
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,140
range he would keep coming in because he
 

359
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,670
range he would keep coming in because he
knocked my weapon out and now we're in

360
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
knocked my weapon out and now we're in
 

361
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,790
knocked my weapon out and now we're in
grappling ring so to see or ski range

362
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:19,800
grappling ring so to see or ski range
 

363
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,230
grappling ring so to see or ski range
Okay so

364
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,240
Okay so
 

365
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,389
Okay so
what I'm doing instead that's keeping

366
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
what I'm doing instead that's keeping
 

367
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,430
what I'm doing instead that's keeping
them out is

368
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
them out is
 

369
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,750
them out is
now we're in Striking Joe range okay got

370
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
now we're in Striking Joe range okay got
 

371
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,130
now we're in Striking Joe range okay got
it

372
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,140
it
 

373
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,509
it
but

374
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:32,519
but
 

375
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,850
but
what happens sometimes

376
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:34,860
what happens sometimes
 

377
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,030
what happens sometimes
when we go to the actual timing is we're

378
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,040
when we go to the actual timing is we're
 

379
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,590
when we go to the actual timing is we're
coming in

380
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
coming in
 

381
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,810
coming in
you see and we came in now and same

382
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:41,820
you see and we came in now and same
 

383
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,870
you see and we came in now and same
thing I would just charge me at that

384
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
thing I would just charge me at that
 

385
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,490
thing I would just charge me at that
point

386
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:46,500
point
 

387
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,970
point
because he's already there

388
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:49,980

 

389
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,009

you got to be careful as you go to hit

390
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:52,019
you got to be careful as you go to hit
 

391
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,870
you got to be careful as you go to hit
the hands that you're not

392
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
the hands that you're not
 

393
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,150
the hands that you're not
keeping yourself in range

394
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
keeping yourself in range
 

395
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,329
keeping yourself in range
and not creating another opening so as

396
00:10:59,329 --> 00:10:59,339
and not creating another opening so as
 

397
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,730
and not creating another opening so as
you're doing the timing do you see

398
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:01,740
you're doing the timing do you see
 

399
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,069
you're doing the timing do you see
you're not in any different range than

400
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
you're not in any different range than
 

401
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,350
you're not in any different range than
the embryonic level

402
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,360
the embryonic level
 

403
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,889
the embryonic level
s nothing changes

404
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:09,899

 

405
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,590

I'm not closing and moving up the circle

406
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm not closing and moving up the circle
 

407
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,509
I'm not closing and moving up the circle
okay all right let's try it again

408
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519

 

409
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,250

let's pay attention to the kiss

410
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,260
let's pay attention to the kiss
 

411
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,550
let's pay attention to the kiss
so when I move around that the weapon is

412
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
so when I move around that the weapon is
 

413
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,790
so when I move around that the weapon is
oriented towards him weapons oriented

414
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:25,800
oriented towards him weapons oriented
 

415
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,030
oriented towards him weapons oriented
person is a threat there right this

416
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
person is a threat there right this
 

417
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,030
person is a threat there right this
movement could be doubles

418
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,040
movement could be doubles
 

419
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,990
movement could be doubles
and he does a reaction that's when I

420
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
and he does a reaction that's when I
 

421
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,170
and he does a reaction that's when I
come around replace it with the back end

422
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,180
come around replace it with the back end
 

423
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,009
come around replace it with the back end
this is very similar showman with the

424
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,019
this is very similar showman with the
 

425
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,530
this is very similar showman with the
weapon out on the side

426
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,540
weapon out on the side
 

427
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,230
weapon out on the side
so I don't want to go like this

428
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
so I don't want to go like this
 

429
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,030
so I don't want to go like this
and then walk

430
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
and then walk
 

431
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,150
and then walk
you you get it there's you have that

432
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,160
you you get it there's you have that
 

433
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,630
you you get it there's you have that
that initial ski

434
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:55,640
that initial ski
 

435
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,630
that initial ski
and then it disappears and you come over

436
00:11:59,630 --> 00:11:59,640
and then it disappears and you come over
 

437
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,550
and then it disappears and you come over
so don't pull it out from here and

438
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,560
so don't pull it out from here and
 

439
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,829
so don't pull it out from here and
you're walking in entirely

440
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
you're walking in entirely
 

441
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,410
you're walking in entirely
like that

442
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:05,420
like that
 

443
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,970
like that
you could just even be just a weight

444
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:07,980
you could just even be just a weight
 

445
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,310
you could just even be just a weight
shift in that's enough for their

446
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
shift in that's enough for their
 

447
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,889
shift in that's enough for their
training purposes in then replace wait

448
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:15,899

 

449
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,290

in replace

450
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,300

 

451
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,030

and replace it

452
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
and replace it
 

453
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,730
and replace it
okay let's try it go so when we're

454
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:25,740
okay let's try it go so when we're
 

455
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,310
okay let's try it go so when we're
reviewing let's do the test out review

456
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
reviewing let's do the test out review
 

457
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,210
reviewing let's do the test out review
I was trying I I don't have my

458
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,220
I was trying I I don't have my
 

459
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,490
I was trying I I don't have my
lats and shoulders and arms in it I'm

460
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:34,500
lats and shoulders and arms in it I'm
 

461
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,670
lats and shoulders and arms in it I'm
trying to just let my body my body moves

462
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
trying to just let my body my body moves
 

463
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,930
trying to just let my body my body moves
the weapon body is moving the weapon

464
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:41,940
the weapon body is moving the weapon
 

465
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,810
the weapon body is moving the weapon
my body's moving away

my body's moving away
 

467
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,910
my body's moving away
that's all I'm doing so same thing on

468
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:46,920
that's all I'm doing so same thing on
 

469
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,110
that's all I'm doing so same thing on
Showman

470
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,120
Showman
 

471
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,530
Showman
I'm not gonna

472
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:50,540
I'm not gonna
 

473
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,750

generating okay got it you're not

480
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:02,579
generating okay got it you're not
 

481
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,970
generating okay got it you're not
otherwise we're gonna break the Joe's so

482
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:04,980
otherwise we're gonna break the Joe's so
 

483
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,389
otherwise we're gonna break the Joe's so
again emphasize the form as opposed to

484
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
again emphasize the form as opposed to
 

485
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,530
again emphasize the form as opposed to
the effect on the Joe okay try it again

486
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:11,540
the effect on the Joe okay try it again
 

487
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,970
the effect on the Joe okay try it again
so let's say I'm doing the show One G

488
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:13,980
so let's say I'm doing the show One G
 

489
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,030
so let's say I'm doing the show One G
weapon out again wiping out again

490
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
weapon out again wiping out again
 

491
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,150
weapon out again wiping out again
okay it's very common in Aikido so I

492
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
okay it's very common in Aikido so I
 

493
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,949
okay it's very common in Aikido so I
come around and you have this

494
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
come around and you have this
 

495
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,069
come around and you have this
back foot ruddering problem okay this is

496
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:25,079
back foot ruddering problem okay this is
 

497
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,430
back foot ruddering problem okay this is
totally not even external by

498
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
totally not even external by
 

499
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,009
totally not even external by
biomechanics okay body mechanics

500
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:31,019
biomechanics okay body mechanics
 

501
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,129
biomechanics okay body mechanics
so you gotta watch that rendering

502
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:34,139
so you gotta watch that rendering
 

503
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,470
so you gotta watch that rendering
not it

504
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
not it
 

505
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,650
not it
all I did on this cut here is I came

506
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:39,660
all I did on this cut here is I came
 

507
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,290
all I did on this cut here is I came
around so there's like so many giggy

508
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,300
around so there's like so many giggy
 

509
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,090
around so there's like so many giggy
because all I did was change the front

510
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,100
because all I did was change the front
 

511
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,769
because all I did was change the front
half

512
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:45,779
half
 

513
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,750
half
that's all I did okay you get some

514
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:50,760
that's all I did okay you get some
 

515
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,350
that's all I did okay you get some
rotation on the front hip but this is

516
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,360
rotation on the front hip but this is
 

517
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,170
rotation on the front hip but this is
now taken away from my Mass from the

518
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,180
now taken away from my Mass from the
 

519
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,949
now taken away from my Mass from the
force equation Okay so

520
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
force equation Okay so
 

521
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,370
force equation Okay so
here's what I was doing Showman

522
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:04,380
here's what I was doing Showman
 

523
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,870
here's what I was doing Showman
I'd be here

524
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:05,880
I'd be here
 

525
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,449
I'd be here
not here I shouldn't be there

526
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:08,459
not here I shouldn't be there
 

527
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,269
not here I shouldn't be there
same way just says my hand is changing

528
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:14,279

 

529
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,810

no

530
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:17,820

 

531
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,269

straight in

532
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:20,279
straight in
 

533
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,569
straight in
straight in okay let's try it again

534
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:22,579
straight in okay let's try it again
 

535
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:25,310
straight in okay let's try it again
embryonically he's gonna go Showman

536
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:25,320
embryonically he's gonna go Showman
 

537
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,710
embryonically he's gonna go Showman
yes exact same okay

538
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:27,720
yes exact same okay
 

539
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,030
yes exact same okay
so if you're gonna go

540
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
so if you're gonna go
 

541
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,370
so if you're gonna go
whoa again

542
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:34,380
whoa again
 

543
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,250
whoa again
I'm going to start clearing the line

544
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm going to start clearing the line
 

545
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,910
I'm going to start clearing the line
here okay then I move off the lines

546
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:40,920
here okay then I move off the lines
 

547
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,009
here okay then I move off the lines
embryonically this is now a training

548
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:43,019
embryonically this is now a training
 

549
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:46,790
embryonically this is now a training
Vector I move off the line come down the

550
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
Vector I move off the line come down the
 

551
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,050
Vector I move off the line come down the
hill

552
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,060

 

553
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,650

so one two

554
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:57,660
so one two
 

555
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:05,750
so one two
three reasons yeah

556
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760

 

557
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,250

one

558
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,260
one
 

559
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:16,069
one
two three and

560
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079

 

561
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,470

four

562
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480

 

563
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,389

okay embryonically like that again every

564
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:23,399
okay embryonically like that again every
 

565
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,829
okay embryonically like that again every
dominant plate

566
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
dominant plate
 

567
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,610
dominant plate
what's that look like on that first move

568
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:28,620
what's that look like on that first move
 

569
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,670
what's that look like on that first move
what's it look like a block but that's

570
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
what's it look like a block but that's
 

571
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,710
what's it look like a block but that's
just embryonic that's not how it's gonna

572
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:33,720
just embryonic that's not how it's gonna
 

573
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,889
just embryonic that's not how it's gonna
be okay it's gonna be another stop hit

574
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:36,899
be okay it's gonna be another stop hit
 

575
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,730
be okay it's gonna be another stop hit
in the middle of his striking okay let's

576
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:40,740
in the middle of his striking okay let's
 

577
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,769
in the middle of his striking okay let's
get there though okay so this is another

578
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:42,779
get there though okay so this is another
 

579
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,530
get there though okay so this is another
problematic one in Sancho 2 for you guys

580
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:45,540
problematic one in Sancho 2 for you guys
 

581
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,530
problematic one in Sancho 2 for you guys
you guys okay so uh go back to the

582
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:48,540
you guys okay so uh go back to the
 

583
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,990
you guys okay so uh go back to the
basics don't hold the end of the weapon

584
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,000
basics don't hold the end of the weapon
 

585
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,930
basics don't hold the end of the weapon
like that always give yourself some

586
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:53,940
like that always give yourself some
 

587
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,329
like that always give yourself some
space on the end so you can all you're

588
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:56,339
space on the end so you can all you're
 

589
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,370
space on the end so you can all you're
always ready to use it it's the same on

590
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:58,380
always ready to use it it's the same on
 

591
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,829
always ready to use it it's the same on
the knife you you don't hold the Palm up

592
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:00,839
the knife you you don't hold the Palm up
 

593
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,430
the knife you you don't hold the Palm up
okay you got some space there here also

594
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,440
okay you got some space there here also
 

595
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,210
okay you got some space there here also
that corner of your leverage weapons uh

596
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,220
that corner of your leverage weapons uh
 

597
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,250
that corner of your leverage weapons uh
they can it that corner can start to

598
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:10,260
they can it that corner can start to
 

599
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,110
they can it that corner can start to
fall from out of your grip and stuff so

600
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,120
fall from out of your grip and stuff so
 

601
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,790
fall from out of your grip and stuff so
you don't want that you always have some

602
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:13,800
you don't want that you always have some
 

603
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,790
you don't want that you always have some
space there okay and then you have third

604
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
space there okay and then you have third
 

605
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,970
space there okay and then you have third
joke your your neutral position is

606
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:19,980
joke your your neutral position is
 

607
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,129
joke your your neutral position is
always sir Joe third Joe is marked by

608
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:22,139
always sir Joe third Joe is marked by
 

609
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,870
always sir Joe third Joe is marked by
your shoulder width you don't want to be

610
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:23,880
your shoulder width you don't want to be
 

611
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,069
your shoulder width you don't want to be
a half jump okay so I'm at third Joe

612
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
a half jump okay so I'm at third Joe
 

613
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,290
a half jump okay so I'm at third Joe
he's going to come around

614
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,300
he's going to come around
 

615
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,269
he's going to come around
right and I will move this left hand

616
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
right and I will move this left hand
 

617
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,329
right and I will move this left hand
to the third Joe position on the other

618
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:38,339
to the third Joe position on the other
 

619
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,790
to the third Joe position on the other
side I just have to learn where it is

620
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
side I just have to learn where it is
 

621
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,009
side I just have to learn where it is
okay so I don't want to go all the way

622
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,019
okay so I don't want to go all the way
 

623
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,410
okay so I don't want to go all the way
to the end

624
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:45,420
to the end
 

625
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,550
to the end
because I won't have much leverage here

626
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:49,560
because I won't have much leverage here
 

627
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,910
because I won't have much leverage here
so I have to move this hand to what is

628
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920
so I have to move this hand to what is
 

629
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,910
so I have to move this hand to what is
going to be the third show

630
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
going to be the third show
 

631
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,629
going to be the third show
on the other side got it okay so you

632
00:16:59,629 --> 00:16:59,639
on the other side got it okay so you
 

633
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,410
on the other side got it okay so you
just have to start here start there he

634
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:03,420
just have to start here start there he
 

635
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,870
just have to start here start there he
goes and you're fine and I will move

636
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:05,880
goes and you're fine and I will move
 

637
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,289
goes and you're fine and I will move
this hand over to third Joe to the other

638
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,299
this hand over to third Joe to the other
 

639
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,789
this hand over to third Joe to the other
side

640
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
side
 

641
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,309
side
see that and then I have an I'll have

642
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:13,319
see that and then I have an I'll have
 

643
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,610
see that and then I have an I'll have
enough weapon and enough Leverage

644
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:16,620
enough weapon and enough Leverage
 

645
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,390
enough weapon and enough Leverage
to slap that thing down okay

646
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
to slap that thing down okay
 

647
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,390
to slap that thing down okay
and so now we'll go out of embryonic and

648
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,400
and so now we'll go out of embryonic and
 

649
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,669
and so now we'll go out of embryonic and
we'll go through the techniques does

650
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
we'll go through the techniques does
 

651
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,669
we'll go through the techniques does
that look right no that's not right so

652
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:28,679
that look right no that's not right so
 

653
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,650
that look right no that's not right so
very dynamic

654
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:30,660
very dynamic
 

655
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,810
very dynamic
instant

656
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:32,820
instant
 

657
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,169
instant
hand attack and staff very Dynamic but

658
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:36,179
hand attack and staff very Dynamic but
 

659
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:46,870
hand attack and staff very Dynamic but
it's passing through that cross

660
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880

 

661
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,600

okay let's go
