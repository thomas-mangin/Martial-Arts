00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,950

Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:02,960
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
 

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,910
Hi, I'm Christopher Hine and today we're
going to talk about positions in Iikido.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
going to talk about positions in Iikido.
 

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,430
going to talk about positions in Iikido.
So, I'm going to talk to you guys about

6
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
So, I'm going to talk to you guys about
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,509
So, I'm going to talk to you guys about
the primary positions and I I'm pretty

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
the primary positions and I I'm pretty
 

9
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,709
the primary positions and I I'm pretty
sure I've made a video on that before,

10
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
sure I've made a video on that before,
 

11
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,910
sure I've made a video on that before,
but we're going to go back over what the

12
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
but we're going to go back over what the
 

13
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,709
but we're going to go back over what the
primary positions are, what a is, what

14
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
primary positions are, what a is, what
 

15
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,630
primary positions are, what a is, what
the secondary positions are, and what

16
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
the secondary positions are, and what
 

17
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,550
the secondary positions are, and what
the tertiary positions are, and how

18
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
the tertiary positions are, and how
 

19
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,429
the tertiary positions are, and how
those naturally lead to a progression of

20
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
those naturally lead to a progression of
 

21
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,150
those naturally lead to a progression of
what the techniques are in Iikido. um

22
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
what the techniques are in Iikido. um
 

23
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,310
what the techniques are in Iikido. um
outside of uh some of the stuff that's

24
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
outside of uh some of the stuff that's
 

25
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,070
outside of uh some of the stuff that's
the the more joint specific stuff you

26
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
the the more joint specific stuff you
 

27
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,550
the the more joint specific stuff you
might call it consetsu waza or has a lot

28
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
might call it consetsu waza or has a lot
 

29
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,310
might call it consetsu waza or has a lot
of the kilowaza stuff. So how the

30
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
of the kilowaza stuff. So how the
 

31
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,229
of the kilowaza stuff. So how the
nagwaza plays out from those positional

32
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:35,239
nagwaza plays out from those positional
 

33
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,270
nagwaza plays out from those positional
orientations it'll make more sense when

34
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
orientations it'll make more sense when
 

35
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,709
orientations it'll make more sense when
I show it to you. I'm going to get Josh

36
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
I show it to you. I'm going to get Josh
 

37
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,270
I show it to you. I'm going to get Josh
out here. We're going to go to work.

38
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,280

 

39
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,630

Josh. All right. So let's talk about

40
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
Josh. All right. So let's talk about
 

41
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,910
Josh. All right. So let's talk about
positions a secondary positions tertiary

42
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
positions a secondary positions tertiary
 

43
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,910
positions a secondary positions tertiary
positions and technique and how that all

44
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
positions and technique and how that all
 

45
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,430
positions and technique and how that all
interplays. So, I'm pretty sure I've

46
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
interplays. So, I'm pretty sure I've
 

47
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,549
interplays. So, I'm pretty sure I've
made a video guide for you guys before

48
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
made a video guide for you guys before
 

49
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,229
made a video guide for you guys before
about primary positions, but let's just

50
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
about primary positions, but let's just
 

51
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,510
about primary positions, but let's just
quickly review what the primary

52
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
quickly review what the primary
 

53
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,110
quickly review what the primary
positions are. Now, these are not

54
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
positions are. Now, these are not
 

55
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,110
positions are. Now, these are not
tinoinko. These are not how I get to the

56
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
tinoinko. These are not how I get to the
 

57
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,630
tinoinko. These are not how I get to the
positions. These are just the positions

58
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
positions. These are just the positions
 

59
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,790
positions. These are just the positions
that we talk about in iikido. So, the

60
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
that we talk about in iikido. So, the
 

61
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,509
that we talk about in iikido. So, the
first position is muhani. And that means

62
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
first position is muhani. And that means
 

63
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,990
first position is muhani. And that means
without hanmi. So, I don't have a hanmi

64
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
without hanmi. So, I don't have a hanmi
 

65
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,750
without hanmi. So, I don't have a hanmi
here. And the reason we refer to it that

66
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
here. And the reason we refer to it that
 

67
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,350
here. And the reason we refer to it that
way is because in iikido you should

68
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
way is because in iikido you should
 

69
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,429
way is because in iikido you should
always have hanmi. So, if you're in a no

70
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
always have hanmi. So, if you're in a no
 

71
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,429
always have hanmi. So, if you're in a no
hanmi situation, your primary objective

72
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
hanmi situation, your primary objective
 

73
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,749
hanmi situation, your primary objective
is to get hanmi at least, right? So,

74
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
is to get hanmi at least, right? So,
 

75
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,749
is to get hanmi at least, right? So,
hanmi would be either going this side or

76
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
hanmi would be either going this side or
 

77
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,030
hanmi would be either going this side or
this side. and we start to get a half

78
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
this side. and we start to get a half
 

79
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,030
this side. and we start to get a half
body position. If I were to move like

80
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
body position. If I were to move like
 

81
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,550
body position. If I were to move like
this, it's Iani because my left foot is

82
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
this, it's Iani because my left foot is
 

83
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,310
this, it's Iani because my left foot is
closest to his left foot and his left

84
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
closest to his left foot and his left
 

85
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,230
closest to his left foot and his left
foot's closest to mine. So by just

86
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
foot's closest to mine. So by just
 

87
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,350
foot's closest to mine. So by just
stepping, we don't have to change

88
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
stepping, we don't have to change
 

89
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,870
stepping, we don't have to change
anything. By just stepping like this, we

90
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
anything. By just stepping like this, we
 

91
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,789
anything. By just stepping like this, we
already have Ihani. Now, of course, the

92
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
already have Ihani. Now, of course, the
 

93
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,390
already have Ihani. Now, of course, the
same would be true on the other side. If

94
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
same would be true on the other side. If
 

95
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,149
same would be true on the other side. If
I step this way, I just have Iani on the

96
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
I step this way, I just have Iani on the
 

97
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,870
I step this way, I just have Iani on the
other side. So this would be U Migi Ian,

98
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
other side. So this would be U Migi Ian,
 

99
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,749
other side. So this would be U Migi Ian,
right side me Ian. Okay. Now, if I

100
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
right side me Ian. Okay. Now, if I
 

101
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,630
right side me Ian. Okay. Now, if I
rotate slightly like this, then I get

102
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
rotate slightly like this, then I get
 

103
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,670
rotate slightly like this, then I get
right. So if I'm trying to get off the

104
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
right. So if I'm trying to get off the
 

105
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,350
right. So if I'm trying to get off the
line and I go like this, that's now

106
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
line and I go like this, that's now
 

107
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,670
line and I go like this, that's now
gakuhani because his left foot's forward

108
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
gakuhani because his left foot's forward
 

109
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,190
gakuhani because his left foot's forward
and my right foot's forward. That's gaku

110
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
and my right foot's forward. That's gaku
 

111
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,789
and my right foot's forward. That's gaku
opposite. And of course, if I did the

112
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
opposite. And of course, if I did the
 

113
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,230
opposite. And of course, if I did the
same thing to the other side, that would

114
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
same thing to the other side, that would
 

115
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,230
same thing to the other side, that would
just be yakuhani over there. Right? So

116
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
just be yakuhani over there. Right? So
 

117
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,550
just be yakuhani over there. Right? So
there's our eye and gaku hani. Now those

118
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
there's our eye and gaku hani. Now those
 

119
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,709
there's our eye and gaku hani. Now those
positions are okay. They're better than

120
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
positions are okay. They're better than
 

121
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,990
positions are okay. They're better than
this position. This is the worst

122
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
this position. This is the worst
 

123
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,550
this position. This is the worst
position.

124
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,560
position.
 

125
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,550
position.
But is the next position up, right? And

126
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
But is the next position up, right? And
 

127
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,150
But is the next position up, right? And
for that, of course, we have yaku. We're

128
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
for that, of course, we have yaku. We're
 

129
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,390
for that, of course, we have yaku. We're
facing opposite directions. And I we're

130
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
facing opposite directions. And I we're
 

131
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,910
facing opposite directions. And I we're
facing same direction. And if you want

132
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
facing same direction. And if you want
 

133
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,430
facing same direction. And if you want
to get technical about a technique, you

134
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
to get technical about a technique, you
 

135
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,589
to get technical about a technique, you
could also have choku, which is 90

136
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
could also have choku, which is 90
 

137
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,510
could also have choku, which is 90
degrees to each other. So also you can

138
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
degrees to each other. So also you can
 

139
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,510
degrees to each other. So also you can
say that. And then the best position for

140
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
say that. And then the best position for
 

141
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,470
say that. And then the best position for
us is edimi. And we either have i edimi,

142
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
us is edimi. And we either have i edimi,
 

143
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,790
us is edimi. And we either have i edimi,
we're facing the same direction, choku

144
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
we're facing the same direction, choku
 

145
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,710
we're facing the same direction, choku
edimi, we're 90° to each other, or um

146
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
edimi, we're 90° to each other, or um
 

147
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,309
edimi, we're 90° to each other, or um
yaku edimi, we're facing opposite

148
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
yaku edimi, we're facing opposite
 

149
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,910
yaku edimi, we're facing opposite
direction of each other. Okay. So those

150
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
direction of each other. Okay. So those
 

151
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,750
direction of each other. Okay. So those
are the basic positions. And as we get

152
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
are the basic positions. And as we get
 

153
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,350
are the basic positions. And as we get
to the back position, they're improving

154
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
to the back position, they're improving
 

155
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,509
to the back position, they're improving
every time, right? So so you know this

156
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
every time, right? So so you know this
 

157
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,030
every time, right? So so you know this
position's not that good. This

158
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
position's not that good. This
 

159
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,710
position's not that good. This
position's slightly better. This

160
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
position's slightly better. This
 

161
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,390
position's slightly better. This
position's slightly better. This

162
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
position's slightly better. This
 

163
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,150
position's slightly better. This
position's better yet. Right? So, we're

164
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
position's better yet. Right? So, we're
 

165
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,270
position's better yet. Right? So, we're
getting better and better and better as

166
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
getting better and better and better as
 

167
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,110
getting better and better and better as
we start to go around. Okay? So, when

168
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
we start to go around. Okay? So, when
 

169
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,710
we start to go around. Okay? So, when
I'm dealing with this guy in time and

170
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
I'm dealing with this guy in time and
 

171
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,710
I'm dealing with this guy in time and
space, I'm always trying to get to a

172
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
space, I'm always trying to get to a
 

173
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,150
space, I'm always trying to get to a
better and better position. Right? So,

174
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
better and better position. Right? So,
 

175
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,550
better and better position. Right? So,
imagine if we were at far distance. If I

176
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
imagine if we were at far distance. If I
 

177
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,070
imagine if we were at far distance. If I
could get around to the back of this

178
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
could get around to the back of this
 

179
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,589
could get around to the back of this
guy, then that's exactly what I would

180
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
guy, then that's exactly what I would
 

181
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,790
guy, then that's exactly what I would
try to do. You know, if he wasn't paying

182
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
try to do. You know, if he wasn't paying
 

183
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,630
try to do. You know, if he wasn't paying
attention to me or too slow or whatever,

184
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
attention to me or too slow or whatever,
 

185
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,750
attention to me or too slow or whatever,
I'm going to I'm going to work my way

186
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm going to I'm going to work my way
 

187
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,430
I'm going to I'm going to work my way
behind him because he can do very little

188
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
behind him because he can do very little
 

189
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,869
behind him because he can do very little
to me if I'm behind him, much less than

190
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
to me if I'm behind him, much less than
 

191
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,990
to me if I'm behind him, much less than
he could do if I'm right in front of

192
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
he could do if I'm right in front of
 

193
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,509
he could do if I'm right in front of
him. Right? So, that's what I'm doing.

194
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
him. Right? So, that's what I'm doing.
 

195
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,070
him. Right? So, that's what I'm doing.
Okay? So that's the beginning idea of a

196
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
Okay? So that's the beginning idea of a
 

197
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,149
Okay? So that's the beginning idea of a
was. I'm blending with him, right? So

198
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
was. I'm blending with him, right? So
 

199
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,509
was. I'm blending with him, right? So
I'm making some kind of interaction with

200
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
I'm making some kind of interaction with
 

201
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,110
I'm making some kind of interaction with
him and trying to get a good position

202
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
him and trying to get a good position
 

203
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,149
him and trying to get a good position
for myself. Now, as I'm moving, if he's

204
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
for myself. Now, as I'm moving, if he's
 

205
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,589
for myself. Now, as I'm moving, if he's
chasing me down, of course, he's going

206
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
chasing me down, of course, he's going
 

207
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,350
chasing me down, of course, he's going
to adapt. So meaning if he was coming at

208
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
to adapt. So meaning if he was coming at
 

209
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,790
to adapt. So meaning if he was coming at
me, you got to go ultra ultra slow right

210
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:24,800
me, you got to go ultra ultra slow right
 

211
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,470
me, you got to go ultra ultra slow right
now, but if he's coming at me and I

212
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
now, but if he's coming at me and I
 

213
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,750
now, but if he's coming at me and I
start to go over here, he's going to of

214
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
start to go over here, he's going to of
 

215
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,350
start to go over here, he's going to of
course adapt. And now we have Muhani

216
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
course adapt. And now we have Muhani
 

217
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,789
course adapt. And now we have Muhani
again, right? You see, because I moved

218
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
again, right? You see, because I moved
 

219
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,070
again, right? You see, because I moved
over here and he moved over here, we

220
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
over here and he moved over here, we
 

221
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,550
over here and he moved over here, we
have Muhani. So most of the time when

222
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
have Muhani. So most of the time when
 

223
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,229
have Muhani. So most of the time when
you're starting to make a was with them,

224
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
you're starting to make a was with them,
 

225
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,910
you're starting to make a was with them,
they're just going to keep adjusting to

226
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
they're just going to keep adjusting to
 

227
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,149
they're just going to keep adjusting to
you. And so you'll always be in Muhani

228
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
you. And so you'll always be in Muhani
 

229
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,030
you. And so you'll always be in Muhani
and you're going to keep trying to get

230
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
and you're going to keep trying to get
 

231
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,309
and you're going to keep trying to get
out of Muhani and they're going to keep

232
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
out of Muhani and they're going to keep
 

233
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,910
out of Muhani and they're going to keep
trying to put you in Muhani because they

234
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
trying to put you in Muhani because they
 

235
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,350
trying to put you in Muhani because they
want you right in front of them so they

236
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
want you right in front of them so they
 

237
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,949
want you right in front of them so they
can get you. Right? So that's the

238
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
can get you. Right? So that's the
 

239
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,190
can get you. Right? So that's the
beginning of a was now as we get closer

240
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
beginning of a was now as we get closer
 

241
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,390
beginning of a was now as we get closer
and closer and closer. If we're in

242
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
and closer and closer. If we're in
 

243
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,390
and closer and closer. If we're in
Muhani, I'm going to try and get a

244
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
Muhani, I'm going to try and get a
 

245
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,710
Muhani, I'm going to try and get a
secondary awas, right? Or a secondary

246
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
secondary awas, right? Or a secondary
 

247
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,070
secondary awas, right? Or a secondary
position, right? And that's going to

248
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
position, right? And that's going to
 

249
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,229
position, right? And that's going to
come through our tino, right? So imagine

250
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
come through our tino, right? So imagine
 

251
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,190
come through our tino, right? So imagine
we right now we're going to put his

252
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
we right now we're going to put his
 

253
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,470
we right now we're going to put his
hands out really simply right out in

254
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
hands out really simply right out in
 

255
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,070
hands out really simply right out in
front of him. I'm going to try to get a

256
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
front of him. I'm going to try to get a
 

257
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,110
front of him. I'm going to try to get a
stoi, which puts me in hitoi, right? I'm

258
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
stoi, which puts me in hitoi, right? I'm
 

259
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,030
stoi, which puts me in hitoi, right? I'm
going to try to get an edi which puts me

260
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
going to try to get an edi which puts me
 

261
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,190
going to try to get an edi which puts me
in eimi. Right. I'm going to try to get

262
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
in eimi. Right. I'm going to try to get
 

263
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,630
in eimi. Right. I'm going to try to get
any one of those tiny hinka we talk

264
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
any one of those tiny hinka we talk
 

265
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,949
any one of those tiny hinka we talk
about all the time. 45s 90s triangles

266
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
about all the time. 45s 90s triangles
 

267
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,469
about all the time. 45s 90s triangles
all that stuff. Okay. Now, as I do that,

268
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
all that stuff. Okay. Now, as I do that,
 

269
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,830
all that stuff. Okay. Now, as I do that,
if he can, he's going to adapt to that

270
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
if he can, he's going to adapt to that
 

271
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,990
if he can, he's going to adapt to that
in some way. Now, there's really only

272
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
in some way. Now, there's really only
 

273
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,189
in some way. Now, there's really only
three ways he's going to adapt. So,

274
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
three ways he's going to adapt. So,
 

275
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,550
three ways he's going to adapt. So,
understand because we have suppression

276
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
understand because we have suppression
 

277
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,310
understand because we have suppression
here. I have his arm suppressed. He can

278
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
here. I have his arm suppressed. He can
 

279
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,350
here. I have his arm suppressed. He can
really only go over my

280
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,360
really only go over my
 

281
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,189
really only go over my
suppression, under my suppression, or

282
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
suppression, under my suppression, or
 

283
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,350
suppression, under my suppression, or
pull his hand back. Right? So, that's

284
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
pull his hand back. Right? So, that's
 

285
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,870
pull his hand back. Right? So, that's
basically how he's going to deal with my

286
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
basically how he's going to deal with my
 

287
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,110
basically how he's going to deal with my
suppression somehow. He actually can't

288
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
suppression somehow. He actually can't
 

289
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,870
suppression somehow. He actually can't
as long as I have a nice light body,

290
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
as long as I have a nice light body,
 

291
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,150
as long as I have a nice light body,
push into my suppression because if he

292
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
push into my suppression because if he
 

293
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,430
push into my suppression because if he
does that, I just move my body, right?

294
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
does that, I just move my body, right?
 

295
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,870
does that, I just move my body, right?
And I stay suppressed the whole time or

296
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
And I stay suppressed the whole time or
 

297
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,310
And I stay suppressed the whole time or
he stays suppressed the whole time as

298
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
he stays suppressed the whole time as
 

299
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,749
he stays suppressed the whole time as
I'm moving with him, right? So, he's

300
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
I'm moving with him, right? So, he's
 

301
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,030
I'm moving with him, right? So, he's
going to have to do one of those three

302
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
going to have to do one of those three
 

303
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,909
going to have to do one of those three
things. Now, I predicts to us that if he

304
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
things. Now, I predicts to us that if he
 

305
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,510
things. Now, I predicts to us that if he
goes up, I should try and stay stuck and

306
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
goes up, I should try and stay stuck and
 

307
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,230
goes up, I should try and stay stuck and
I get echo with it, right? So, Eko comes

308
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
I get echo with it, right? So, Eko comes
 

309
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,830
I get echo with it, right? So, Eko comes
out really naturally if he goes up.

310
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
out really naturally if he goes up.
 

311
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,150
out really naturally if he goes up.
Okay? If he pulls his hand back, I

312
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
Okay? If he pulls his hand back, I
 

313
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,150
Okay? If he pulls his hand back, I
should try and stay stuck to his hand,

314
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
should try and stay stuck to his hand,
 

315
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,909
should try and stay stuck to his hand,
right? So that takes care of itself in

316
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
right? So that takes care of itself in
 

317
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,230
right? So that takes care of itself in
its own way. Now, if he goes around, we

318
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
its own way. Now, if he goes around, we
 

319
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,990
its own way. Now, if he goes around, we
start to have a lot of difficulty.

320
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
start to have a lot of difficulty.
 

321
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,430
start to have a lot of difficulty.
That's going to be the easiest and best

322
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
That's going to be the easiest and best
 

323
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,990
That's going to be the easiest and best
way for him to re-engage with me is just

324
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
way for him to re-engage with me is just
 

325
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,590
way for him to re-engage with me is just
to bring his arm down and around like

326
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
to bring his arm down and around like
 

327
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,710
to bring his arm down and around like
that. And that's what he's looking for.

328
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
that. And that's what he's looking for.
 

329
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,230
that. And that's what he's looking for.
Okay. Now, if he gets me there, I'm in a

330
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
Okay. Now, if he gets me there, I'm in a
 

331
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,710
Okay. Now, if he gets me there, I'm in a
really bad way. So, anytime I'm in that

332
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
really bad way. So, anytime I'm in that
 

333
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,430
really bad way. So, anytime I'm in that
position, I should either try to uh

334
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
position, I should either try to uh
 

335
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,189
position, I should either try to uh
shoot through and we'll count that just

336
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
shoot through and we'll count that just
 

337
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,270
shoot through and we'll count that just
as one of our secondary or a tiny hinko

338
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
as one of our secondary or a tiny hinko
 

339
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,629
as one of our secondary or a tiny hinko
to get to our secondary positions,

340
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
to get to our secondary positions,
 

341
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,270
to get to our secondary positions,
right? Or I have to shoot a triangle

342
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
right? Or I have to shoot a triangle
 

343
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,629
right? Or I have to shoot a triangle
because he's come around. I can't get

344
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
because he's come around. I can't get
 

345
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,590
because he's come around. I can't get
underneath. Boom. I'm going to have him

346
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
underneath. Boom. I'm going to have him
 

347
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,029
underneath. Boom. I'm going to have him
go like this. Okay. So, actually, let's

348
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
go like this. Okay. So, actually, let's
 

349
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,790
go like this. Okay. So, actually, let's
shoot to the other side. So, so we're

350
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
shoot to the other side. So, so we're
 

351
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,270
shoot to the other side. So, so we're
here as he goes around underneath. Yep.

352
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
here as he goes around underneath. Yep.
 

353
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,629
here as he goes around underneath. Yep.
Boom. There. And I pop out to this

354
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
Boom. There. And I pop out to this
 

355
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,909
Boom. There. And I pop out to this
position right here. So, now I'm in a

356
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
position right here. So, now I'm in a
 

357
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,350
position right here. So, now I'm in a
nice triangle position. Let's angle you

358
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
nice triangle position. Let's angle you
 

359
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,510
nice triangle position. Let's angle you
this a little bit. Okay. So, now we're

360
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
this a little bit. Okay. So, now we're
 

361
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,590
this a little bit. Okay. So, now we're
into all of our tertiary position. So,

362
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
into all of our tertiary position. So,
 

363
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,510
into all of our tertiary position. So,
this is our third positions that will

364
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
this is our third positions that will
 

365
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,749
this is our third positions that will
lead to technique. So, this inside

366
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
lead to technique. So, this inside
 

367
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,749
lead to technique. So, this inside
position is like the third and final

368
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
position is like the third and final
 

369
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,430
position is like the third and final
kind of variation on this. His arms are

370
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
kind of variation on this. His arms are
 

371
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,710
kind of variation on this. His arms are
wide. He's coming to get me. I have my

372
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
wide. He's coming to get me. I have my
 

373
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,070
wide. He's coming to get me. I have my
hand in his face and I'm trying to deal

374
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
hand in his face and I'm trying to deal
 

375
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,510
hand in his face and I'm trying to deal
with this. So, what's he going to do

376
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
with this. So, what's he going to do
 

377
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,749
with this. So, what's he going to do
from this? Well, he could just keep

378
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
from this? Well, he could just keep
 

379
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,670
from this? Well, he could just keep
trying to charge in and get me. Bang.

380
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
trying to charge in and get me. Bang.
 

381
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,749
trying to charge in and get me. Bang.
Just like this. Okay. Now, that really

382
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
Just like this. Okay. Now, that really
 

383
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,510
Just like this. Okay. Now, that really
directly leads to a

384
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:04,520
directly leads to a
 

385
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,590
directly leads to a
koshag, right? So, we get a kosh. Okay.

386
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
koshag, right? So, we get a kosh. Okay.
 

387
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,950
koshag, right? So, we get a kosh. Okay.
Mic problem. No problem. But Josh

388
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
Mic problem. No problem. But Josh
 

389
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,629
Mic problem. No problem. But Josh
grabbed my lapel mic. No problem. Okay.

390
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
grabbed my lapel mic. No problem. Okay.
 

391
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,870
grabbed my lapel mic. No problem. Okay.
So, that leads directly to a koshi nag,

392
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
So, that leads directly to a koshi nag,
 

393
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,830
So, that leads directly to a koshi nag,
right? Okay. If he keeps coming and

394
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
right? Okay. If he keeps coming and
 

395
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,990
right? Okay. If he keeps coming and
trying to go around this, this leads to

396
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
trying to go around this, this leads to
 

397
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,070
trying to go around this, this leads to
kiteen. And if he goes underneath, we

398
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
kiteen. And if he goes underneath, we
 

399
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,230
kiteen. And if he goes underneath, we
get a classic kite nag. But it's just

400
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
get a classic kite nag. But it's just
 

401
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,550
get a classic kite nag. But it's just
the concept of kiteen. And I think

402
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
the concept of kiteen. And I think
 

403
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,150
the concept of kiteen. And I think
that's an important distinction is to

404
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
that's an important distinction is to
 

405
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,150
that's an important distinction is to
not think about the kiten as being like

406
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
not think about the kiten as being like
 

407
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,070
not think about the kiten as being like
kiteen nag. Although if he goes lower

408
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
kiteen nag. Although if he goes lower
 

409
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,189
kiteen nag. Although if he goes lower
and lower lower trying to get around my

410
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
and lower lower trying to get around my
 

411
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,629
and lower lower trying to get around my
suppression. Why I'm saying that is like

412
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
suppression. Why I'm saying that is like
 

413
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,990
suppression. Why I'm saying that is like
so I have my hand in his face. Where's

414
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
so I have my hand in his face. Where's
 

415
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,510
so I have my hand in his face. Where's
he going to put his head if he wants to

416
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
he going to put his head if he wants to
 

417
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,350
he going to put his head if he wants to
get to me? Watch. See he dropped his

418
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
get to me? Watch. See he dropped his
 

419
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,430
get to me? Watch. See he dropped his
head, right? So if he drops his head and

420
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
head, right? So if he drops his head and
 

421
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,950
head, right? So if he drops his head and
I drop my hand and he drops his head and

422
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
I drop my hand and he drops his head and
 

423
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,309
I drop my hand and he drops his head and
I drop my hand, he drops his head and I

424
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
I drop my hand, he drops his head and I
 

425
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,469
I drop my hand, he drops his head and I
drop my hand. We get kitanag. Not cuz I

426
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
drop my hand. We get kitanag. Not cuz I
 

427
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,670
drop my hand. We get kitanag. Not cuz I
push his head down but because he's

428
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
push his head down but because he's
 

429
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,350
push his head down but because he's
trying to slip his head down underneath

430
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
trying to slip his head down underneath
 

431
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,270
trying to slip his head down underneath
and around me, right? So that's what

432
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
and around me, right? So that's what
 

433
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,150
and around me, right? So that's what
he's up to. So that will often lead to a

434
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
he's up to. So that will often lead to a
 

435
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,350
he's up to. So that will often lead to a
kitanag like that. But just the kite is

436
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
kitanag like that. But just the kite is
 

437
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,110
kitanag like that. But just the kite is
how I'm dealing with that tertiary

438
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
how I'm dealing with that tertiary
 

439
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,270
how I'm dealing with that tertiary
position. Right? So I'm here. When Josh

440
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
position. Right? So I'm here. When Josh
 

441
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,110
position. Right? So I'm here. When Josh
comes in towards me, this is just how

442
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
comes in towards me, this is just how
 

443
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,710
comes in towards me, this is just how
I'm dealing with it. Right? That is just

444
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm dealing with it. Right? That is just
 

445
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,390
I'm dealing with it. Right? That is just
that that turning around action is just

446
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
that that turning around action is just
 

447
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,510
that that turning around action is just
how I'm dealing with it. Now, if he

448
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
how I'm dealing with it. Now, if he
 

449
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,110
how I'm dealing with it. Now, if he
doesn't want to just spin with me, he's

450
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
doesn't want to just spin with me, he's
 

451
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,309
doesn't want to just spin with me, he's
going to engage and that will probably

452
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
going to engage and that will probably
 

453
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,469
going to engage and that will probably
lead to a kitenag. But that's what that

454
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
lead to a kitenag. But that's what that
 

455
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,270
lead to a kitenag. But that's what that
kiten position is, right? Okay. Other

456
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
kiten position is, right? Okay. Other
 

457
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,629
kiten position is, right? Okay. Other
than that, what am I going to do? Well,

458
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
than that, what am I going to do? Well,
 

459
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,230
than that, what am I going to do? Well,
I'm going to get this arm down somehow

460
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm going to get this arm down somehow
 

461
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,510
I'm going to get this arm down somehow
so I can start to come through, right?

462
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
so I can start to come through, right?
 

463
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,189
so I can start to come through, right?
And so this is gate on barai, that low

464
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
And so this is gate on barai, that low
 

465
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,790
And so this is gate on barai, that low
sweep like that. And then that could

466
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
sweep like that. And then that could
 

467
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,270
sweep like that. And then that could
become this kind of blend. it could turn

468
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
become this kind of blend. it could turn
 

469
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,110
become this kind of blend. it could turn
into a silt moari and we get all the

470
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
into a silt moari and we get all the
 

471
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
into a silt moari and we get all the
other techniques from that right so

472
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
other techniques from that right so
 

473
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,029
other techniques from that right so
these the techniques naturally arise

474
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
these the techniques naturally arise
 

475
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,950
these the techniques naturally arise
because he keeps giving me a problem

476
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
because he keeps giving me a problem
 

477
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,870
because he keeps giving me a problem
with what I initially want to do right

478
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
with what I initially want to do right
 

479
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,510
with what I initially want to do right
so think of it it's real simple I want

480
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
so think of it it's real simple I want
 

481
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,110
so think of it it's real simple I want
to not be in front of him so I'm going

482
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
to not be in front of him so I'm going
 

483
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,870
to not be in front of him so I'm going
to move somewhere now if he let me move

484
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
to move somewhere now if he let me move
 

485
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,909
to move somewhere now if he let me move
somewhere and didn't do anything and

486
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
somewhere and didn't do anything and
 

487
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,469
somewhere and didn't do anything and
Josh kept coming forward he would miss

488
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
Josh kept coming forward he would miss
 

489
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,469
Josh kept coming forward he would miss
me and that would be fantastic right now

490
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
me and that would be fantastic right now
 

491
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,830
me and that would be fantastic right now
we know that's almost certainly not

492
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
we know that's almost certainly not
 

493
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,390
we know that's almost certainly not
going to happen so from my primary

494
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
going to happen so from my primary
 

495
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,390
going to happen so from my primary
position attempt he's going to adjust

496
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
position attempt he's going to adjust
 

497
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,670
position attempt he's going to adjust
right and he's going to keep doing that

498
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
right and he's going to keep doing that
 

499
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,629
right and he's going to keep doing that
I'm going to go to a prim primary

500
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
I'm going to go to a prim primary
 

501
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,510
I'm going to go to a prim primary
position. He's going to adjust. I'm

502
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
position. He's going to adjust. I'm
 

503
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,550
position. He's going to adjust. I'm
going to go to a primary position. He's

504
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
going to go to a primary position. He's
 

505
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,749
going to go to a primary position. He's
going to adjust. So that's our beginning

506
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
going to adjust. So that's our beginning
 

507
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,670
going to adjust. So that's our beginning
aas. That's going to get all the way

508
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
aas. That's going to get all the way
 

509
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,150
aas. That's going to get all the way
down very likely to we're in this inside

510
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
down very likely to we're in this inside
 

511
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,830
down very likely to we're in this inside
position and I'm starting to blend with

512
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
position and I'm starting to blend with
 

513
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,749
position and I'm starting to blend with
him. So I actually have to get full aas

514
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
him. So I actually have to get full aas
 

515
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,110
him. So I actually have to get full aas
here with suppression and I'm going to

516
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
here with suppression and I'm going to
 

517
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,629
here with suppression and I'm going to
make some kind of blend like this. Now

518
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
make some kind of blend like this. Now
 

519
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,550
make some kind of blend like this. Now
if I can make that blend successfully,

520
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
if I can make that blend successfully,
 

521
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,909
if I can make that blend successfully,
he'll blow by me again. So he's coming

522
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
he'll blow by me again. So he's coming
 

523
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,510
he'll blow by me again. So he's coming
in and I go like this. Boom. And I made

524
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
in and I go like this. Boom. And I made
 

525
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,589
in and I go like this. Boom. And I made
a successful sto. Bang. And he flies off

526
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
a successful sto. Bang. And he flies off
 

527
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,309
a successful sto. Bang. And he flies off
and that's fantastic. Okay. So all of

528
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
and that's fantastic. Okay. So all of
 

529
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,390
and that's fantastic. Okay. So all of
those setups are how the techniques

530
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
those setups are how the techniques
 

531
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,510
those setups are how the techniques
naturally arise. So, we have our primary

532
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
naturally arise. So, we have our primary
 

533
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,589
naturally arise. So, we have our primary
positions. He's always going to be

534
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
positions. He's always going to be
 

535
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,589
positions. He's always going to be
wanting to put me in a muhan me and I'm

536
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
wanting to put me in a muhan me and I'm
 

537
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,110
wanting to put me in a muhan me and I'm
always going to try to work behind him

538
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
always going to try to work behind him
 

539
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,189
always going to try to work behind him
to get to Ihan me. So, if I could just

540
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
to get to Ihan me. So, if I could just
 

541
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,110
to get to Ihan me. So, if I could just
magically get my way, I would be back

542
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
magically get my way, I would be back
 

543
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,550
magically get my way, I would be back
there. If he could magically get his

544
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
there. If he could magically get his
 

545
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,310
there. If he could magically get his
way, I would never move from here. Now,

546
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
way, I would never move from here. Now,
 

547
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,110
way, I would never move from here. Now,
we're going to have some kind of

548
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
we're going to have some kind of
 

549
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,110
we're going to have some kind of
negotiation in between that, right? So,

550
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
negotiation in between that, right? So,
 

551
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,389
negotiation in between that, right? So,
as he comes to get me, I'm going to

552
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
as he comes to get me, I'm going to
 

553
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,909
as he comes to get me, I'm going to
change positions. He's going to adapt to

554
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
change positions. He's going to adapt to
 

555
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,509
change positions. He's going to adapt to
me. I'm going to change positions. He's

556
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
me. I'm going to change positions. He's
 

557
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,790
me. I'm going to change positions. He's
going to adapt to me. Right? And this is

558
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
going to adapt to me. Right? And this is
 

559
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,230
going to adapt to me. Right? And this is
how we would get basic movement

560
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
how we would get basic movement
 

561
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,990
how we would get basic movement
happening. So, I keep trying to get to

562
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
happening. So, I keep trying to get to
 

563
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,590
happening. So, I keep trying to get to
one of those primary better positions.

564
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
one of those primary better positions.
 

565
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,030
one of those primary better positions.
Josh keeps trying to erase that with

566
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
Josh keeps trying to erase that with
 

567
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,030
Josh keeps trying to erase that with
Muhani. Now, that's going to happen all

568
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
Muhani. Now, that's going to happen all
 

569
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,870
Muhani. Now, that's going to happen all
the way until we get right up next to

570
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
the way until we get right up next to
 

571
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,389
the way until we get right up next to
each other. And then I'm going to get my

572
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
each other. And then I'm going to get my
 

573
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,389
each other. And then I'm going to get my
my secondary positions, which are these

574
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
my secondary positions, which are these
 

575
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,550
my secondary positions, which are these
really strong like, you know, so this is

576
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
really strong like, you know, so this is
 

577
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,790
really strong like, you know, so this is
a really strong Hito and me, right? And

578
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
a really strong Hito and me, right? And
 

579
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,990
a really strong Hito and me, right? And
I'm going to get that off of my basic

580
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm going to get that off of my basic
 

581
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,230
I'm going to get that off of my basic
tino. So, I'm going to suppress this guy

582
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
tino. So, I'm going to suppress this guy
 

583
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,829
tino. So, I'm going to suppress this guy
and I'm going to move with him and I'm

584
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
and I'm going to move with him and I'm
 

585
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,509
and I'm going to move with him and I'm
going to get that. Now, if he couldn't

586
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
going to get that. Now, if he couldn't
 

587
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,590
going to get that. Now, if he couldn't
adjust to that blend, then he would just

588
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
adjust to that blend, then he would just
 

589
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,030
adjust to that blend, then he would just
fly by me. So, he's coming in, I go like

590
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
fly by me. So, he's coming in, I go like
 

591
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,389
fly by me. So, he's coming in, I go like
this. Boom. And he couldn't adjust. He

592
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
this. Boom. And he couldn't adjust. He
 

593
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,829
this. Boom. And he couldn't adjust. He
would just fly off of me and we'd be

594
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
would just fly off of me and we'd be
 

595
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,190
would just fly off of me and we'd be
back to the first game we were playing,

596
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
back to the first game we were playing,
 

597
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,269
back to the first game we were playing,
right? So primary positions are at that

598
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
right? So primary positions are at that
 

599
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,509
right? So primary positions are at that
extended range. Secondary positions are

600
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
extended range. Secondary positions are
 

601
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,670
extended range. Secondary positions are
in that up close range. Now if he can

602
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
in that up close range. Now if he can
 

603
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,389
in that up close range. Now if he can
adapt to my secondary position attempt,

604
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
adapt to my secondary position attempt,
 

605
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,670
adapt to my secondary position attempt,
then we're going to get the tertiary

606
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
then we're going to get the tertiary
 

607
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,110
then we're going to get the tertiary
position, which is pretty much going to

608
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
position, which is pretty much going to
 

609
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,350
position, which is pretty much going to
be an the worst one is this inside wide

610
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
be an the worst one is this inside wide
 

611
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,110
be an the worst one is this inside wide
arm position. Right? So if I try to go

612
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
arm position. Right? So if I try to go
 

613
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,389
arm position. Right? So if I try to go
to the outside and he shoots that arm

614
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
to the outside and he shoots that arm
 

615
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,829
to the outside and he shoots that arm
low, I'm going to go here. So I have a

616
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
low, I'm going to go here. So I have a
 

617
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,829
low, I'm going to go here. So I have a
triangle right now. Everything else that

618
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
triangle right now. Everything else that
 

619
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,430
triangle right now. Everything else that
happens, all the iikido techniques that

620
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
happens, all the iikido techniques that
 

621
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,630
happens, all the iikido techniques that
happen happen from that. Right? So it's

622
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
happen happen from that. Right? So it's
 

623
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,990
happen happen from that. Right? So it's
going to happen in some way coming off

624
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
going to happen in some way coming off
 

625
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,790
going to happen in some way coming off
of that setup. So, um, I hope this video

626
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
of that setup. So, um, I hope this video
 

627
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,790
of that setup. So, um, I hope this video
makes sense because the mic fell off a

628
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
makes sense because the mic fell off a
 

629
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,310
makes sense because the mic fell off a
couple times and and we had to restart.

630
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
couple times and and we had to restart.
 

631
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,310
couple times and and we had to restart.
But, so I hope that made sense to you

632
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
But, so I hope that made sense to you
 

633
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,590
But, so I hope that made sense to you
guys. If it didn't make sense, let me

634
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
guys. If it didn't make sense, let me
 

635
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,870
guys. If it didn't make sense, let me
know and I'll make a better video for

636
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
know and I'll make a better video for
 

637
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,230
know and I'll make a better video for
you explaining it. But you have to

638
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
you explaining it. But you have to
 

639
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,509
you explaining it. But you have to
understand that everything's always done

640
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
understand that everything's always done
 

641
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,110
understand that everything's always done
in a series of they're going to do

642
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
in a series of they're going to do
 

643
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,710
in a series of they're going to do
something. I'm going to try this.

644
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
something. I'm going to try this.
 

645
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,230
something. I'm going to try this.
They're going to adapt to me or not. If

646
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
They're going to adapt to me or not. If
 

647
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,750
They're going to adapt to me or not. If
they don't adapt to me, then cool. The

648
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
they don't adapt to me, then cool. The
 

649
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,750
they don't adapt to me, then cool. The
thing I tried worked. If not, then I

650
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
thing I tried worked. If not, then I
 

651
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,190
thing I tried worked. If not, then I
have to have new answers for them

652
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
have to have new answers for them
 

653
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,470
have to have new answers for them
adapting to me. And that's going to go

654
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
adapting to me. And that's going to go
 

655
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,389
adapting to me. And that's going to go
all the way on until one person gets

656
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
all the way on until one person gets
 

657
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,550
all the way on until one person gets
their way or we have a resolution of

658
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
their way or we have a resolution of
 

659
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,790
their way or we have a resolution of
some sort, right? So, uh, that's that

660
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
some sort, right? So, uh, that's that
 

661
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,069
some sort, right? So, uh, that's that
for that video. I'm Christopher Fine.

662
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
for that video. I'm Christopher Fine.
 

663
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,310
for that video. I'm Christopher Fine.
