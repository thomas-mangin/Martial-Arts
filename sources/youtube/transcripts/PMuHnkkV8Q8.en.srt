41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,750

doing when I add the spiral it kind of

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:14,760
doing when I add the spiral it kind of
 

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,910
doing when I add the spiral it kind of
looks like katat but it doesn't feel

okay what I'm doing is getting the
 

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,670
okay what I'm doing is getting the
ground to stabilize the

104
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
ground to stabilize the
 

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,550
ground to stabilize the

you get you hit that shoulder it comes
 

113
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,270
you get you hit that shoulder it comes
back and now and now you're up and

hold down like

122
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,199

 

123
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,270

there okay so
 

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,430
there okay so
you can't be static like we are here in

130
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:02,440
you can't be static like we are here in
 

131
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,909
you can't be static like we are here in

snapping that elbow and I can move

138
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,240

so I don't always have to get

148
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:34,039
so I don't always have to get
 

149
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,909
so I don't always have to get
him uh so the ground won let him keep

150
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
him uh so the ground won let him keep
 

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,790
him uh so the ground won let him keep
absorbing that you see how much the

152
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:39,800
absorbing that you see how much the
 

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,189
absorbing that you see how much the
ground is not being pinned won't let me

154
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
ground is not being pinned won't let me
 

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,990
ground is not being pinned won't let me
get the other

156
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,000
get the other
 

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,510
get the other
stabilizing energy on this side so he

158
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
stabilizing energy on this side so he
 

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,990
stabilizing energy on this side so he
just goes down with it but you can see

160
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
just goes down with it but you can see
 

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,309
just goes down with it but you can see
how he's right at my right knee my left

162
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
how he's right at my right knee my left
 

163
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,950
how he's right at my right knee my left
knee okay so here I'm doing the same

164
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:55,960
knee okay so here I'm doing the same
 

165
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,950
