1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,220

so yeah I know it's like it's kind of a

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,230
so yeah I know it's like it's kind of a
 

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,280
so yeah I know it's like it's kind of a
study in naturalness okay so my base I'm

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,290
study in naturalness okay so my base I'm
 

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,470
study in naturalness okay so my base I'm
just gonna play with my footwork okay

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:15,480
just gonna play with my footwork okay
 

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,370
just gonna play with my footwork okay
I'll bring my feet in there they're

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,380
I'll bring my feet in there they're
 

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,090
I'll bring my feet in there they're
inside my hips can you see that okay it

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,100
inside my hips can you see that okay it
 

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,120
inside my hips can you see that okay it
now requires me to hold my balance I

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,130
now requires me to hold my balance I
 

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,929
now requires me to hold my balance I
have to actually micro adjust to flexion

14
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:29,939
have to actually micro adjust to flexion
 

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,240
have to actually micro adjust to flexion
mic reflections in my lower legs and

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,250
mic reflections in my lower legs and
 

17
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,930
mic reflections in my lower legs and
things like that okay if I just come a

18
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,940
things like that okay if I just come a
 

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,979
things like that okay if I just come a
little bit to where my hip joints are

20
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:39,989
little bit to where my hip joints are
 

21
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,090
little bit to where my hip joints are
then the naturalness comes in where I

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
then the naturalness comes in where I
 

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,000
then the naturalness comes in where I
don't have to do anything and it's it's

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,010
don't have to do anything and it's it's
 

25
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,880
don't have to do anything and it's it's
holding itself to see that you can

26
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:49,890
holding itself to see that you can
 

27
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,580
holding itself to see that you can
understand naturalness says I'm not do

28
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:52,590
understand naturalness says I'm not do
 

29
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,660
understand naturalness says I'm not do
I'm not having to do anything okay if I

30
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:56,670
I'm not having to do anything okay if I
 

31
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,939
I'm not having to do anything okay if I
raised my heel in the back foot like

32
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:58,949
raised my heel in the back foot like
 

33
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,670
raised my heel in the back foot like
really high then you'll see if I don't

34
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
really high then you'll see if I don't
 

35
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,529
really high then you'll see if I don't
do anything what's gonna happen I'm

36
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:03,539
do anything what's gonna happen I'm
 

37
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,039
do anything what's gonna happen I'm
gonna fall to that she caught you okay

38
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:06,049
gonna fall to that she caught you okay
 

39
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,980
gonna fall to that she caught you okay
if I put my heel down on the ground

40
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:09,990
if I put my heel down on the ground
 

41
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,920
if I put my heel down on the ground
right and then you'll feel the flexion

42
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:12,930
right and then you'll feel the flexion
 

43
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,140
right and then you'll feel the flexion
in the hip and then the front of the

44
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,150
in the hip and then the front of the
 

45
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,230
in the hip and then the front of the
knee right and so I have to be flexible

46
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
knee right and so I have to be flexible
 

47
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,109
knee right and so I have to be flexible
in order to do that but if I have a kind

48
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
in order to do that but if I have a kind
 

49
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,510
in order to do that but if I have a kind
of I find that heel angle where I can

50
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
of I find that heel angle where I can
 

51
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,120
of I find that heel angle where I can
just rest of this posture do you

52
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,130
just rest of this posture do you
 

53
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,180
just rest of this posture do you
understand that

54
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,190
understand that
 

55
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,230
understand that
okay then safety goes with the draw and

56
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
okay then safety goes with the draw and
 

57
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,870
okay then safety goes with the draw and
there's a natural way where my arm will

58
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:39,880
there's a natural way where my arm will
 

59
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,650
there's a natural way where my arm will
move if I start changing anything so for

60
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:43,660
move if I start changing anything so for
 

61
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,450
move if I start changing anything so for
example I'm going I'm going to come with

62
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:48,460
example I'm going I'm going to come with
 

63
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,890
example I'm going I'm going to come with
the sword all the way on the other side

64
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:49,900
the sword all the way on the other side
 

65
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,340
the sword all the way on the other side
this you'll feel a tension here because

66
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,350
this you'll feel a tension here because
 

67
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,340
this you'll feel a tension here because
that's a far reach it's a far reach to

68
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,350
that's a far reach it's a far reach to
 

69
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,030
that's a far reach it's a far reach to
go you don't even have to embrace the

70
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
go you don't even have to embrace the
 

71
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,310
go you don't even have to embrace the
tactical considerations of exposing

72
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
tactical considerations of exposing
 

73
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,300
tactical considerations of exposing
yourself and you know now you have to

74
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,310
yourself and you know now you have to
 

75
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,920
yourself and you know now you have to
get back to the center line after you

76
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:07,930
get back to the center line after you
 

77
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,290
get back to the center line after you
crossed it you you'll feel that that

78
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:10,300
crossed it you you'll feel that that
 

79
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,390
crossed it you you'll feel that that
that doesn't feel easy there's a tension

80
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:15,400
that doesn't feel easy there's a tension
 

81
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,210
that doesn't feel easy there's a tension
right here when that happens and as you

82
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,220
right here when that happens and as you
 

83
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,060
right here when that happens and as you
as you start to go the tension starts to

84
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,070
as you start to go the tension starts to
 

85
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,320
as you start to go the tension starts to
spread from joint to joint it's now a

86
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,330
spread from joint to joint it's now a
 

87
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,250
spread from joint to joint it's now a
natural feeling I bring this back here

88
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,260
natural feeling I bring this back here
 

89
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,220
natural feeling I bring this back here
and then this movement is easy to do and

90
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,230
and then this movement is easy to do and
 

91
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,780
and then this movement is easy to do and
it doesn't require anything out of my

92
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:36,790
it doesn't require anything out of my
 

93
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,080
it doesn't require anything out of my
shoulder but am i trying to draw the

94
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,090
shoulder but am i trying to draw the
 

95
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,810
shoulder but am i trying to draw the
sword from here then you'll feel the

96
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:42,820
sword from here then you'll feel the
 

97
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,960
sword from here then you'll feel the
tension again so the movement on this

98
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:47,970
tension again so the movement on this
 

99
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,390
tension again so the movement on this
new casket is I'm going to come out and

100
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
new casket is I'm going to come out and
 

101
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,770
new casket is I'm going to come out and
when do you when do you start to raise

102
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:55,780
when do you when do you start to raise
 

103
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,680
when do you when do you start to raise
the sword right before you feel the

104
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,690
the sword right before you feel the
 

105
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,470
the sword right before you feel the
tension will feel the tension so you

106
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:01,480
tension will feel the tension so you
 

107
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,310
tension will feel the tension so you
start to change the cycle of action okay

108
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,320
start to change the cycle of action okay
 

109
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,040
start to change the cycle of action okay
and now the same thing here I'm tension

110
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,050
and now the same thing here I'm tension
 

111
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,330
and now the same thing here I'm tension
free but if I start to do more right

112
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,340
free but if I start to do more right
 

113
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,520
free but if I start to do more right
you're gonna feel the tension tension

114
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,530
you're gonna feel the tension tension
 

115
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,040
you're gonna feel the tension tension
here you can tension here again if I

116
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,050
here you can tension here again if I
 

117
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,680
here you can tension here again if I
change if I take the sword out of it and

118
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:19,690
change if I take the sword out of it and
 

119
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,320
change if I take the sword out of it and
when I lean like this do I get to do

120
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,330
when I lean like this do I get to do
 

121
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,840
when I lean like this do I get to do
nothing no I have to micro adjust a

122
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:24,850
nothing no I have to micro adjust a
 

123
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,640
nothing no I have to micro adjust a
device I'm going to fall forward like

124
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,650
device I'm going to fall forward like
 

125
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,420
device I'm going to fall forward like
that do you understand so keep the base

126
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:32,430
that do you understand so keep the base
 

127
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,900
that do you understand so keep the base
natural move the arms so that you don't

128
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:36,910
natural move the arms so that you don't
 

129
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,770
natural move the arms so that you don't
have to

130
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:37,780
have to
 

131
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,550
have to
lean to reach out alright so I can't

132
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:41,560
lean to reach out alright so I can't
 

133
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,430
lean to reach out alright so I can't
reach out because that's gonna make my

134
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,440
reach out because that's gonna make my
 

135
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,160
reach out because that's gonna make my
base unnatural so I go as far as I can

136
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,170
base unnatural so I go as far as I can
 

137
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,490
base unnatural so I go as far as I can
natural and then I do this okay

138
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,500

 

139
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,170

and you'll find that you can do this the

140
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,180
and you'll find that you can do this the
 

141
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,350
and you'll find that you can do this the
whole way through so out the sword is

142
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
whole way through so out the sword is
 

143
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,090
whole way through so out the sword is
off same thing if I go here if I go

144
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,100
off same thing if I go here if I go
 

145
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,000
off same thing if I go here if I go
above my shoulder you'll feel the

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,900
tension you'll feel like that's not
natural there's a lot of pressure my

150
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:12,910
natural there's a lot of pressure my
 

151
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,360
natural there's a lot of pressure my
thumb I have to hold that there if I go

152
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,370
