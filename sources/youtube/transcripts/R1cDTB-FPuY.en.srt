1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,270

okay so start with the midfoot and then

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
okay so start with the midfoot and then
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,470
okay so start with the midfoot and then
put balance

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480

 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,830

that's where your weight sets

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
that's where your weight sets
 

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,589
that's where your weight sets
your knees are going out

8
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
your knees are going out
 

9
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,510
your knees are going out
the body is expanding

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520

 

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,349

and then you add

12
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
and then you add
 

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,950
and then you add
the energy

14
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
the energy
 

15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,590
the energy
from the sword onto that vector

16
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
from the sword onto that vector
 

17
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,790
from the sword onto that vector
so if i have this this midfoot vector

18
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
so if i have this this midfoot vector
 

19
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,910
so if i have this this midfoot vector
and i keep my balance in that state i

20
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
and i keep my balance in that state i
 

21
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,870
and i keep my balance in that state i
add the sword you're gonna go forward

22
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
add the sword you're gonna go forward
 

23
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,069
add the sword you're gonna go forward
okay right

24
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
okay right
 

25
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,190
okay right
very good

26
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
very good
 

27
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,310
very good
as you add

28
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
as you add
 

29
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,590
as you add
energy to the front of your body so

30
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
energy to the front of your body so
 

31
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,030
energy to the front of your body so
this is one

32
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
this is one
 

33
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,709
this is one
balance point

34
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
balance point
 

35
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,389
balance point
and you're going to have to find a new

36
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
and you're going to have to find a new
 

37
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,270
and you're going to have to find a new
one

38
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
one
 

39
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,590
one
for the sword

40
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
for the sword
 

41
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,950
for the sword
so it's dynamic with projector and as

42
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
so it's dynamic with projector and as
 

43
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,470
so it's dynamic with projector and as
you bring this up

44
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
you bring this up
 

45
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,110
you bring this up
it's going to change because that energy

46
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
it's going to change because that energy
 

47
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,310
it's going to change because that energy
value is changing you see so if i stay

48
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
value is changing you see so if i stay
 

49
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,750
value is changing you see so if i stay
here

50
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
here
 

51
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,549
here
and i start to bring this sword up

52
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
and i start to bring this sword up
 

53
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,390
and i start to bring this sword up
it's getting longer as my arms are

54
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
it's getting longer as my arms are
 

55
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,469
it's getting longer as my arms are
getting longer do you see that and it's

56
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
getting longer do you see that and it's
 

57
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,429
getting longer do you see that and it's
going to pull me forward

58
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
going to pull me forward
 

59
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,510
going to pull me forward
you guys understand so you can't just

60
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
you guys understand so you can't just
 

61
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,030
you guys understand so you can't just
stand worrying about where you want to

62
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
stand worrying about where you want to
 

63
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,670
stand worrying about where you want to
stand the whole time

64
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
stand the whole time
 

65
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,910
stand the whole time
even though my body's not moving

66
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
even though my body's not moving
 

67
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,510
even though my body's not moving
because i've tasked myself with the

68
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
because i've tasked myself with the
 

69
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,109
because i've tasked myself with the
mid-foot vector

70
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
mid-foot vector
 

71
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,390
mid-foot vector
is quite dynamic

72
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400

 

73
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,390

as it moves up

74
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
as it moves up
 

75
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,550
as it moves up
with foot and foot and equipment foot

76
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
with foot and foot and equipment foot
 

77
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,870
with foot and foot and equipment foot
and putting the foot in the foot has to

78
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
and putting the foot in the foot has to
 

79
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,749
and putting the foot in the foot has to
stay

80
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
stay
 

81
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,149
stay
each one has to take so i have mid-foot

82
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
each one has to take so i have mid-foot
 

83
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,069
each one has to take so i have mid-foot
vector here

84
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
vector here
 

85
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,149
vector here
and as i leave it there

86
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
and as i leave it there
 

87
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,469
and as i leave it there
and this thing starts to come back

88
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
and this thing starts to come back
 

89
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,990
and this thing starts to come back
it's going to

90
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
it's going to
 

91
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,069
it's going to
start to bring me back

92
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
start to bring me back
 

93
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,389
start to bring me back
okay

94
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399

 

95
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,190

so you're staying here not realizing

96
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
so you're staying here not realizing
 

97
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,550
so you're staying here not realizing
that your body's going backwards

98
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
that your body's going backwards
 

99
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,709
that your body's going backwards
because the energy value of the sword is

100
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
because the energy value of the sword is
 

101
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,830
because the energy value of the sword is
moving as it goes through itself

102
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
moving as it goes through itself
 

103
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,310
moving as it goes through itself
so

104
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320

 

105
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:22,470

pushing it forward

106
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480

 

107
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,790

i'll see your breath lie today

108
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
i'll see your breath lie today
 

109
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,589
i'll see your breath lie today
so

110
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
so
 

111
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,309
so
here i have my foot back vector and i

112
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
here i have my foot back vector and i
 

113
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,670
here i have my foot back vector and i
inhale

114
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680

 

115
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,430

and it changes it too okay

116
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
and it changes it too okay
 

117
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,030
and it changes it too okay
see if you're seeing your weight go toes

118
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
see if you're seeing your weight go toes
 

119
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,070
see if you're seeing your weight go toes
heels toes heels that's because you're

120
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
heels toes heels that's because you're
 

121
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,550
heels toes heels that's because you're
not adapting for every those ever

122
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
not adapting for every those ever
 

123
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,869
not adapting for every those ever
changing energy values okay

124
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
changing energy values okay
 

125
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,229
changing energy values okay
so

126
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
so
 

127
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,630
so
it's one thing to do up and down when

128
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
it's one thing to do up and down when
 

129
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,869
it's one thing to do up and down when
you're keeping the same energy value but

130
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
you're keeping the same energy value but
 

131
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,110
you're keeping the same energy value but
for what your breath is adding

132
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
for what your breath is adding
 

133
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,030
for what your breath is adding
and if you hold your breath which is not

134
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
and if you hold your breath which is not
 

135
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,470
and if you hold your breath which is not
uncommon

136
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
uncommon
 

137
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,229
uncommon
you're gonna do it

138
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
you're gonna do it
 

139
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,030
you're gonna do it
but it's quite dynamic

140
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
but it's quite dynamic
 

141
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,910
but it's quite dynamic
so let that mid-foot vector cover

142
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920

 

143
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,790

okay

144
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
okay
 

145
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,390
okay
slow down the sword like that so it

146
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
slow down the sword like that so it
 

147
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,270
slow down the sword like that so it
gives you time to adjust

148
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280

 

149
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,470

okay

150
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
okay
 

151
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,630
okay
so the first thing you want to get is

152
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
so the first thing you want to get is
 

153
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,550
so the first thing you want to get is
that mid-foot vector

154
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
that mid-foot vector
 

155
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,470
that mid-foot vector
all energies

156
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
all energies
 

157
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,830
all energies
all mass has energy got all energy

158
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
all mass has energy got all energy
 

159
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,229
all mass has energy got all energy
all movement movement has energy all

160
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
all movement movement has energy all
 

161
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,470
all movement movement has energy all
energy goes into that mid foot into the

162
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
energy goes into that mid foot into the
 

163
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,869
energy goes into that mid foot into the
ground

164
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879

 

165
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,789

but you're not just standing i can stand

166
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
but you're not just standing i can stand
 

167
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,030
but you're not just standing i can stand
on that mid foot like this you see with

168
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
on that mid foot like this you see with
 

169
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,509
on that mid foot like this you see with
my legs extended stuff

170
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
my legs extended stuff
 

171
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,070
my legs extended stuff
we're going to use that line

172
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
we're going to use that line
 

173
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,229
we're going to use that line
energetically but actually we're going

174
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
energetically but actually we're going
 

175
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,270
energetically but actually we're going
to use the energy of the ground

176
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280

uh
legs it's not a quadricep exercise you

204
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
legs it's not a quadricep exercise you
 

205
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,950
legs it's not a quadricep exercise you
would do lifts for that okay

206

would do lifts for that okay
 

207
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,909

i'm going to do different things
 

263
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,310
i'm going to do different things
and he's going to do this i can

264
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
and he's going to do this i can
 

265
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,390
and he's going to do this i can
he will not be able to

266

he will not be able to
 

267
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,950
he will not be able to
brace him to the ground ok

268
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
brace him to the ground ok
 

269
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,070
brace him to the ground ok
but if you get the other posture and you

270
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
but if you get the other posture and you
 

271
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,870
but if you get the other posture and you
can push and go ahead and you just push

272
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
can push and go ahead and you just push
 

273
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,469
can push and go ahead and you just push
it into the ground

274
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
it into the ground
 

275
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,510
it into the ground
okay normally you would go where's my

276
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
okay normally you would go where's my
 

277
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,309
okay normally you would go where's my
uh

278
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
uh
 

279
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,070
uh
bracing angle you don't you don't need

280
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
bracing angle you don't you don't need
 

281
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,870
bracing angle you don't you don't need
the bracing angle because he's just

282
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
the bracing angle because he's just
 

283
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,110
the bracing angle because he's just
pushing all that energy that's going

284
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
pushing all that energy that's going
 

285
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,189
pushing all that energy that's going
down okay so

286
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
down okay so
 

287
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,950
down okay so
no like that

297
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,950
flat
and that's going to require your pelvis

298
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
and that's going to require your pelvis
 

299
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,110
and that's going to require your pelvis
to go the opposite way

300
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
to go the opposite way
 

301
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,909
to go the opposite way
then

302
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919

the external external part okay
uh the internal part that's the harm

326
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
uh the internal part that's the harm
 

327
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,749
uh the internal part that's the harm
part right i'm gonna use that to get

328
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
part right i'm gonna use that to get
 

329
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,629
part right i'm gonna use that to get
this okay

as i move it upward
 

339
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,589
as i move it upward
there's the gravitational energy

340
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
there's the gravitational energy
 

341
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,550
there's the gravitational energy
it doesn't want to go you know that's

342
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560

 

343
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,790

that energy

344
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
that energy
 

345
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,350
that energy
that gravitational energy

346
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
that gravitational energy
 

347
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,710
that gravitational energy
i send

348
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
i send
 

349
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,430
i send
down in through my body down onto that

350
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
down in through my body down onto that
 

351
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,029
down in through my body down onto that
ground vector okay it's no different

352
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039

than his

354
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:34,840

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
transversing energy that's coming this
 

357
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,070
transversing energy that's coming this
way it goes into the ground and that's

358
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
way it goes into the ground and that's
 

359
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,309
way it goes into the ground and that's
what goes back out to him

360
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
what goes back out to him
 

361
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,309
what goes back out to him
he goes oh

362
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
he goes oh
 

363
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,550
he goes oh
same thing i'm just using gravity now

364
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
same thing i'm just using gravity now
 

365
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,150
same thing i'm just using gravity now
okay

366
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160

 

367
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,510

so

368
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
so
 

369
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,510
so
i'm going to take that energy home goes

370
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
i'm going to take that energy home goes
 

371
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,589
i'm going to take that energy home goes
into the

372
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599

up
 

375
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,029
up
so there's a kind of

376
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
so there's a kind of
 

377
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,230
so there's a kind of

and when i go back down

384
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
and when i go back down
 

385
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,469
and when i go back down
you're gonna see

386
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
you're gonna see
 

387
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,629
you're gonna see
there's an accelerating of that energy

388
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
there's an accelerating of that energy
 

389
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,589
there's an accelerating of that energy
or a communing with the gravitational

and now my external is going to be
 

395
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,589
and now my external is going to be
that

396
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
that
 

397
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:31,070
that

398
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080

401
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,630

there's the ip4 and the cube okay so i'm

402
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
there's the ip4 and the cube okay so i'm

there's the ip4 and the cube okay so i'm
just doing it with the sword

405
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,110

that means

406
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
that means
 

407
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,269
that means
that my four corners are going to remain

408
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
that my four corners are going to remain
 

409

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,750
in place
and my center is going to remain

412
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
and my center is going to remain
 

413
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,470
and my center is going to remain
pressurized okay i can't do it like this

pressurized okay i can't do it like this
 

415
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,750

you see how

416
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760

 

417
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,550

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
feel that that goes in through your body

you see this

498
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
you see this
 

499
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,310
you see this
that's the head of the ground vector and

500
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
that's the head of the ground vector and
 

501
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,790
that's the head of the ground vector and
when he pulls i'm not going to be able

502
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
when he pulls i'm not going to be able
 

503

00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
let's let's say you could still work for
 

709
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,150
let's let's say you could still work for
a second uh

710
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
a second uh
 

711
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,189
a second uh
the guy's sword is coming down on this

712
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
the guy's sword is coming down on this
 

713
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,590
the guy's sword is coming down on this
spine this vector

714
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600

 

715
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,909

it's coming down right here

716
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
it's coming down right here
 

717
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,829
it's coming down right here
i'm still on the line

718
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
i'm still on the line
 

719
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,309
i'm still on the line
we're still on the line

720
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
we're still on the line
 

721
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,510
we're still on the line
i actually stayed on the line or i go

722
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
i actually stayed on the line or i go
 

723
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,630
i actually stayed on the line or i go
one i'm still on the line you see

724
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
one i'm still on the line you see
 

725
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,549
one i'm still on the line you see
half of me still over here

726
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
half of me still over here
 

727
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,429
half of me still over here
and then

728
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
and then
 

729
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,510
and then
now i cut off

730
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
now i cut off
 

731
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,909
now i cut off
that requires a lot of time

732
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
that requires a lot of time
 

733
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,949
that requires a lot of time
time

734
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
time
 

735
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,110
time
makes it impractical it's no different

736
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
makes it impractical it's no different
 

737
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,190
makes it impractical it's no different
and he's throwing his jab and i'm

738
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
and he's throwing his jab and i'm
 

739
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,390
and he's throwing his jab and i'm
expecting these kind of clues

740
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
expecting these kind of clues
 

741
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,990
expecting these kind of clues
okay do you get it

742
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
okay do you get it
 

743
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,909
okay do you get it
uh this is enough

744
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
uh this is enough
 

745
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,230
uh this is enough
that's enough it goes fast

746
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
that's enough it goes fast
 

747
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,710
that's enough it goes fast
that's enough that's all i need so i'm

748
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
that's enough that's all i need so i'm
 

749
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,390
that's enough that's all i need so i'm
not asking for much

750
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
not asking for much
 

751
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,190
not asking for much
it makes it more practical okay

752
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200

 

753
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,430

so in this drill

754
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
so in this drill
 

755
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,789
so in this drill
you'll have that weapon you got to put

756
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
you'll have that weapon you got to put
 

757
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,549
you'll have that weapon you got to put
it really really close to you because

758
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
it really really close to you because
 

759
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,150
it really really close to you because
it's your spine that you're doing this

760
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
it's your spine that you're doing this
 

761
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,830
it's your spine that you're doing this
is trying to cut down your center line

762
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
is trying to cut down your center line
 

763
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,110
is trying to cut down your center line
right so your weight was on the front

764
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
right so your weight was on the front
 

765
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,029
right so your weight was on the front
it starts to move

766
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
it starts to move
 

767
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,110
it starts to move
around the weapon and you're on the

768
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
around the weapon and you're on the
 

769
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,510
around the weapon and you're on the
other side

770
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520

 

771
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,789

okay

772
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
okay
 

773
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,630
okay
let's try that bushido

774
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
let's try that bushido
 

775
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,510
let's try that bushido
go

776
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
go
 

777
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,470
go
okay

778
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480

 

779
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,310

start to turn

780
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
start to turn
 

781
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,909
start to turn
turn

782
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
turn
 

783
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,789
turn

turn
 

785
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,270
turn
everything

786
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
everything
 

787
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,909
everything
turn everything i'm picking up my foot

788
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
turn everything i'm picking up my foot
 

789
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,310
turn everything i'm picking up my foot
to let you know i'm not

790
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
to let you know i'm not
 

791
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,950
to let you know i'm not
pushing off that foot okay weight is

792
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
pushing off that foot okay weight is
 

793
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,110
pushing off that foot okay weight is
over here this foot is

794
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
over here this foot is
 

795
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,029
over here this foot is
not part of the turn that would be

796
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
not part of the turn that would be
 

797
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,110
not part of the turn that would be
double pivot and that would mean weight

798
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
double pivot and that would mean weight
 

799
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,990
double pivot and that would mean weight
was not all the way over here you get

800
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
was not all the way over here you get
 

801
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,230
was not all the way over here you get
that you can push off there you had some

802
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
that you can push off there you had some
 

803
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,630
that you can push off there you had some
weight on that foot okay and that would

804
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
weight on that foot okay and that would
 

805
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,950
weight on that foot okay and that would
mean you're still on the line of attack

806
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
mean you're still on the line of attack
 

807
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,830
mean you're still on the line of attack
okay

808
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
okay
 

809
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,789
okay
so all weight goes over and you turn

810
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
so all weight goes over and you turn
 

811
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,669
so all weight goes over and you turn
your body turn your body and this foot

812
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
your body turn your body and this foot
 

813
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,669
your body turn your body and this foot
now is free

814
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
now is free
 

815
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,549
now is free
to

816
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
to
 

817
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,230
to
just readjust

818
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
just readjust
 

819
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,590
just readjust
and gather a new angle of tap here

820
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
and gather a new angle of tap here
 

821
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,549
and gather a new angle of tap here
behind okay

822
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
behind okay
 

823
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,510
behind okay
it's not part of your deviation meaning

824
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
it's not part of your deviation meaning
 

825
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,270
it's not part of your deviation meaning
i'm still on the line

826
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
i'm still on the line
 

827
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,150
i'm still on the line
and then i deviated the deviation

828
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
and then i deviated the deviation
 

829
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,470
and then i deviated the deviation
already happened so

830
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
already happened so
 

831
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,590
already happened so
we'll adjust new angle over time all

832
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
we'll adjust new angle over time all
 

833
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:31,270
we'll adjust new angle over time all
weight is still on this foot okay

834
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280

 

835
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,390

you're getting

836
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400

okay punch make it

840
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120

 

841
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,669

real tight

842

863
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,549

shift uh it's very common

864
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
shift uh it's very common

very very common
 

869
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,990
very very common
that you shift here

870
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
that you shift here
 

871
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,149
that you shift here
and you you know it's true

872
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
and you you know it's true
 

873
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,789
and you you know it's true
this this turning on one foot is

874
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
this this turning on one foot is
 

875
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,830
this this turning on one foot is
difficult that's right now we're only

876
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
difficult that's right now we're only
 

877
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,430
difficult that's right now we're only
probably one of you is able to actually

878
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
probably one of you is able to actually
 

879
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,070
probably one of you is able to actually
move forward okay

880
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
move forward okay
 

881
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,789
move forward okay
so

882
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799

 

883
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,430

you're gonna step

884
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
you're gonna step
 

885
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,830
you're gonna step
and you have this

886
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
and you have this
 

887
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,190
and you have this
goofy thing

888
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
goofy thing
 

889
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,950
goofy thing
okay

890
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
okay
 

891
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,750
okay
this is biomechanically unsound

892
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
this is biomechanically unsound
 

893
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,510
this is biomechanically unsound
because my foot

894
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
because my foot
 

895
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,149
because my foot
is pulling on the tendons across my knee

896
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
is pulling on the tendons across my knee
 

897
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,470
is pulling on the tendons across my knee
here you see and now i'm out of

898
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
here you see and now i'm out of
 

899
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,110
here you see and now i'm out of
four corner alignment

900
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
four corner alignment
 

901
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,909
four corner alignment
my knee is not in alignment with my hip

902
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
my knee is not in alignment with my hip
 

903
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,630
my knee is not in alignment with my hip
it's outside you see

904
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
it's outside you see
 

905
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:09,590
it's outside you see
this is where i was supposed to be

906
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600

 

907
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,230

uh

908
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240

 

909
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,390

and then our master does it in our

910
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
and then our master does it in our
 

911
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,270
and then our master does it in our
master our master meaning our master

912
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
master our master meaning our master
 

913
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,350
master our master meaning our master
couldn't turn

914
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
couldn't turn
 

915
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,230
couldn't turn
okay

916
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
okay
 

917
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,590
okay
and now this is what we started doing

918
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
and now this is what we started doing
 

919
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,430
and now this is what we started doing
when i was supposed to not be in this

920
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
when i was supposed to not be in this
 

921
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,909
when i was supposed to not be in this
way

922
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919

 

923
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,510

but in this way

924
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
but in this way
 

925
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,430
but in this way
you see that difference

926
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
you see that difference
 

927
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,710
you see that difference
so if anything minimum this foot is

928
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
so if anything minimum this foot is
 

929
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,310
so if anything minimum this foot is
straight to the line of attack

930
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
straight to the line of attack
 

931
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,789
straight to the line of attack
if it was going to be at any angle it

932
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
if it was going to be at any angle it
 

933
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,270
if it was going to be at any angle it
would be it boom so you could drive that

934
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
would be it boom so you could drive that
 

935
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,510
would be it boom so you could drive that
hip in more you see that

936
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
hip in more you see that
 

937
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,270
hip in more you see that
it would not be here and i'm trying to

938
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,280
it would not be here and i'm trying to
 

939
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,270
it would not be here and i'm trying to
drive that hip in so you can't drive

940
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
drive that hip in so you can't drive
 

941
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,470
drive that hip in so you can't drive
that headpin so you're back here

942
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
that headpin so you're back here
 

943
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,590
that headpin so you're back here
okay

944
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
okay
 

945
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,029
okay
do you get that

946
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
do you get that
 

947
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,430
do you get that
so you can't

948
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
so you can't
 

949
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,510
so you can't
you can't break the laws of the internal

950
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
you can't break the laws of the internal
 

951
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,710
you can't break the laws of the internal
aspects

952
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
aspects
 

953
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,110
aspects
so that foot has to turn so that my knee

954
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
so that foot has to turn so that my knee
 

955
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,350
so that foot has to turn so that my knee
stays in alignment so that my hip stays

956
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
stays in alignment so that my hip stays
 

957
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,029
stays in alignment so that my hip stays
in alignment so that my shoulder stays

958
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
in alignment so that my shoulder stays
 

959
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,590
in alignment so that my shoulder stays
in alignment can't be going out you're

960
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
in alignment can't be going out you're
 

961
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,669
in alignment can't be going out you're
going to hurt yourself too

962
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
going to hurt yourself too
 

963
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,590
going to hurt yourself too
another common mistake

964
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
another common mistake
 

965
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,870
another common mistake
is if if i shifted my weight here

966
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
is if if i shifted my weight here
 

967
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,950
is if if i shifted my weight here
and i turned my weight i'm going to go

968
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
and i turned my weight i'm going to go
 

969
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,590
and i turned my weight i'm going to go
really slow so you can see and i turn my

970
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
really slow so you can see and i turn my
 

971
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,190
really slow so you can see and i turn my
weight you see

972
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
weight you see
 

973
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,029
weight you see
and i'm supposed to stay in the young

974
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
and i'm supposed to stay in the young
 

975
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,510
and i'm supposed to stay in the young
phase then my head should not travel

976
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
phase then my head should not travel
 

977
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,350
phase then my head should not travel
back you see that

978
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
back you see that
 

979
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,230
back you see that
so that that was that was the whole all

980
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
so that that was that was the whole all
 

981
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,029
so that that was that was the whole all
the deviation that i think said not here

982
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
the deviation that i think said not here
 

983
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,029
the deviation that i think said not here
if you find that your head is now

984
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
if you find that your head is now
 

985
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,029
if you find that your head is now
traveling back

986
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
traveling back
 

987
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,350
traveling back
you weren't staying in the young faces

988
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360

 

989
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,710

try to leave it

990
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
try to leave it
 

991
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,750
try to leave it
right on that foot okay try it again

992
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
right on that foot okay try it again
 

993
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,070
right on that foot okay try it again
okay so uh the

994
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
okay so uh the
 

995
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,230
okay so uh the
embryonic drill number one this is not

996
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
embryonic drill number one this is not
 

997
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,710
embryonic drill number one this is not
the technique because the timing is

998
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
the technique because the timing is
 

999
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,470
the technique because the timing is
totally different

1000
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
totally different
 

1001
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,669
totally different
in application okay so although he has a

1002
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
in application okay so although he has a
 

1003
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,190
in application okay so although he has a
sword in his hand it is not a cut

1004
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
sword in his hand it is not a cut
 

1005
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,830
sword in his hand it is not a cut
it's a

1006
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
it's a
 

1007
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,549
it's a
uh training vector i use his training

1008
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
uh training vector i use his training
 

1009
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,390
uh training vector i use his training
vector okay

1010
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
vector okay
 

1011
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,510
vector okay
so uh i'm going to start

1012
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
so uh i'm going to start
 

1013
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,590
so uh i'm going to start
in that position so

1014
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
in that position so
 

1015
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,789
in that position so
uh

1016
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
uh
 

1017
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,549
uh
how did i get there well i got there

1018
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
how did i get there well i got there
 

1019
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,870
how did i get there well i got there
when i took the step and i sucked that

1020
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
when i took the step and i sucked that
 

1021
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,830
when i took the step and i sucked that
foot in without changing anything

1022
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
foot in without changing anything
 

1023
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,310
foot in without changing anything
and i started up here okay

1024
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
and i started up here okay
 

1025
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,310
and i started up here okay
got it but we're just gonna start from

1026
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
got it but we're just gonna start from
 

1027
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,669
got it but we're just gonna start from
up there so

his sword
i'm going to shift my weight onto the

1046
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
i'm going to shift my weight onto the
 

1047
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,430
i'm going to shift my weight onto the
other foot and start the turn and you

1048
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
other foot and start the turn and you
 

1049
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,830
other foot and start the turn and you
see how i'm moving around that angle you

1050
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840

when he did his jab
well that was the yin yield

well that was the yin yield
 

1253
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,029
well that was the yin yield
do you see that

1254
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
do you see that
 

1255
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,230
do you see that
um

1256
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240

1289
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,669

uh if we go a little faster right

1290
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:51,679
uh if we go a little faster right
 

1291
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,909

of kimmy remains the same okay so he is
going to practice the technique

1394
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,640
going to practice the technique
 

1395
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,549
going to practice the technique
uh i'm very alive i'm very dynamic i'm a

1396
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:06,559
uh i'm very alive i'm very dynamic i'm a
 

1397
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,590
uh i'm very alive i'm very dynamic i'm a
vessel i'm ready to receive okay

1398
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
vessel i'm ready to receive okay
 

1399
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,230
vessel i'm ready to receive okay
i'm going to yin yield to this thing i'm

1400
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,240
i'm going to yin yield to this thing i'm
 

1401
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,149
i'm going to yin yield to this thing i'm
not going to run away from it and i'm

1402
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
not going to run away from it and i'm
 

1403
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,430
not going to run away from it and i'm
not gonna fight it okay so when we're

1404
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,440
not gonna fight it okay so when we're
 

1405
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,789
not gonna fight it okay so when we're
here

1406
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
here
 

1407
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,430
here
and he goes

1408
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
and he goes
 

1409
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,590
and he goes
i don't take it in my shoulders do you

1410
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
i don't take it in my shoulders do you
 

1411
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,190
i don't take it in my shoulders do you
see

1412
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,200
see
 

1413
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,310
see
he's attacking my center so my center

1414
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
he's attacking my center so my center
 

1415
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,990
he's attacking my center so my center
moves

1416
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
moves
 

1417
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,350
moves
okay

1418
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360

 

1419
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,870

he goes

1420
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880

 

1421
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,269

if you pay attention the angle of his

1422
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
if you pay attention the angle of his
 

1423
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,830
if you pay attention the angle of his
sword is displacing my sword to the

1424
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840
sword is displacing my sword to the
 

1425
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,269
sword is displacing my sword to the
right

1426
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
right
 

1427
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,230
right
so

1428
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
so
 

1429
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,789
so
i make sure my sword does not go to the

1430
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
i make sure my sword does not go to the
 

1431
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,669
i make sure my sword does not go to the
left

1432
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
left
 

1433
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,669
left
and i make sure that my sword does not

1434
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
and i make sure that my sword does not
 

1435
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,830
and i make sure that my sword does not
stay still

1436
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
stay still
 

1437
00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:00,870
stay still
i let him displace my sword

1438
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880

 

1439
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,789

you can go harder

1440
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:04,799

 

1441
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,430

then if we if i keep my sword there and

1442
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
then if we if i keep my sword there and
 

1443
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,590
then if we if i keep my sword there and
i stay in my shoulders he's going to hit

1444
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
i stay in my shoulders he's going to hit
 

1445
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,190
i stay in my shoulders he's going to hit
your arms

1446
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
your arms
 

1447
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,389
your arms
you see

1448
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
you see
 

1449
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,269
you see
but

1450
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
but
 

1451
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,149
but
if you yield with his downward pressure

1452
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
if you yield with his downward pressure
 

1453
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:16,950
if you yield with his downward pressure
sure

1454
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
sure
 

1455
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,029
sure
if i start to yield and i start to

1456
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
if i start to yield and i start to
 

1457
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,389
if i start to yield and i start to
displace

1458
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
displace
 

1459
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,269
displace
my arms went on the other side of his

1460
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
my arms went on the other side of his
 

1461
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:45,750
my arms went on the other side of his
okay

1462
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760

 

1463
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,870

okay

1464
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
okay
 

1465
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,350
okay
um let's do it again and stay at the

1466
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:49,360
um let's do it again and stay at the
 

1467
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,830
um let's do it again and stay at the
last

1468
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:50,840
last
 

1469
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,990
last
position right

1470
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
position right
 

1471
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,789
position right
harness

1472
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799

 

1473
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,070

stay there

1474
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
stay there
 

1475
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,750
stay there
and you can see

1476
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:57,760
and you can see
 

1477
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,269
and you can see
push down right let's do it again

1478
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:03,279

 

1479
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,509

his weight is on his hands

1480
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519

 

1481
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,470

and it's on the tip then

1482
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
and it's on the tip then
 

1483
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,030
and it's on the tip then
okay that's what you want to experience

1484
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
okay that's what you want to experience
 

1485
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:39,750
okay that's what you want to experience
all right here we go pay attention

1486
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:39,760

 

1487
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,629

okay so this is a common

1488
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
okay so this is a common
 

1489
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,710
okay so this is a common
uh error

1490
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
uh error
 

1491
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,349
uh error
and the common error is from the

1492
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359

 

1493
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,470

this is external

1494
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
this is external
 

1495
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,790
this is external
uh and in external applications go ahead

1496
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
uh and in external applications go ahead
 

1497
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,230
uh and in external applications go ahead
uh you have a lever

1498
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
uh you have a lever
 

1499
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,630
uh you have a lever
and then you have a

1500
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
and then you have a
 

1501
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,790
and then you have a
distillate

1502
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
distillate
 

1503
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,190
distillate
right and so who has the mechanical

1504
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
right and so who has the mechanical
 

1505
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,390
right and so who has the mechanical
advantage he does he does okay and as a

1506
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
advantage he does he does okay and as a
 

1507
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,790
advantage he does he does okay and as a
result you see your sword bounces off of

1508
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:14,800
result you see your sword bounces off of
 

1509
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,230
result you see your sword bounces off of
him it does not displace

1510
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,240
him it does not displace
 

1511
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,510
him it does not displace
immediately

1512
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
immediately
 

1513
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,950
immediately
you guys understand that so uh that has

1514
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
you guys understand that so uh that has
 

1515
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,630
you guys understand that so uh that has
to do with going back to this drill

1516
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,640
to do with going back to this drill
 

1517
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,190
to do with going back to this drill
first you got to find your ground vector

1518
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
first you got to find your ground vector
 

1519
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,510
first you got to find your ground vector
and then we moved on from there it's a

1520
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
and then we moved on from there it's a
 

1521
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,710
and then we moved on from there it's a
dynamic ground vector okay but i use

1522
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
dynamic ground vector okay but i use
 

1523
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,910
dynamic ground vector okay but i use
that all energy whatever movement matter

1524
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
that all energy whatever movement matter
 

1525
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,349
that all energy whatever movement matter
mass gravity all that goes down into the

1526
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
mass gravity all that goes down into the
 

1527
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,870
mass gravity all that goes down into the
earth and is what is rebounding either

1528
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
earth and is what is rebounding either
 

1529
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,990
earth and is what is rebounding either
in an uh energetic pathway towards my

1530
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000
in an uh energetic pathway towards my
 

1531
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,109
in an uh energetic pathway towards my
person or an energetic pathway away from

1532
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
person or an energetic pathway away from
 

1533
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,630
person or an energetic pathway away from
my person do you see that and um when

1534
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
my person do you see that and um when
 

1535
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,430
my person do you see that and um when
i'm coming down that all that energy

1536
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
i'm coming down that all that energy
 

1537
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,990
i'm coming down that all that energy
bouncing off the earth in an energetic

1538
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
bouncing off the earth in an energetic
 

1539
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,390
bouncing off the earth in an energetic
pattern away from my person and that we

1540
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
pattern away from my person and that we
 

1541
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,630
pattern away from my person and that we
don't have we just swing in the sword

1542
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
don't have we just swing in the sword
 

1543
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,589
don't have we just swing in the sword
okay

1544
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:05,599
okay
 

1545
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,829
okay

okay
 

1555
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,550
okay
we have to be able to displace it

1556
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,560
we have to be able to displace it
 

1557
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,430
we have to be able to displace it
um some other common

1558
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440
um some other common
 

1559
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,150
um some other common
errors

1560
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160

 

1561
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,150

is my sword is out of alignment

1562
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
is my sword is out of alignment
 

1563
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,950
is my sword is out of alignment

to keep contact you see so you end up
 

1597
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,109
to keep contact you see so you end up
down at the bottom

1598
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
down at the bottom
 

1599
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,990
down at the bottom
and you end up in something like this

1600

and you end up in something like this
 

1601
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,550

so pay attention to these very very very

1664
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:32,960
so pay attention to these very very very
 

1665
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,069
so pay attention to these very very very
very common mistakes out too far

1666
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
very common mistakes out too far
 

1667
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,750

head doing weird things
 

1671
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,310
head doing weird things
uh and then this

1672
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:42,320
uh and then this
 

1673
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,630
uh and then this
just your ishido tencon is not actually

1674

a new shield
 

1677
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,550
a new shield
okay

1678
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560

 

1679
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,550

okay so the question came up on uh

1680
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560
okay so the question came up on uh
 

1681
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,550
okay so the question came up on uh
the deviation

1682
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
the deviation
 

1683
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,510
the deviation
of moving that foot in do you see uh

1684
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
of moving that foot in do you see uh
 

1685
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,990
of moving that foot in do you see uh
because usually we're like i only know

1686
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,000
because usually we're like i only know
 

1687
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,750
because usually we're like i only know
come on

1688
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
come on
 

1689
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,230
come on
and then if you watch my head it moves a

1690
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,240
and then if you watch my head it moves a
 

1691
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,470
and then if you watch my head it moves a
lot through space do you see that

1692
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:10,480
lot through space do you see that
 

1693
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,510
lot through space do you see that
um

1694
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
um
 

1695
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,470
um
and then it's not marshalled because i'm

1696
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
and then it's not marshalled because i'm
 

1697
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,109
and then it's not marshalled because i'm
just running away from that guy okay as

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,790
people not trained far enough
use patterns okay and now you can use

1736
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800
use patterns okay and now you can use
 

1737
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,270
use patterns okay and now you can use
their patterns against them you see

1738
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
their patterns against them you see
 

1739
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,030
their patterns against them you see
um so

1740
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,040
um so
 

1741
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,870
um so
let's say he keeps doing one two and

1742
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:08,880
let's say he keeps doing one two and
 

1743
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,710
let's say he keeps doing one two and
then oh and he keeps doing oh he went

1744
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
then oh and he keeps doing oh he went
 

1745
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,589
then oh and he keeps doing oh he went
back

1746
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:11,599
back
 

1747
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,190
back
you see he went back after that one and

1748
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
you see he went back after that one and
 

1749
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,790
you see he went back after that one and
i started keying in on that kind of

1750
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
i started keying in on that kind of
 

1751
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,390
i started keying in on that kind of
stuff right uh so i'm here boom he goes

1752
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
stuff right uh so i'm here boom he goes
 

1753
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,589
stuff right uh so i'm here boom he goes
back

1754
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
back
 

1755
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,030
back
back you see

1756
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
back you see
 

1757
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,150
back you see
and he feels safe as he's doing it okay

1758
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
and he feels safe as he's doing it okay
 

1759
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,550
and he feels safe as he's doing it okay
and so what i'm going to do

1760
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
and so what i'm going to do
 

1761
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,430
and so what i'm going to do
is let him feel safe for a while

1762
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
is let him feel safe for a while
 

1763
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,710
is let him feel safe for a while
do you get it so we're going to slow it

1764
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
do you get it so we're going to slow it
 

1765
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,630
do you get it so we're going to slow it
down so you can see this and i want you

1766
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,640
down so you can see this and i want you
 

1767
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,270
down so you can see this and i want you
to pay attention when my back foot

1768
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
to pay attention when my back foot
 

1769
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,910
to pay attention when my back foot
changes the depth of my stance you see

1770
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:37,920
changes the depth of my stance you see
 

1771
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,069
changes the depth of my stance you see
that so at first

1772
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
that so at first
 

1773
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,829
that so at first
i bait him with this

1774
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839

 

1775
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,150

and then eventually

1776
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
and then eventually
 

1777
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,150
and then eventually
you see how that foot moves in

1778
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
you see how that foot moves in
 

1779
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,710
you see how that foot moves in
but to him when he's focusing up top he

1780
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
but to him when he's focusing up top he
 

1781
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,030
but to him when he's focusing up top he
doesn't see the back foot move in do you

1782
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
doesn't see the back foot move in do you
 

1783
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,069
doesn't see the back foot move in do you
see that so he's going

1784
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
see that so he's going
 

1785
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,150
see that so he's going
and i'm moving it in but my upper body

1786
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
and i'm moving it in but my upper body
 

1787
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,030
and i'm moving it in but my upper body
did not move at all you see that okay so

1788
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
did not move at all you see that okay so
 

1789
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,390
did not move at all you see that okay so
we go a little slow slower

1790
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400

 

1791
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,550

i can now penetrate that thing coming

1792
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
i can now penetrate that thing coming
 

1793
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,230
i can now penetrate that thing coming
back because that's not was not my

1794
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
back because that's not was not my
 

1795
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,470
back because that's not was not my
actual stance anymore but he thought it

1796
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480
actual stance anymore but he thought it
 

1797
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,510
actual stance anymore but he thought it
was my actual stance you see that um

1798
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
was my actual stance you see that um
 

1799
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,150
was my actual stance you see that um
that's very common you can do it too on

1800
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
that's very common you can do it too on
 

1801
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,390
that's very common you can do it too on
on and let's say he's way out there

1802
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
on and let's say he's way out there
 

1803
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,470
on and let's say he's way out there
right and i'm trying to throw some kicks

1804
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
right and i'm trying to throw some kicks
 

1805
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,230
right and i'm trying to throw some kicks
and he keeps moving back on me do you

1806
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,240
and he keeps moving back on me do you
 

1807
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,190
and he keeps moving back on me do you
get it

1808
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
get it
 

1809
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,109
get it
and he's always out of range of the kick

1810
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
and he's always out of range of the kick
 

1811
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,510
and he's always out of range of the kick
and i start leaving my upper body the

1812
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
and i start leaving my upper body the
 

1813
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,230
and i start leaving my upper body the
same somewhere hiding it my back foot

1814
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
same somewhere hiding it my back foot
 

1815
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,670
same somewhere hiding it my back foot
came in

1816
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
came in
 

1817
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,589
came in
now you can now

1818
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:37,599
now you can now
 

1819
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,430
now you can now
get the extra range you want to do so

1820
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
get the extra range you want to do so
 

1821
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,910
get the extra range you want to do so
there's a bait in there okay

1822
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
there's a bait in there okay
 

1823
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,030
there's a bait in there okay
um

1824
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,040
um
 

1825
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,630
um
and that's what

1826
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
and that's what
 

1827
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,870
and that's what
strategically is going on in that first

1828
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
strategically is going on in that first
 

1829
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,589
strategically is going on in that first
thing okay you're not sitting here

1830
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
thing okay you're not sitting here
 

1831
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,470
thing okay you're not sitting here
and then giving them all the advantage

1832
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,480
and then giving them all the advantage
 

1833
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,510
and then giving them all the advantage
and then

1834
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
and then
 

1835
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,750
and then
so fast i got out of the way of your

1836
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:55,760
so fast i got out of the way of your
 

1837
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,990
so fast i got out of the way of your
action which does not happen

1838
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
action which does not happen
 

1839
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,910
action which does not happen
you get it you cannot get out of the way

1840
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
you get it you cannot get out of the way
 

1841
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,910
you get it you cannot get out of the way
of someone's action

1842
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:01,920
of someone's action
 

1843
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,950
of someone's action
do you guys understand that so uh

1844
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:04,960
do you guys understand that so uh
 

1845
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,150
do you guys understand that so uh
because

1846
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160
because
 

1847
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,150
because
the average human being

1848
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,160
the average human being
 

1849
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,829
the average human being
somewhere around three quarters of a

1850
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
somewhere around three quarters of a
 

1851
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,670
somewhere around three quarters of a
second to a quarter a

1852
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
second to a quarter a
 

1853
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,309
second to a quarter a
second and a half reactionary gap

1854
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
second and a half reactionary gap
 

1855
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,270
second and a half reactionary gap
okay

1856
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
okay
 

1857
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,030
okay
so uh

1858
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
so uh
 

1859
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,870
so uh
he has his hands

1860
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:18,880
he has his hands
 

1861
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,230
he has his hands
right here

1862
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,240
right here
 

1863
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,670
right here
he's gonna clap

1864
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680

 

1865
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,270

he's gonna try to catch my hand before i

1866
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
he's gonna try to catch my hand before i
 

1867
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,349
he's gonna try to catch my hand before i
touch his chest

1868
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
touch his chest
 

1869
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,349
touch his chest
i i am gonna do that

1870
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
i i am gonna do that
 

1871
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,510
i i am gonna do that
you can have it

1872
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
you can have it
 

1873
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,430
you can have it
right

1874
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
right
 

1875
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,750
right
you're gonna every because he has that

1876
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:35,760
you're gonna every because he has that
 

1877
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,150
you're gonna every because he has that
processing time do you see do you got it

1878
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,160
processing time do you see do you got it
 

1879
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,589
processing time do you see do you got it
oh you could be pretty far away too

1880
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599
oh you could be pretty far away too
 

1881
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,550
oh you could be pretty far away too
got it

1882
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:42,560
got it
 

1883
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,030
got it
okay uh so this makes no sense that i

1884
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
okay uh so this makes no sense that i
 

1885
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,349
okay uh so this makes no sense that i
give you a four foot knife

1886
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
give you a four foot knife
 

1887
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,270
give you a four foot knife
hey go i think i can beat your

1888
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,280
hey go i think i can beat your
 

1889
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,109
hey go i think i can beat your
reactionary time

1890
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
reactionary time
 

1891
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,349
reactionary time
do you understand like come on man

1892
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:53,359
do you understand like come on man
 

1893
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,829
do you understand like come on man
uh so you it's a bait bait he

1894
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:56,839
uh so you it's a bait bait he
 

1895
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,030
uh so you it's a bait bait he
sneaks and you're coming around

1896
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,040
sneaks and you're coming around
 

1897
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,150
sneaks and you're coming around
attacking around that uh line of attack

1898
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
