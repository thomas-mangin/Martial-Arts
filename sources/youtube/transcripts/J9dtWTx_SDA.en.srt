but that's what we're aiming for

62
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
but that's what we're aiming for
 

63
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,749
but that's what we're aiming for
you're aiming for

64
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
you're aiming for
 

65
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:38,950

the direction he doesn't know

66
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960

 

67
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,190

because this is the direction again

68
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
because this is the direction again
 

69
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,910
because this is the direction again
because i actually fight with myself

70

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,950
so
i'm changing his direction

74
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
i'm changing his direction
 

75
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,030
i'm changing his direction
mentally

76
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
mentally
 

77
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:07,749
mentally
okay

78

you can
 

81
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,670
you can
on a good night i could put it on there

82
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
on a good night i could put it on there
 

83
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,070
on a good night i could put it on there
where it can slip off and still get it

84
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
where it can slip off and still get it
 

85
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,390
where it can slip off and still get it
because that's again

86
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
because that's again
 

87
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,589
because that's again
because that's the

88
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
because that's the
 

89
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,150
because that's the
i can't do it but again that's the

90
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160

91
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,589
i can't do it but again that's the
direction

92
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599

93
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,150
direction
over there

94
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
over there
 

95
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,309
over there
