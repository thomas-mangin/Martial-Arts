I'm going to go here

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm going to go here
 

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,230
I'm going to go here
and you feel the yong space.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
and you feel the yong space.
 

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,470
and you feel the yong space.
So, tension dog.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480

 

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,029

You'll feel the long space. Okay. Try

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
You'll feel the long space. Okay. Try
 

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,230
You'll feel the long space. Okay. Try
it. I move again.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
it. I move again.
 

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,109
it. I move again.
I do the prescribed grab and I spinal

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
I do the prescribed grab and I spinal
 

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,710

penetrate.
You feel the y. You see?

16
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
You feel the y. You see?
 

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,670
You feel the y. You see?
I don't go like this.

18
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680

 

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,950

Do you see that?

20
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
Do you see that?
 

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,750
Do you see that?
>> When he hits the yaw, I don't go like

22
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760

that.
I just do my job.

26
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
I just do my job.
 

27
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,310
I just do my job.
He feels the yong. That's what we want

28
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
He feels the yong. That's what we want
 

29
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,910
He feels the yong. That's what we want
to feel. Okay. All right.

30
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
to feel. Okay. All right.
 

31
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,790
to feel. Okay. All right.
Why wouldn't this be

32
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
Why wouldn't this be
 

33
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,630
Why wouldn't this be
a yong yong class if I am just trying to

34
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
a yong yong class if I am just trying to
 

35
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,189
a yong yong class if I am just trying to
take him back the way he's coming in?

36
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
take him back the way he's coming in?
 

37
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,310
take him back the way he's coming in?
You get it? Now, if you watch if you

38
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
You get it? Now, if you watch if you
 

39
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,389
You get it? Now, if you watch if you
watch my technique, I'll do two

40
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
watch my technique, I'll do two
 

41
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,710
watch my technique, I'll do two
versions. I'll do what we were saying

42
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
versions. I'll do what we were saying
 

43
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,550
versions. I'll do what we were saying
and then you'll watch my technique. So,

44
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
and then you'll watch my technique. So,
 

45
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,710
and then you'll watch my technique. So,
version A,

46
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720

 

47
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,030

version B.

48
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040

 

49
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,990

Uh

50
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000

 

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,749

uh what's different?

52
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
uh what's different?
 

53
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,390
uh what's different?
One's a projection at that point and one

54
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
One's a projection at that point and one
 

55
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,350
One's a projection at that point and one
is trying to

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360

 

61
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,510

>> Okay. My stance didn't get compromised.

>> Okay. My stance didn't get compromised.
 

63
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,789
>> Okay. My stance didn't get compromised.
I would say

64
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
I would say
 

65
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,670
I would say
>> what's the tension level difference

66
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
>> what's the tension level difference
 

67
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,230
>> what's the tension level difference
to

>> So watch watch my hand.
 

71
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,670
>> So watch watch my hand.
You see

72
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
You see
 

73
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,830
You see
>> watch the other one.

74
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840

 

75
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,510

You can see your tension all going

76
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
You can see your tension all going
 

77
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,069
You can see your tension all going
through here. Okay.

78
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
through here. Okay.
 

79
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,469
through here. Okay.
So yes, I'm internalizing it, but it

80
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
So yes, I'm internalizing it, but it
 

81
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,149
So yes, I'm internalizing it, but it
that concentrically is still not

82
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
that concentrically is still not
 

83
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,429
that concentrically is still not
reconciling it. Okay, so remember I said

84
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
reconciling it. Okay, so remember I said
 

85
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,069
reconciling it. Okay, so remember I said
energetically form does not matter, but

86
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
energetically form does not matter, but
 

87
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,869
energetically form does not matter, but
marginally form does matter. Okay, so

88
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
marginally form does matter. Okay, so
 

89
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,430
marginally form does matter. Okay, so
what I'm going to do here is as he's

90
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
what I'm going to do here is as he's
 

91
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,390
what I'm going to do here is as he's
coming in to touch, I move it move him

92
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
coming in to touch, I move it move him
 

93
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,949
coming in to touch, I move it move him
sideways. So he's going to come in

94
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
sideways. So he's going to come in
 

95
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,790
sideways. So he's going to come in
>> and I move it sideways.

96
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800

 

97
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,550

I let him hit the arm, but I'm moving

98
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
I let him hit the arm, but I'm moving
 

99
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,670
I let him hit the arm, but I'm moving
just a little bit off that straight 180.

100
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680

 

101
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,030

You see how I'm doing that? Okay, try. I

112
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
You see how I'm doing that? Okay, try. I
 

113
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,990
You see how I'm doing that? Okay, try. I
didn't throw. I just reconciled that

114
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
didn't throw. I just reconciled that
 

115
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,710
didn't throw. I just reconciled that
first young clash. He if you fall, you

116
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
first young clash. He if you fall, you
 

117
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,710
first young clash. He if you fall, you
fall. But I'm not trying to throw him.

118
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
fall. But I'm not trying to throw him.
 

119
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,070
fall. But I'm not trying to throw him.
Okay.

120
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080

 

121
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,670

Do a slower mechanics. Andrew,

122
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680

 

123
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,070

that's where we're at. Right.

124
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
that's where we're at. Right.
 

125
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,550
that's where we're at. Right.
>> Right.

126
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
>> Right.
 

127
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,790
>> Right.
>> He's pushing forward. You see?

128
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
>> He's pushing forward. You see?
 

129
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,390
>> He's pushing forward. You see?
So he will gradually increase that

130
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
So he will gradually increase that
 

131
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,550
So he will gradually increase that
pressure till he's full in spinal

132
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
pressure till he's full in spinal
 

133
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,430
pressure till he's full in spinal
displacement.

134
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440

 

135
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,430

This is no different than anything we're

136
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
This is no different than anything we're
 

137
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,990
This is no different than anything we're
doing. If I feel as soon as I feel the

138
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
doing. If I feel as soon as I feel the
 

139
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,149
doing. If I feel as soon as I feel the
pressure, I start reconciling the

140
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
pressure, I start reconciling the
 

141
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,630
pressure, I start reconciling the
pressure. You got it? So we slowing

142
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
pressure. You got it? So we slowing
 

143
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,270
pressure. You got it? So we slowing
everything down. He's going to do it

144
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
everything down. He's going to do it
 

145
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,509
everything down. He's going to do it
gradually.

146
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
gradually.
 

147
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,149
gradually.
There it is.

148
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
There it is.
 

149
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,350
There it is.
Okay. My foot maneuvers. I don't care

150
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
Okay. My foot maneuvers. I don't care
 

151
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,470
Okay. My foot maneuvers. I don't care
how you start, but we have to go 90° to

152
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
how you start, but we have to go 90° to
 

153
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,070
how you start, but we have to go 90° to
the

154
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
the
 

155
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,789
the
to the angle of attack.

156
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799

 

157
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,270

Okay. Try it. Okay. Arm a little behind

158
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
Okay. Try it. Okay. Arm a little behind
 

159
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,949
Okay. Try it. Okay. Arm a little behind
you. Okay. So, he goes about a little

160
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
you. Okay. So, he goes about a little
 

161
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:16,789
you. Okay. So, he goes about a little
late.

162
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799

 

163
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,110

I don't use the arms. We don't need it.

164
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
I don't use the arms. We don't need it.
 

165
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,270
I don't use the arms. We don't need it.
It's not the throw is not in the arm.

166
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
It's not the throw is not in the arm.
 

167
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,069
It's not the throw is not in the arm.
Okay,

168
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
Okay,
 

169
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,990
Okay,

right now.

172
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
right now.
 

173
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,310
right now.
>> He starts to go forward. That's when I

174
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
>> He starts to go forward. That's when I
 

175
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,230
>> He starts to go forward. That's when I
turn. Okay, watch what I do though. I'm

176
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
turn. Okay, watch what I do though. I'm
 

177
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,430
turn. Okay, watch what I do though. I'm
not going to He comes in. I'm not going

178
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
not going to He comes in. I'm not going
 

179
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,350
not going to He comes in. I'm not going
like this.

180
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
like this.
 

181
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,660
like this.
>> I'm doing a triangle back in.

186
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
out in.
 

187
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,909
out in.
>> Okay, try it.

188
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
>> Okay, try it.
 

189
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,310
>> Okay, try it.
>> Don't I I I know I know his body is

190
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
>> Don't I I I know I know his body is
 

191
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,350
>> Don't I I I know I know his body is
going like this. Goes like that and goes

192
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
going like this. Goes like that and goes
 

193
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,070
going like this. Goes like that and goes
like that. I know that. But my arm

194
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
like that. I know that. But my arm
 

195
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,110
like that. I know that. But my arm
doesn't do that.

196
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
doesn't do that.
 

197
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,590
doesn't do that.
You get it? My arm is here. I do that.

198
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
You get it? My arm is here. I do that.
 

199
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,749
You get it? My arm is here. I do that.
You see that? So my arm is here. He

200
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
You see that? So my arm is here. He
 

201
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,950
You see that? So my arm is here. He
presses.

202
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960

 

203
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,110

You see the arm doesn't move. The arm

204
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
You see the arm doesn't move. The arm
 

205
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,189
You see the arm doesn't move. The arm
doesn't curl.

206
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199

 

207
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:27,029

Okay. Try it.

208
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039

 

209
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,390

Okay.

210
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400

 

211
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,029

Here's the hook. You see the hook? Okay.

212
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
Here's the hook. You see the hook? Okay.
 

213
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,870
Here's the hook. You see the hook? Okay.
Here you have your long arm, but you do

214
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
Here you have your long arm, but you do
 

215
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,390
Here you have your long arm, but you do
your long arm straight ahead. You see

216
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
your long arm straight ahead. You see
 

217
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,189
your long arm straight ahead. You see
that? It's hooking it.

218
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
that? It's hooking it.
 

219
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,430
that? It's hooking it.
So when he starts to push and I hook,

220
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
So when he starts to push and I hook,
 

221
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,469
So when he starts to push and I hook,
watch where his center goes. Plot his

222
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
watch where his center goes. Plot his
 

223
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,150
watch where his center goes. Plot his
center in a vertical plane. You

224
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
center in a vertical plane. You
 

225
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,230
center in a vertical plane. You
understand?

226
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
understand?
 

227
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,670
understand?
>> There's the hook. He starts to go.

228
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
>> There's the hook. He starts to go.
 

229
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,830
>> There's the hook. He starts to go.
Came this way.

230
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840

 

231
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,270

Where'd it go?

232
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
Where'd it go?
 

233
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,670
Where'd it go?
>> It went forward. You see that?

234
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
>> It went forward. You see that?
 

235
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,909
>> It went forward. You see that?
>> Do you guys see that? Okay. So that

236
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
>> Do you guys see that? Okay. So that
 

237
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,990
>> Do you guys see that? Okay. So that
means his center of gravity is being

238
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
means his center of gravity is being
 

239
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,510
means his center of gravity is being
deconstructed

240
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
deconstructed
 

241
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,430
deconstructed
from his head. On the other one,

242
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
from his head. On the other one,
 

243
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,189
from his head. On the other one,
I'm pulling his center of gravity this

244
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
I'm pulling his center of gravity this
 

245
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,550
I'm pulling his center of gravity this
way. On this one, I'm letting it go

246
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
way. On this one, I'm letting it go
 

247
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,629
way. On this one, I'm letting it go
forward.

248
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
forward.
 

249
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,110
forward.
That way, he's going forward, but he's

250
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
That way, he's going forward, but he's
 

251
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,270
That way, he's going forward, but he's
falling backwards. Do you understand

252
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
falling backwards. Do you understand
 

253
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,670
falling backwards. Do you understand
that? And so, I don't ever feel his

254
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
that? And so, I don't ever feel his
 

255
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,870
that? And so, I don't ever feel his
weight. It's no different than goes

256
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
weight. It's no different than goes
 

257
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,350
weight. It's no different than goes
forward and then back. I'm just doing it

258
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
forward and then back. I'm just doing it
 

259
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,550
forward and then back. I'm just doing it
on his head. Okay. You do kash like this

260
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
on his head. Okay. You do kash like this
 

261
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,909
on his head. Okay. You do kash like this
and everyone comes this way. Okay. So,

262
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
and everyone comes this way. Okay. So,
 

263
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,230
and everyone comes this way. Okay. So,
don't hook.

264
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
don't hook.
 

265
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,550
don't hook.
Now, ask the question. Then, how do I

266
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
Now, ask the question. Then, how do I
 

267
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,189
Now, ask the question. Then, how do I
make him move that way? What do you

268
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
make him move that way? What do you
 

269
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,110
make him move that way? What do you
think it is?

270
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
think it is?
 

271
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,110
think it is?
>> Okay. And what's generating the adhesion

272
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
>> Okay. And what's generating the adhesion
 

273
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,670
>> Okay. And what's generating the adhesion
here?

274
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
here?
 

275
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,870
here?
>> His initial inertia.

276
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
>> His initial inertia.
 

277
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,589
>> His initial inertia.
>> His initial inertia. He's he's he's

278
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
>> His initial inertia. He's he's he's
 

279
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,790
>> His initial inertia. He's he's he's
pressing on that. I use that to move

280
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
pressing on that. I use that to move
 

281
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,510
pressing on that. I use that to move
him. You see that? Okay. All right. Try

282
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
him. You see that? Okay. All right. Try
 

283
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,990
him. You see that? Okay. All right. Try
a yong aspect. I keep that yong aspect.

284
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
a yong aspect. I keep that yong aspect.
 

285
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,510
a yong aspect. I keep that yong aspect.
This is what I when you hear me say I

286
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
This is what I when you hear me say I
 

287
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,990
This is what I when you hear me say I
equalize his yong aspect. Okay? So for

288
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
equalize his yong aspect. Okay? So for
 

289
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,990
equalize his yong aspect. Okay? So for
example,

290
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
example,
 

291
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,790
example,
if I go under value, there's no

292
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
if I go under value, there's no
 

293
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,589
if I go under value, there's no
adhesion. He didn't come that way. If I

294
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
adhesion. He didn't come that way. If I
 

295
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,950
adhesion. He didn't come that way. If I
go over value, I'm now contesting. But

296
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
go over value, I'm now contesting. But
 

297
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,710
go over value, I'm now contesting. But
if I match him, he gets stuck to me. Can

298
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
if I match him, he gets stuck to me. Can
 

299
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,670
if I match him, he gets stuck to me. Can
you see that? Can you feel feel

300
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
you see that? Can you feel feel
 

301
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,070
you see that? Can you feel feel
your skin go like that? Okay. Okay. So,

302
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
your skin go like that? Okay. Okay. So,
 

303
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,629
your skin go like that? Okay. Okay. So,
wait till you There we go.

304
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639

 

305
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,110

Yeah. Okay. So, got it. So, he's

306
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
Yeah. Okay. So, got it. So, he's
 

307
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,830
Yeah. Okay. So, got it. So, he's
trapped. He can't go anywhere. And this

308
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
trapped. He can't go anywhere. And this
 

309
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,070
trapped. He can't go anywhere. And this
is what I meant this morning when I say

310
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
is what I meant this morning when I say
 

311
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,749
is what I meant this morning when I say
Iikido Kihon is using the inertia, the

312
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
Iikido Kihon is using the inertia, the
 

313
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,029
Iikido Kihon is using the inertia, the
centrial energy, the centrial energy to

314
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
centrial energy, the centrial energy to
 

315
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,909
centrial energy, the centrial energy to
generate what close-range grappling is

316
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
generate what close-range grappling is
 

317
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,830
generate what close-range grappling is
trying to do with fulcrums and leopards.

318
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
trying to do with fulcrums and leopards.
 

319
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,390
trying to do with fulcrums and leopards.
So now it's not that I'm trying to

320
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
So now it's not that I'm trying to
 

321
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,469
So now it's not that I'm trying to
leverage his head, his whole body. I

322
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
leverage his head, his whole body. I
 

323
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,029
leverage his head, his whole body. I
make the lever with the inertia going

324
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
make the lever with the inertia going
 

325
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,990
make the lever with the inertia going
forward.

326
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
forward.
 

327
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,390
forward.
Got it? And so watch my hand.

328
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400

 

329
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,029

There's no tension in the arm. Okay. Try

330
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
There's no tension in the arm. Okay. Try
 

331
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,189
There's no tension in the arm. Okay. Try
it again.

332
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
it again.
 

333
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,790
it again.
Okay. So we're here and my drill is just

334
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
Okay. So we're here and my drill is just
 

335
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,990
Okay. So we're here and my drill is just
on the first step. So he goes to press.

336
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
on the first step. So he goes to press.
 

337
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,990
on the first step. So he goes to press.
What did I do wrong?

338
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
What did I do wrong?
 

339
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,790
What did I do wrong?
>> So behind me I went under yong value.

Go
 

343
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:50,710
Go
over yong value.

Just this foot. I don't care what
happens. You can do it

348
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
happens. You can do it
 

349
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,190
happens. You can do it
with the other foot. Don't do this row.

350
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
with the other foot. Don't do this row.
 

351
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,829
with the other foot. Don't do this row.
Just bring it this way. Make sure his

It's not that I turn
cuz now the angle didn't change in his

He's pushing and we mentioned stable
 

421
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,430
He's pushing and we mentioned stable
base. Push, push, push, push. We

422
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
base. Push, push, push, push. We
 

423
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,630
base. Push, push, push, push. We
mentioned stable base. We come up,

424
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640

 

425
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,590

428
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640

 

429
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:58,310

I have a stable. I move into stable.

430
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320

 

431
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,750

I don't go from here.

432
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
I don't go from here.
 

433
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,190
I don't go from here.
Not stable base. Okay. I will move out

434
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
Not stable base. Okay. I will move out
 

435
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,350
Not stable base. Okay. I will move out
of the way so I don't trip him cuz I'm

436
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
of the way so I don't trip him cuz I'm
 

437
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,110
of the way so I don't trip him cuz I'm
not doing the throw. But I move the same

438
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
not doing the throw. But I move the same
 

439
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,910
not doing the throw. But I move the same
way.

440
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
way.
 

441
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,790
way.
Okay. Try to reduce the steps because

442
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay. Try to reduce the steps because
 

443
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,269
Okay. Try to reduce the steps because
the more steps we need, the further we

444
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
the more steps we need, the further we
 

445
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,190
the more steps we need, the further we
are from the technique. Technique's two

446
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
are from the technique. Technique's two
 

447
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,389
are from the technique. Technique's two
steps. So

448
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
steps. So
 

449
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,990
steps. So
here

450
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
here
 

451
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,630
here
he's pressing

452
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640

 

453
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,509

and okay. There's something else that

454
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
and okay. There's something else that
 

455
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,030
and okay. There's something else that
happens.

456
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
happens.
 

457
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,030
happens.
Um

458
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
Um
 

459
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,910
Um
and it's in those 10 off techniques.

460
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920

 

461
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,710

There's balance is going in one

462
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
There's balance is going in one
 

463
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,190
There's balance is going in one
direction, right? As I tilt that spine

464
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
direction, right? As I tilt that spine
 

465
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,230
direction, right? As I tilt that spine
and when I crunch his spine anyway,

466
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
and when I crunch his spine anyway,
 

467
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,389
and when I crunch his spine anyway,
what happens to my line of gravity? So,

468
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
what happens to my line of gravity? So,
 

469
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,069
what happens to my line of gravity? So,
pay attention. I crunch it, it's moving

470
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
pay attention. I crunch it, it's moving
 

471
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,949
pay attention. I crunch it, it's moving
back under my basic support. Do you see

472
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
back under my basic support. Do you see
 

473
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,509
back under my basic support. Do you see
that? We have to keep the spine

474
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
that? We have to keep the spine
 

475
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,389
that? We have to keep the spine
extending on the initial

476
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
extending on the initial
 

477
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,829
extending on the initial
kizushi pattern. So when we do

478
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839

 

479
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,910

we're here. Don't ask for me. He he goes

480
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
we're here. Don't ask for me. He he goes
 

481
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,710
we're here. Don't ask for me. He he goes
forward and I go like that and I crunch

482
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
forward and I go like that and I crunch
 

483
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,110
forward and I go like that and I crunch
that spine. His legs get back under him.

484
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
that spine. His legs get back under him.
 

485
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:33,110
that spine. His legs get back under him.
We go. I keep his spine long.

486
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120

 

487
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,110

That's how I want you to do this throw.

488
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120

 

489
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,910

You are going to feel there's no entry

490
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
You are going to feel there's no entry
 

491
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,230
You are going to feel there's no entry
line. You're going to feel this

492
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
line. You're going to feel this
 

493
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,389
line. You're going to feel this
that part. That part got heavy. Okay.

494
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
that part. That part got heavy. Okay.
 

495
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,550
that part. That part got heavy. Okay.
The kazushi is there as far as his spine

496
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
The kazushi is there as far as his spine
 

497
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,790
The kazushi is there as far as his spine
goes.

498
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
goes.
 

499
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,069
goes.
But that's heavy. You see? See how his

500
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
But that's heavy. You see? See how his
 

501
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,910
But that's heavy. You see? See how his
spine was going that way? It kept going

502
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
spine was going that way? It kept going
 

503
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,230
spine was going that way? It kept going
that way. But it got heavy. I want you

504
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
that way. But it got heavy. I want you
 

505
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:14,069
that way. But it got heavy. I want you
to feel the heaviness. Okay. Try it.

506
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079

 

507
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,030

Just going to lengthen the spine.

508
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040

 

509
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,910

Whoops.

510
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920

 

511
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,350

Whoops. Okay. Go slower. Go slower.

512
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
Whoops. Okay. Go slower. Go slower.
 

513
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,030
Whoops. Okay. Go slower. Go slower.
Really slow.

514
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040

 

515
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,230

There's no injury. I moved off.

516
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
There's no injury. I moved off.
 

517
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,470
There's no injury. I moved off.
Okay.

518
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480

 

519
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,150

Okay. Got it. Okay. Try because you're

520
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
Okay. Got it. Okay. Try because you're
 

521
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,350
Okay. Got it. Okay. Try because you're
not moving into the in space. Okay. So,

522
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
not moving into the in space. Okay. So,
 

523
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,030
not moving into the in space. Okay. So,
when he goes here, we're going to have

524
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
when he goes here, we're going to have
 

525
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,829
when he goes here, we're going to have
to act it out. Okay. And I have his

526
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
to act it out. Okay. And I have his
 

527
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,310
to act it out. Okay. And I have his
center going forward and his body's

528
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
center going forward and his body's
 

529
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,790
center going forward and his body's
going back here.

530
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
going back here.
 

531
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,829
going back here.
His inertia was going forward and you

532
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
His inertia was going forward and you
 

533
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,389
His inertia was going forward and you
lengthen his spine. That's where the ump

534
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
lengthen his spine. That's where the ump
 

535
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,189
lengthen his spine. That's where the ump
comes from. You see what I'm going to do

536
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
comes from. You see what I'm going to do
 

537
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,990
comes from. You see what I'm going to do
instead is the center is going forward.

538
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
instead is the center is going forward.
 

539
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,389
instead is the center is going forward.
I go ahead and walk my friend. I'm

540
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
I go ahead and walk my friend. I'm
 

541
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,870
I go ahead and walk my friend. I'm
moving here.

542
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880

 

543
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,509

The pressure on my arm does not change.

544
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
The pressure on my arm does not change.
 

545
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,110
The pressure on my arm does not change.
If I stay here, pressure increases on my

546
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
If I stay here, pressure increases on my
 

547
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,750
If I stay here, pressure increases on my
arm.

548
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
arm.
 

549
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,110
arm.
I move into the inspace.

550
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
I move into the inspace.
 

551
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,230
I move into the inspace.
Keeps the pressure the same on my arm.

552
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
Keeps the pressure the same on my arm.
 

553
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,550
Keeps the pressure the same on my arm.
I'm not throwing him. Yes, that's the X

554
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm not throwing him. Yes, that's the X
 

555
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,389
I'm not throwing him. Yes, that's the X
pattern angle, but I'm not throwing him.

556
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
pattern angle, but I'm not throwing him.
 

557
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,590
pattern angle, but I'm not throwing him.
Okay. What I want you to do

558
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
Okay. What I want you to do
 

559
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,150
Okay. What I want you to do
is whatever it just felt like to me it

560
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
is whatever it just felt like to me it
 

561
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,670
is whatever it just felt like to me it
feels like two palms. Keep it two pound.

562
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
feels like two palms. Keep it two pound.
 

563
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,790
feels like two palms. Keep it two pound.
Okay.

564
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800

 

565
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,990

So, I'm moving to keep that contact. I'm

566
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
So, I'm moving to keep that contact. I'm
 

567
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,790
So, I'm moving to keep that contact. I'm
not moving to make his head move. Okay.

568
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
not moving to make his head move. Okay.
 

569
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,590
not moving to make his head move. Okay.
All right. Try it. Can you tell me if

570
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
All right. Try it. Can you tell me if
 

571
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,150
All right. Try it. Can you tell me if
that is bending his back?

572
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
that is bending his back?
 

573
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:28,069
that is bending his back?
Okay.

574
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079

 

575
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,910

That's the drill. Okay, try it again.

576
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
That's the drill. Okay, try it again.
 

577
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,710
That's the drill. Okay, try it again.
What I'm going to do is go around

578
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
What I'm going to do is go around
 

579
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:44,230
What I'm going to do is go around
everything. Come on, Sean.

580
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240

 

581
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,710

You see? So, I'll leave this part out

582
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
You see? So, I'll leave this part out
 

583
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,590
You see? So, I'll leave this part out
and you'll see the fall still happens.

584
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600

 

585
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,910

You see? So when this arm is going into

586
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
You see? So when this arm is going into
 

587
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,389
You see? So when this arm is going into
the inward spiral, which way do you

588
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
the inward spiral, which way do you
 

589
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,670
the inward spiral, which way do you
think he's going

590
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
think he's going
 

591
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,470
think he's going
>> down? Do you understand? It's not me

592
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
>> down? Do you understand? It's not me
 

593
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,990
>> down? Do you understand? It's not me
pushing him down. It's not me shoving

594
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
pushing him down. It's not me shoving
 

595
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,949
pushing him down. It's not me shoving
him down cuz he was going that way. I

596
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
him down cuz he was going that way. I
 

597
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,590
him down cuz he was going that way. I
turned his whole body and now I'm just

598
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
turned his whole body and now I'm just
 

599
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,990
turned his whole body and now I'm just
staying with it. I'm not pushing it

600
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
staying with it. I'm not pushing it
 

601
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,749
staying with it. I'm not pushing it
down. It's now going that way. And I'm

602
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
down. It's now going that way. And I'm
 

603
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,030
down. It's now going that way. And I'm
now blending it to keep his spine long.

604
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
now blending it to keep his spine long.
 

605
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,749
now blending it to keep his spine long.
Do you see that difference? So I'm not

606
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
Do you see that difference? So I'm not
 

607
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,749
Do you see that difference? So I'm not
going here

608
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
going here
 

609
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,350
going here
shoving this down. He already is falling

610
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
shoving this down. He already is falling
 

611
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,590
shoving this down. He already is falling
right there.

612
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
right there.
 

613
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,590
right there.
That move is not pushing on him. He's

614
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
That move is not pushing on him. He's
 

615
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,910
That move is not pushing on him. He's
going with him. Okay. So to get there, I

616
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
going with him. Okay. So to get there, I
 

617
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,710
going with him. Okay. So to get there, I
want you to understand

618
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
want you to understand
 

619
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,350
want you to understand
that first contact that you play, you go

620
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
that first contact that you play, you go
 

621
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,629
that first contact that you play, you go
here. Second one, don't shove. Move

622
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
here. Second one, don't shove. Move
 

623
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,110
here. Second one, don't shove. Move
around. So, what am I moving around?

624
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
around. So, what am I moving around?
 

625
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,590
around. So, what am I moving around?
Moving around that. And I'm moving

626
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
Moving around that. And I'm moving
 

627
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,389
Moving around that. And I'm moving
through this h space.

628
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
through this h space.
 

629
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,389
through this h space.
That's the technique.

630
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
That's the technique.
 

631
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,949
That's the technique.
Go right now. Okay. What would be wrong?

632
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959

 

633
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,470

What would be wrong? He goes and I move

634
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
What would be wrong? He goes and I move
 

635
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,309
What would be wrong? He goes and I move
this.

636
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
this.
 

637
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,429
this.
I can't push it.

638
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
I can't push it.
 

639
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,630
I can't push it.
right here. Stay there. Keep this value.

640
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
right here. Stay there. Keep this value.
 

641
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,230
right here. Stay there. Keep this value.
Whatever that feels like to you, keep

642
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
Whatever that feels like to you, keep
 

643
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,429
Whatever that feels like to you, keep
it. Don't move into him. Move where

644
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
it. Don't move into him. Move where
 

645
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,630
it. Don't move into him. Move where
there's space.

646
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
there's space.
 

647
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,630
there's space.
Okay, that's the drill. Try it. Come do

648
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
Okay, that's the drill. Try it. Come do
 

649
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,070
Okay, that's the drill. Try it. Come do
that. Okay, watch something else. Okay,

650
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
that. Okay, watch something else. Okay,
 

651
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,669
that. Okay, watch something else. Okay,
that's where he is in he's going to be

652
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
that's where he is in he's going to be
 

653
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,750
that's where he is in he's going to be
