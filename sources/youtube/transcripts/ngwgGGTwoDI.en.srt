00:00:46,270 --> 00:01:04,660

still getting yeah still you have to hit

2
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:04,670
still getting yeah still you have to hit
 

3
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,670
still getting yeah still you have to hit
it on the positive side can hit it on

4
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:06,680
it on the positive side can hit it on
 

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:04:15,110
it on the positive side can hit it on
top range right there you go

6
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120

 

7
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,920

so you see somebody she left the phone

8
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:18,930
so you see somebody she left the phone
 

9
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,100
so you see somebody she left the phone
okay let's rewind behind this technique

10
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,110
okay let's rewind behind this technique
 

11
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:30,710
okay let's rewind behind this technique
better we'll start on your objective so

12
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
better we'll start on your objective so
 

13
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,990
better we'll start on your objective so
I'm going to create an angle deflection

14
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to create an angle deflection
 

15
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,970
I'm going to create an angle deflection
and join it with the angle of daeviation

16
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:38,980
and join it with the angle of daeviation
 

17
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,000
and join it with the angle of daeviation
about it and an angle of attack phone so

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,010
about it and an angle of attack phone so
 

19
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,980
about it and an angle of attack phone so
I need to be able to see what you can

20
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:49,990
I need to be able to see what you can
 

21
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,450

put your hair but I need to have my body
of law here so that this hand can drop

24
00:04:59,700 --> 00:04:59,710
of law here so that this hand can drop
 

25
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,270
of law here so that this hand can drop
under my Center things start going wrong

26
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
under my Center things start going wrong
 

27
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,879
under my Center things start going wrong
when i do this it's not going to drop my

28
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:08,889
when i do this it's not going to drop my
 

29
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,060
when i do this it's not going to drop my
device and drop me outside my face

30
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,070
device and drop me outside my face
 

31
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,920
device and drop me outside my face
you'll see that you'll do that a lot you

32
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:13,930
you'll see that you'll do that a lot you
 

33
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,840
you'll see that you'll do that a lot you
move it over here you go too far the

34
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:18,850
move it over here you go too far the
 

35
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,450
move it over here you go too far the
light it so that the center can be

36
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:21,460
light it so that the center can be
 

37
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,450
light it so that the center can be
filled by the hand you don't have your

38
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,460
filled by the hand you don't have your
 

39
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,000
filled by the hand you don't have your
heel to arch alignment or worse you turn

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,010
heel to arch alignment or worse you turn
 

41
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:34,469
heel to arch alignment or worse you turn
them and you over like that if you step

42
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
them and you over like that if you step
 

43
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,210
them and you over like that if you step
too far out right in your back here what

44
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,220
too far out right in your back here what
 

45
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
too far out right in your back here what
happened you met

46
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,230
happened you met
 

47
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,740
happened you met
so there's not just the width of my

48
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:42,750
so there's not just the width of my
 

49
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,880
so there's not just the width of my
stance but the distance of my stance and

50
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:46,890
stance but the distance of my stance and
 

51
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,760
stance but the distance of my stance and
the depth of my stance so foot here foot

52
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:52,770
the depth of my stance so foot here foot

here are not not reaching goes one and
 

55
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,300
here are not not reaching goes one and
then I'm going to move this then I can

56
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,310
then I'm going to move this then I can
 

57
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,850
then I'm going to move this then I can
put my weight on the further i am on the

58
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:07,860
put my weight on the further i am on the
 

59

it's going to be to make that end heavy

62
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,100

 

63
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,410

the preceding angle deflections has you

64
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:20,420
the preceding angle deflections has you
 

65
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,260
the preceding angle deflections has you
right not at the end of the jump so

66
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,270
right not at the end of the jump so
 

67
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,140
right not at the end of the jump so
