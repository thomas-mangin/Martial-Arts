okay so the faster what we go slow right
and I'm doing this and if he goes really
fast it can be really small then I don't
have to preoccupy myself with defending
my gun right so I won't hit you baby you
go fast right same exact thing
if I want to strike right I'm free to
move I'm also right ready to draw my
weapon I don't have to sit here and go
you understand you just you make it look
stupid cuz he is stupid right we're
trying to grab my gun so I'm here
they're not just there all over - same
thing like the shoulder push right not
this big deviation just the blend fast
hard hard hmm
that's all I need okay let's try us pick
it up
