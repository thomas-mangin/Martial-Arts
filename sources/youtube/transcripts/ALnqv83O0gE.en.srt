in chin Buddha in 1942 so that's the
 

341
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,930
in chin Buddha in 1942 so that's the

present from the dietary techniques then

348
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:58,850
present from the dietary techniques then
 

349
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,790
present from the dietary techniques then
could it be possibly coming from his

350
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
could it be possibly coming from his
 

351
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,430
could it be possibly coming from his
experience in Japan jutsu which was

352
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
experience in Japan jutsu which was
 

353
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,660
experience in Japan jutsu which was

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
to what we do know there but you will

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,680
up like that but again this watch kata I
don't know and I can't I can tell to be

it is different and maybe not good but

632
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
it is different and maybe not good but
 

633
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,039
it is different and maybe not good but
that's fair to say also that obviously

634
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:15,049
that's fair to say also that obviously

right and so I mean we're in assignment
 

639
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,390
right and so I mean we're in assignment
