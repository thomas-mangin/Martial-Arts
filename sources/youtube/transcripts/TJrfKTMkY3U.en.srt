1
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:50,999
How did you start your budo practice?

2
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,999
Before starting Budo, I did some athletics,

3
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,999
when I was in high school.

4
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,999
I became pretty good at it.

5
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:06,999
In 1961, there was a summer course with Nakamura Tempu.

6
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:12,999
It took place in Osaka for 14 days and at the end,

7
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,999
Hisa Takuma Sensei did a demonstration.

8
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:18,999
Actually, Hisa Sensei didn't do himself

9
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:22,999
but he had people who did Judo come on stage,

10
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,999
as well as young girls.

11
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:31,999
He taught them things like nikajo shuto zume.

12
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,917
If young girls could make it work,

13
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,999
I thought I could do it to, in spite of my small body.

14
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,083
That said,

15
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,999
I hadn't participated in the exercise but I wanted to do it,

16
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:49,999
so I joined a club called the Kansai Aikido Club.

17
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:58,999
Hisa Sensei had re-opened a dojo in 1959.

18
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:03,999
There was a long time between the time he received the menkyo kaiden [1939] and the end of the war.

19
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:08,999
That said, I think that he was often invited teach to variety of events here and there.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,999
That's how he started.

21
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,999
There was no break.

22
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:22,999
The first thing that you saw was the sign that said: "Daito-ryu Aikido".

23
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:25,999
The sign said: "Aikido Club"

24
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:32,999
In reality, perhaps it should have been: "Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu"

25
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:41,999
but the general public would not know what it was so they wrote "Kansai Aikido Club".

26
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:48,999
The things Hisa Sensei taught me were...

27
00:02:48,999 --> 00:03:00,999
A week or two before I joined in October 1961, he suffered form a stroke.

28
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:06,999
I visited his house to see him, but he had hemiplegia.

29
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:12,999
After a while, he did return to the dojo although he walked with a cane.

30
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,999
What I learned was...

31
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:21,999
Well, since I was a student, I took most of the ukemi during practice

32
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:26,999
so I could understand roughly the techniques he taught from that experience.

33
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,999
Most of those were Ueshiba Sensei's techniques.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,999
That's why in spite of being called Daito-ryu, the influence of Ueshiba Morihei Sensei's teachings was huge.

35
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,208
Doing this and doing that.

36
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:44,999
If Hisa Sensei taught Daito-ryu, why did he call his dojo "Kansai Aikido Club" instead of "Daito-ryu Club"?

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,999
This is Ueshiba Sensei's influence.

38
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:51,999
If it had said "Aiki-jujutsu", there probably noone would have come.

39
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,999
Guillaume, you don't know this

40
00:03:54,999 --> 00:04:01,999
but the Osaka Gas company was located diagonally across from the intersection facing the dojo.

41
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:02,999
It was a first-rate location.

42
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,999
It was there.

43
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:14,999
White collar workers would see the sign and come since it was located in the same building as many different businesses such as the Saitama Bank.

44
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,999
And they would watch.

45
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,999
If it had been called  Ju-jutsu, no one would have come.

46
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,208
G. E. : Because it looked strict or old-fashioned?

47
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,417
I guess that's how it became Aikido.

48
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,999
Well, I never really asked and confirmed but that's my assumption.

49
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:32,625
Hisa Sensei received the 8th Dan from Ueshiba Sensei. Was it before or after setting up the club?

50
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,999
Ummm, it was in 1956.

51
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,999
That's when Hisa Sensei went to Tokyo.

52
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,999
I'll give you some reference materials next time.

53
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,999
I have a document that I wrote based on my research.

54
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,999
I believe it was 1956.

55
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,999
When he went to Tokyo, he received a Dan grade.

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,166
He said it was the first and last time he ever received one.

57
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:58,999
He said he got an 8th Dan unexpectedly without getting either lower Kyu or Dan grades.

58
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,999
That certificate was hanged up at the dojo.

59
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,999
G. E. : Yes, there is a picture of it in Mori Sensei's book.

60
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,999
I don't know about those pictures.

61
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:19,999
Can you talk about the university club that you founded?

62
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,999
Ah. I founded a Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu club at university.

63
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,999
It was at Momoyama Gakuin University.

64
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:29,999
G. E. : but it was separate from Kansai Aikido Club...

65
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,999
Yes, yes, it was separate

66
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,709
I was studying there so I started a club at that school.

67
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,208
I started the club to practice Daito-ryu

68
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,999
but there was no such thing in other universities.

69
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,041
I did not feel confident doing it

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,999
but Hisa Sensei was still healthy and well.

71
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,999
Hisa Sensei didn't have a successor.

72
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,999
When it came to who would be the instructor, it would have been the best if he did it.

73
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,999
But once Hisa Sensei was gone, it wouldn't work out.

74
00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:01,999
Hisa wouldn't come over all the way because he had difficulties walking with his cane.

75
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,999
So instead of being part of the Kansai Aikido Club,

76
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,999
our club was affiliated to the Kansai Student Aikido Federation.

77
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:12,999
Now there are others like the Kanto Student Aikido Federation.

78
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,999
There are many federations,

79
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,999
and there is the National Student Aikido Federation.

80
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:22,917
When I found out, I realized that we should affiliate with them.

81
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:27,999
This is when Kobayashi Hirokazu Sensei was put in charge by Kisshomaru Doshu?

82
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:33,999
It's at that time that I met Kobayashi Hirokazu Sensei.

83
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:38,999
I was introduced to him by a student of Kwansei Gakuin Univerisity.

84
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,999
G.E. : From that point you did only Aikido?

85
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,625
From that point I did both.

86
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:48,667
During my college years, I did Aikido at school during the day because Kobayashi Sensei would come.

87
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:54,999
In the evening, I trained [in Daito-ryu] at the Kansai Aikido Club.

88
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,500
At lunchtime too.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,999


90
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,999
So my technique is quite original.

91
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:05,917
There was no leader at that time.

92
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,999
There could have been one but everyone had to work.

93
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:14,250
How old were you at that time?

94
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,999
I was about 20.

95
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:20,999
G. E. : You were young...

96
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Kobayashi Sensei told me that since I studied very seriously, I should teach Daito-ryu professionally,

97
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,220
and that he would support me.

98
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,999
But who knows if I would have been able to make a living with it.

99
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:31,999
It was definitely not possible.

100
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:40,999
In 1975, the Asahi Culture Center was created at Senri Kaikan.

101
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,999
Then they made a second one in Yokohama.

102
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:48,542
Perhaps the first one was in Tokyo.

103
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,999
Soon followed by the second one.

104
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,999
When building the second one, the Asahi Newspaper was there, so they constructed a building on that spot.

105
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,999
I guess that's when they decided to build it for Budo purposes.

106
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,999
They asked Hisa sensei.

107
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:06,999
Well, an Asahi Newspaper employee who used to be Hisa Sensei's colleague back in the asked him to send a disciple .

108
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,999
"Would you like to do it?"

109
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:15,999
That person, his name is Yamada, but he asked : "How about you, Kobayashi".

110
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,999
I decided to take the offer and teach.

111
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,999
Slowly we institutionalized it.

112
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,375
The disciples then started creating branches.

113
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:30,999
Did Kobayahsi Hirokazu Sensei learn any Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu from Hisa Sensei?

114
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,999
He learned some,

115
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,999
but it was only for a brief period though.

116
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:40,999
A became a [Aikikai Hombu Dojo] uchi deshi after the war and came back to Osaka only afterwards.

117
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,291
There was already a branch in Osaka led by Tanaka Bansen.

118
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,999
So then there were two.

119
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,500
In the past, there would have been only one branch per prefecture.

120
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:58,999
Ueshiba Sensei would visit Mr Kobayashi instead of Mr Tanaka.

121
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:05,999
Once every two months or so, there was time for instruction.

122
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,999
He would come to teach us.

123
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:19,999
During those times, we would have combined training with both students and adults at the Fukushima Station gymnasium.

124
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:25,999
You actually did study under Ueshiba Morihei for a while didn't you?

125
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:34,834
I got a reference letter from Hisa Sensei to go train under Ueshiba sensei.

126
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:41,999
So I went to Ueshiba Sensei's dojo in 1965.

127
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,166
It wasn't for long though, about one month.

128
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,999
I did like the uchi deshi.

129
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,999
G. E. : It was in Tokyo?

130
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,999
Yes, it was at the old Tokyo Hombu Dojo

131
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:59,999
I believe O Sensei's classes were on Mondays.

132
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,999
I think it's still the same nowadays.

133
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:10,999
All the uchi deshi were gathering there and practice was intense.

134
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:17,999
The other days were taught by the Dojo-cho Kisshomaru Sensei.

135
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,999
Actually, there was no Dojo-cho a the time...

136
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:21,999
G.E. : Wasn't it Osawa Sensei?

137
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:26,999
No, actually, it was Tohei Sensei.

138
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:33,999
Tohei Sensei used to come and teach during the second morning class.

139
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:34,999
G.E. : The one at 8 a.m.

140
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:42,999
Fujita Sensei also taught some of the second morning classes on Mondays.

141
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:45,999
Tohei Sensei taught on the other days.

142
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:48,999
They had a rotation schedule.

143
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:56,999
After the two morning classes, I would go back to rest for a while,

144
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:02,999
and around 3 or 4 o'clock, I would go to the Yoshinkan.

145
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:08,000
After that, I went back to Hombu Dojo to train in the evening.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I did this routine for about a month.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,999
G. E. : The Yoshinkan was in Iidabashi, right?

148
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:17,750
Yes, it was in Iidabashi, it was the oldest training place.

149
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,083
It's not there anymore because they moved.

150
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:28,999
How did the techniques you learned at Hombu compare to that of Daito-ryu?

151
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,458
The Sensei of the Hombu Dojo had different styles.

152
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,999
Techniques that are common now were common then, too.

153
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,999
Not much has changed.

154
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,999
Ikkyo, nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo, shiho nage, irimi nage...

155
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:49,999
against strikes and grabs.

156
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:54,999
There was no hanza handachi [hanmi handachi], nor ushiro dori at the Hombu Dojo.

157
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,999
There was ushiro ryote dori though...

158
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,999
Other than that, there wasn't much.

159
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:06,583
Did you know Arikawa Sensei?

160
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,999
Not well, but Arikawa sensei was a big fan of the Takumakai.

161
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:15,999
Whenever there was a demonstration, he would always come see.

162
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,999
I don't not too much about it, but apparently,

163
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:25,999
Mr Kobayashi, a student of Tokiumne Sensei from Kobe was in contact with him.

164
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,999
Personally, I didn't have much contact with him.

165
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,999
Arikawa Sensei was very passionate.

166
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:37,999
When I watch Arikawa Sensei's demonstrations, I'm often reminded of Daito-ryu.

167
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,999
I can't say whether it was an influence.

168
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:51,999
There was a handout made that listed the first 118 Daito-ryu techniques.

169
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,291
It was given as a reference.

170
00:12:55,291 --> 00:13:00,999
It was a handwritten book published by Ueshiba Sensei.

171
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,999
G. E. : Yes, it's the book called "Budo Renshu".

172
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,999
Yes, the really thick one. I received it.

173
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:08,999
G. E. : The one without photographs...

174
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,166
That's right, without photos.

175
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,999
I'm still taking a good care of it since there probably isn't anything like that nowadays.

176
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:27,999
There were also stories about the pictures and films taken at the Asahi Journal.

177
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:34,999
It showed the techniques taught by Ueshiba Sensei.

178
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:46,999
Stanley Pranin found the film shot at the Osaka Asahi Newspaper and organized a projection.

179
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,999
During the projection, Takeda Tokimune Sensei got angry.

180
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,999
"Ah! This is Daito-ryu isn't it?"

181
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:59,999
I guess to Ueshiba Sensei, Daitoryu is Daitoryu because Kisshomaru sensei performs it.

182
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:04,999
I don't know what the difference is.

183
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:11,999
Ueshiba Sensei learned many techniques from Takeda [Sokaku] Sensei,

184
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:20,999
but he modified and unified them to facilitate the movements.

185
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:24,999
Well, of course the origin is Daito-ryu, and it must have had a great influence.

186
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:31,667
Many teachers have different backgrounds like Yagyu shinkage-ryu and Kitou-ryu for an example.

187
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,999
So obviously it's very difficult to tell which techniques come from which school.

188
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,999
It may also be connected to the sword of Ono-ha.

189
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:45,999
Daito-ryu values greatly the sword from Ono-ha during training.
