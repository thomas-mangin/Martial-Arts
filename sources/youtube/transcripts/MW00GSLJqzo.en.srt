your cook you hope you have your outward
spirals our spiral is just the reverse

134
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,280
spirals our spiral is just the reverse
 

135
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,129
spirals our spiral is just the reverse
or the inverse of the inverse spiral

136
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:22,139
or the inverse of the inverse spiral
 

137
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,050

it's the same technique

it's the same technique
 

139
