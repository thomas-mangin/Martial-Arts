timing and that is a lot okay so in this

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,140
timing and that is a lot okay so in this
 

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,150
timing and that is a lot okay so in this
drill we're going to use the Vulcan as a

12
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
drill we're going to use the Vulcan as a
 

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,009
drill we're going to use the Vulcan as a
training vector and the tsuba

00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,019
training vector and the tsuba
 

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,990
training vector and the tsuba
as a minimal protection for this guy for

and intention of
reference point okay as my show

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:43,860
reference point okay as my show
 

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,990
reference point okay as my show
has to go into his Center

it's not going just here

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,260
it's not going just here
 

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,990
it's not going just here
so this is our training Factor

28
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,270

I'm at my angle

I'm at my angle
 

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,110
I'm at my angle
I bring the weapon up

is to not move his sword over

I'm gonna go around his sword
 

63
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,970
I'm gonna go around his sword

75
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,869

okay let's get in that ballpark try

76
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:23,879

 

77
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,729

at the end of Marcus you have a ski

78
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:28,739
at the end of Marcus you have a ski
 

79
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,510
at the end of Marcus you have a ski
so my feet have to end up apart

80
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:32,520
so my feet have to end up apart
 

81
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,250
so my feet have to end up apart
if you reverse that

82
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,260

 

83
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,449

your feet should start under your hips

84
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:41,459

 

85
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,530

so when you do the drill

86
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,540

 

87
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,330

no

88
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,340
no
 

89
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,710
no
you're going to have a little ski

90
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:51,720

 

91
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,949

you want a big ski

92
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
you want a big ski
 

93
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,630
you want a big ski

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,140

 

97
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,630

so Peter are under your hips

98
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640

 

99
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,270

second point

100
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
second point
 

101
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,350
second point
don't have the weapon traveling down

102
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
don't have the weapon traveling down
 

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,630
don't have the weapon traveling down
as you're going under

104
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:17,640
as you're going under
 

105
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,210
as you're going under
what happens is you get a little hit

106
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,220

 

107
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,250

only this much joke

108
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:28,260

 

109
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,550

so

110
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,560

 

111
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,210

incorrect

112
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,220

it all right to push his Center down

184
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,020
it all right to push his Center down
 

185
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,770
it all right to push his Center down
eventually I'm going to end up on top of
