00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
to flow the weakness is
 

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,910
to flow the weakness is
when we start to flow and enjoy it we

30
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
when we start to flow and enjoy it we
 

31
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,830
when we start to flow and enjoy it we
miss out certain points like

32
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
miss out certain points like
 

33
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,990
miss out certain points like
i just spoken about in the number 19

34
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000

 

35
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,470

and that is we miss out the power that

36
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
and that is we miss out the power that
 

37
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,189
and that is we miss out the power that
the block

38
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
the block
 

39
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,750
the block
requires okay so we end up with two

40
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
requires okay so we end up with two
 

41
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,950
requires okay so we end up with two
strikes but

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
strikes but
 

43
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,430
strikes but
uh no block in the middle and the block

44
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
uh no block in the middle and the block
 

45
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,430
uh no block in the middle and the block
is important

46
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
is important
 

47
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,710
is important
miggy nagari guys his skin

48
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720

 

49
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,590

earlier i was telling you about this

50
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
earlier i was telling you about this
 

51
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,310
earlier i was telling you about this
pushing

52
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
pushing
 

53
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,030
pushing
with the left you need a direction

54
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
with the left you need a direction
 

55
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,789
with the left you need a direction
so push it to the left like if it was a

56
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
so push it to the left like if it was a
 

57
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,429
so push it to the left like if it was a
clock

58
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
clock
 

59
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,030
clock
this is at 12 two o'clock ten o'clock

60
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
this is at 12 two o'clock ten o'clock
 

61
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,550
this is at 12 two o'clock ten o'clock
eleven one two so

62
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
eleven one two so
 

63
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,350
eleven one two so
push it to two o'clock but your hips

64
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
push it to two o'clock but your hips
 

65
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,990
push it to two o'clock but your hips
don't go

66
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
don't go
 

67
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,630
don't go
that way because you're gonna go that

68
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
that way because you're gonna go that
 

69
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,270
that way because you're gonna go that
way

70
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
way
 

71
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,830
way
so this would be a waste of going one

72
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
so this would be a waste of going one
 

73
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,030
so this would be a waste of going one
way to go the other

74
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
way to go the other
 

75
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,310
way to go the other
don't go backwards to go forwards so my

76
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
don't go backwards to go forwards so my
 

77
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,830
don't go backwards to go forwards so my
my hips come forwards even though my

78
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
my hips come forwards even though my
 

79
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,190
my hips come forwards even though my
hands go here

80
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200

 

81
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,950

but in meginagardi i'm going the other

82
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
but in meginagardi i'm going the other
 

83
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,429
but in meginagardi i'm going the other
side

84
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
side
 

85
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,030
side
so this time i push it

86
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
so this time i push it
 

87
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,310
so this time i push it
to the opposite i push it this way

88
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
to the opposite i push it this way
 

89
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,429
to the opposite i push it this way
don't push it forwards or else it'll

90
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
don't push it forwards or else it'll
 

91
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,710
don't push it forwards or else it'll
cramp up on your wrist don't make it a

92
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
cramp up on your wrist don't make it a
 

93
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,029
cramp up on your wrist don't make it a
big

big
 

95
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,589
big
sweep because then it's taking you that

96
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
sweep because then it's taking you that
 

97
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,150
sweep because then it's taking you that
way

98
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
way
 

99
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,030
way
you're going to strike showman but

100
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
you're going to strike showman but
 

101
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,869
you're going to strike showman but
you're going to

102
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
you're going to
 

103
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,270
you're going to
take it across so

104
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
take it across so
 

105
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:34,830
take it across so
this can go at 10 o'clock towards 11

106
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

107
00:02:34,840 --> 00:03:02,790

o'clock

108
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800

 

109
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,830

so build it up

110
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
so build it up
 

111
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,710
so build it up
with the steps

112
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720

 

113
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,710

10 o'clock the left hand

114
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720

 

115
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:29,110

the right hand stays in front of you

116
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120

 

117
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,030

get to this point i know i've stepped

118
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
get to this point i know i've stepped
 

119
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,309
get to this point i know i've stepped
forward

120
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
forward
 

121
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,309
forward
but this is all a part of building up

122
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
but this is all a part of building up
 

123
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,910
but this is all a part of building up
the timing

124
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920

 

125
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,309

now i'm going to put it together so by

132
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
now i'm going to put it together so by
 

133
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,350
now i'm going to put it together so by
timing so my foot and joe

134
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
timing so my foot and joe
 

135
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:26,830
timing so my foot and joe
end together

136
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840

 

137
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:40,310
