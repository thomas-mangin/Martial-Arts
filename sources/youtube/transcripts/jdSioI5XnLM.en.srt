1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,590

all right

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
all right
 

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,190
all right
so in the you need to know how to take

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
so in the you need to know how to take
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,030
so in the you need to know how to take
the Yan energy internalize it and go

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
the Yan energy internalize it and go
 

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,430
the Yan energy internalize it and go
down with

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
down with
 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,790
down with
it um let's think about it for a little

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800

 

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,070

bit this is more like an element of

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,080
bit this is more like an element of
 

13
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,230
bit this is more like an element of
CQ C is that once the energy comes in

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,240
CQ C is that once the energy comes in
 

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,310
CQ C is that once the energy comes in
then as it bouncing off the ground and

16
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
then as it bouncing off the ground and
 

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,150
then as it bouncing off the ground and
coming back and coming back up my body

18
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
coming back and coming back up my body
 

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,069
coming back and coming back up my body
okay that completes

20
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
okay that completes
 

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,869
okay that completes
CQ but I have to be able to stop taking

22
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
CQ but I have to be able to stop taking
 

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,389
CQ but I have to be able to stop taking
a

24
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
a
 

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,549
a
external uh

26
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
external uh
 

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,510
external uh
mechanical or a bracing

28
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
mechanical or a bracing
 

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,709
mechanical or a bracing
angle to make him look like he can't

30
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
angle to make him look like he can't
 

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,869
angle to make him look like he can't
push me over so my goal is not to not be

32
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:57,879
push me over so my goal is not to not be
 

33
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,830
push me over so my goal is not to not be
pushed over okay it's just is not being

34
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:00,840
pushed over okay it's just is not being
 

35
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,710
pushed over okay it's just is not being
pushed over is

36
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:03,720
pushed over is
 

37
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,550
pushed over is
indicative of that process of his y

38
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
indicative of that process of his y
 

39
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,190
indicative of that process of his y
energy coming in and being reoriented

40
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
energy coming in and being reoriented
 

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,950
energy coming in and being reoriented
downward okay got it okay so uh it's not

42
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:15,960
downward okay got it okay so uh it's not
 

43
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,550
downward okay got it okay so uh it's not
going to make me all powerful or

44
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:17,560
going to make me all powerful or
 

45
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,109
going to make me all powerful or
anything like that in in and of itself

46
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:20,119
anything like that in in and of itself
 

47
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,109
anything like that in in and of itself
but it leads to martial viability or

48
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
but it leads to martial viability or
 

49
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,429
but it leads to martial viability or
greater martial viability later okay so

50
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:26,439
greater martial viability later okay so
 

51
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,670
greater martial viability later okay so
we start out with our simple drill here

52
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
we start out with our simple drill here
 

53
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,550
we start out with our simple drill here
um we're looking

54
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:31,560
um we're looking
 

55
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,310
um we're looking
on his energy coming in and going down

56
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
on his energy coming in and going down
 

57
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,149
on his energy coming in and going down
the back foot okay that so the line that

58
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:39,159
the back foot okay that so the line that
 

59
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,550
the back foot okay that so the line that
I described to you energy coming in

60
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:41,560
I described to you energy coming in
 

61
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,109
I described to you energy coming in
instead of having it Vector out or stay

62
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
instead of having it Vector out or stay
 

63
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,830
instead of having it Vector out or stay
here at my wrist I'm going to have it go

64
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
here at my wrist I'm going to have it go
 

65
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,789
here at my wrist I'm going to have it go
in and have it press down

66
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
in and have it press down
 

67
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,190
in and have it press down
onto the back foot okay the front foot

68
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
onto the back foot okay the front foot
 

69
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,950
onto the back foot okay the front foot
is irrelevant there okay you got it you

70
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:57,960
is irrelevant there okay you got it you
 

71
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,910
is irrelevant there okay you got it you
guys understand so uh nobody could tell

72
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:00,920
guys understand so uh nobody could tell
 

73
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,550
guys understand so uh nobody could tell
like really how you're hard you're

74
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
like really how you're hard you're
 

75
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,069
like really how you're hard you're
pushing so go ahead and give it

76
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
pushing so go ahead and give it
 

77
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,190
pushing so go ahead and give it
something okay and this is the front

78
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
something okay and this is the front
 

79
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,910
something okay and this is the front
foot is irrelevant to what's happening

80
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
foot is irrelevant to what's happening
 

81
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,150
foot is irrelevant to what's happening
and I'm not leaning in any kind of

82
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
and I'm not leaning in any kind of
 

83
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,670
and I'm not leaning in any kind of
positive way here to have that bracing

84
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
positive way here to have that bracing
 

85
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,150
positive way here to have that bracing
in he's just making my back foot go

86
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
in he's just making my back foot go
 

87
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,030
in he's just making my back foot go
deeper and deeper into the ground

88
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,040
deeper and deeper into the ground
 

89
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,790
deeper and deeper into the ground
okay

90
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
okay
 

91
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,150
okay
so the problem

92
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,160
so the problem
 

93
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,229
so the problem
is doesn't this look like it

94
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:31,239
is doesn't this look like it
 

95
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,869
is doesn't this look like it
you see that doesn't that look like it

96
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:33,879
you see that doesn't that look like it
 

97
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,910
you see that doesn't that look like it
but if you pay attention where does it

98
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
but if you pay attention where does it
 

99
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,229
but if you pay attention where does it
not look like it Sean see if you can

100
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
not look like it Sean see if you can
 

101
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,430
not look like it Sean see if you can
come up and point to it or Taylor if you

102
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
come up and point to it or Taylor if you
 

103
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,190
come up and point to it or Taylor if you
want to say where or

104
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,200
want to say where or
 

105
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,869
want to say where or
Tristan what do you see your weight is

106
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
Tristan what do you see your weight is
 

107
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,309
Tristan what do you see your weight is
on the front foot okay so my knee angle

108
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
on the front foot okay so my knee angle
 

109
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,830
on the front foot okay so my knee angle
my knee angle is even with my toes you

110
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:52,840
my knee angle is even with my toes you
 

111
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,309
my knee angle is even with my toes you
see that and then my back leg what's the

112
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
see that and then my back leg what's the
 

113
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,830
see that and then my back leg what's the
knee articulation there it's kind of

114
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
knee articulation there it's kind of
 

115
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,869
knee articulation there it's kind of
it's straight on the other one it's bent

116
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
it's straight on the other one it's bent
 

117
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,830
it's straight on the other one it's bent
do you see it's bent you guys see that

118
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:08,840
do you see it's bent you guys see that
 

119
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,110
do you see it's bent you guys see that
okay so what you want to do is as you're

120
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,120
okay so what you want to do is as you're
 

121
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,509
okay so what you want to do is as you're
training you're not your goal is not to

122
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:14,519
training you're not your goal is not to
 

123
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,390
training you're not your goal is not to
stop him from pushing you over your goal

124
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,400
stop him from pushing you over your goal
 

125
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,430
stop him from pushing you over your goal
is to ground the back foot ground the

126
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:20,440
is to ground the back foot ground the
 

127
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,390
is to ground the back foot ground the
back foot okay that's your goal it

128
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
back foot okay that's your goal it
 

129
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,110
back foot okay that's your goal it
doesn't matter what you're doing with

130
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
doesn't matter what you're doing with
 

131
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,429
doesn't matter what you're doing with
your hands okay so for

132
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:28,439
your hands okay so for
 

133
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,350
your hands okay so for
example uh you know you like oh I'm I'm

134
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
example uh you know you like oh I'm I'm
 

135
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,149
example uh you know you like oh I'm I'm
trying to do leverage things on his

136
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:33,159
trying to do leverage things on his
 

137
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,390
trying to do leverage things on his
hands it it doesn't matter you're you're

138
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
hands it it doesn't matter you're you're
 

139
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,149
hands it it doesn't matter you're you're
grounding the back foot you're just

140
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
grounding the back foot you're just
 

141
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,309
grounding the back foot you're just
grounding the back foot the hands aren't

142
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
grounding the back foot the hands aren't
 

143
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,990
grounding the back foot the hands aren't
relevant okay and in fact the posture go

144
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,000
relevant okay and in fact the posture go
 

145
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,229
relevant okay and in fact the posture go
ahead keep pushing the posture is not

146
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239
ahead keep pushing the posture is not
 

147
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,149
ahead keep pushing the posture is not
relevant either once you understand

148
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:47,159
relevant either once you understand
 

149
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,309
relevant either once you understand
what's going on

150
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
what's going on
 

151
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,550
what's going on
okay but because the other one looks

152
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
okay but because the other one looks
 

153
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,509
okay but because the other one looks
similar and because you want to try to

154
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
similar and because you want to try to
 

155
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,869
similar and because you want to try to
stop him from pushing you over as as

156
00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879
stop him from pushing you over as as
 

157
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,830
stop him from pushing you over as as
opposed to use him to ground the back

158
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:02,840
opposed to use him to ground the back
 

159
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,069
opposed to use him to ground the back
foot it helps the beginner if you take

160
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,079
foot it helps the beginner if you take
 

161
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,550
foot it helps the beginner if you take
away things that allow you to confuse

162
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
away things that allow you to confuse
 

163
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,630
away things that allow you to confuse
the two for you so when I lift one

164
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
the two for you so when I lift one
 

165
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,150
the two for you so when I lift one
leg right you you you don't have the

166
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
leg right you you you don't have the
 

167
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,030
leg right you you you don't have the
bracing angle on the back leg because

168
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,040
bracing angle on the back leg because
 

169
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,830
bracing angle on the back leg because
you would fall

170
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
you would fall
 

171
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,830
you would fall
forward so you can also take away the

172
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
forward so you can also take away the
 

173
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,189
forward so you can also take away the
back leg

174
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:26,199
back leg
 

175
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,029
back leg
entirely you see so if I'm external he's

176
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:30,039
entirely you see so if I'm external he's
 

177
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,749
entirely you see so if I'm external he's
driving he's going to push you where you

178
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:32,759
driving he's going to push you where you
 

179
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,670
driving he's going to push you where you
have no basis

180
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
have no basis
 

181
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,029
have no basis
support when I went to one leg clearly

182
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:38,039
support when I went to one leg clearly
 

183
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,550
support when I went to one leg clearly
the base of support is not relevant here

184
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
the base of support is not relevant here
 

185
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,270
the base of support is not relevant here
it's not a matter of line gravity line

186
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
it's not a matter of line gravity line
 

187
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,230
it's not a matter of line gravity line
of gravity inside the base of support

188
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
of gravity inside the base of support
 

189
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,990
of gravity inside the base of support
nor there as I noted why why I was able

190
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
nor there as I noted why why I was able
 

191
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,029
nor there as I noted why why I was able
to change my posture you see it's not

192
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,039
to change my posture you see it's not
 

193
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,390
to change my posture you see it's not
relevant to it but

194
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:55,400
relevant to it but
 

195
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,629
relevant to it but
here I don't have that foot there to use

196
00:04:59,629 --> 00:04:59,639
here I don't have that foot there to use
 

197
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,230
here I don't have that foot there to use
but it's not as hard as one foot you see

198
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,240
but it's not as hard as one foot you see
 

199
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,990
but it's not as hard as one foot you see
so he's pushing and I'm just grounding

200
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,000
so he's pushing and I'm just grounding
 

201
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,469
so he's pushing and I'm just grounding
at same he's making both feet heavy and

202
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
at same he's making both feet heavy and
 

203
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,909
at same he's making both feet heavy and
again don't try to find leverage or

204
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:12,919
again don't try to find leverage or
 

205
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,270
again don't try to find leverage or
anything you're just here grounding

206
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,280
anything you're just here grounding
 

207
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,830
anything you're just here grounding
grounding okay and again if he lets go

208
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:18,840
grounding okay and again if he lets go
 

209
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,230
grounding okay and again if he lets go
really fast I don't go flying forward

210
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
really fast I don't go flying forward
 

211
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,990
really fast I don't go flying forward
because I wasn't doing this stuff you

212
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
because I wasn't doing this stuff you
 

213
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,629
because I wasn't doing this stuff you
see he lets go really fast and that's

214
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
see he lets go really fast and that's
 

215
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,070
see he lets go really fast and that's
not what I was doing

216
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
not what I was doing
 

217
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,350
not what I was doing
okay so let's try with two legs cuz one

218
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,360
okay so let's try with two legs cuz one
 

219
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,070
okay so let's try with two legs cuz one
front foot back foot it's too

220
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,080
front foot back foot it's too
 

221
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,950
front foot back foot it's too
easy to deceive ourselves with okay so

222
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
easy to deceive ourselves with okay so
 

223
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,070
easy to deceive ourselves with okay so
two legs out no possible bracing angle

224
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
two legs out no possible bracing angle
 

225
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,840
two legs out no possible bracing angle
okay let's try
