that will actually kind of help me when
 

73
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,969
that will actually kind of help me when
there's two people one of the problems

74
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:25,979
there's two people one of the problems
 

75
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:26,780
there's two people one of the problems
is that I want to create much

76
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:26,790
is that I want to create much
 

77
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,310
is that I want to create much
interference with these two as I

78
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
interference with these two as I
 

79
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,749
interference with these two as I
possibly can so when there's two people

80
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
possibly can so when there's two people
 

81
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,490
possibly can so when there's two people
on me I want to knock them against each

82
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,500
on me I want to knock them against each
 

83
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,789
on me I want to knock them against each
other

84
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:31,799
other
 

85
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,230
other
the main problem I'm gonna have is I

86
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,240
the main problem I'm gonna have is I
 

87
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
the main problem I'm gonna have is I
have twice as much force right so that's

88
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:34,650
have twice as much force right so that's
 

89
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,560
have twice as much force right so that's
a pretty big main problem how am I gonna

90
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:36,570
a pretty big main problem how am I gonna
 

91
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,569
a pretty big main problem how am I gonna
deal with that so let's say these two

92
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:38,579
deal with that so let's say these two

started to get some motion going the
 

151
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,619
started to get some motion going the
last thing I want is to be stagnated in

152

this position because these two are

154
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:30,519
this position because these two are
 

155
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,830
this position because these two are
stronger than me so they're gonna

156
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
stronger than me so they're gonna
 

157
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,899
stronger than me so they're gonna
overcome me so the first thing I have to

158

overcome me so the first thing I have to
 

159
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,580
overcome me so the first thing I have to
do is figure out what sides pulling

160
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,590
do is figure out what sides pulling
 

161
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,229
do is figure out what sides pulling
harder and then go with that so that

162
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:37,239
harder and then go with that so that
 

163
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,030
harder and then go with that so that
simple so if Josh is pulling harder I'd

164
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
simple so if Josh is pulling harder I'd
 

165
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,740
simple so if Josh is pulling harder I'd
go with here and Josh and I strength

166
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:40,750
go with here and Josh and I strength
 

167
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,629
go with here and Josh and I strength
combined with pullaiah which is great so

168
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:42,639
combined with pullaiah which is great so
 

169
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,759
combined with pullaiah which is great so
even if mine was a big beast Josh and I

170
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:44,769
even if mine was a big beast Josh and I
 

171
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,129
even if mine was a big beast Josh and I
together could probably pull her now the

172
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:47,139
together could probably pull her now the
 

173
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,289
together could probably pull her now the
second I pulled those guys together I

174
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:49,299
second I pulled those guys together I
 

175
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,670
second I pulled those guys together I
want to get out of the area of

176
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:50,680
want to get out of the area of
 

177
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,559
want to get out of the area of
contention so right now I'm right smack

178
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:52,569
contention so right now I'm right smack
 

179
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,179
contention so right now I'm right smack
dab the air and contingent if you look

180
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:54,189
dab the air and contingent if you look
 

181
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:55,979
dab the air and contingent if you look
at our positioning this is a trap it's a

182
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:55,989
at our positioning this is a trap it's a
 

183
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,599
at our positioning this is a trap it's a
terrible position so what I'm gonna try

184
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:57,609
terrible position so what I'm gonna try
 

185
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,459
terrible position so what I'm gonna try
and do is use food and wash you to slide

186
00:02:59,459 --> 00:02:59,469
and do is use food and wash you to slide
 

187
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:01,259
and do is use food and wash you to slide
out of this so once I pull here I'm

188
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:01,269
out of this so once I pull here I'm
 

189
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,879
out of this so once I pull here I'm
gonna try and get those two into each

190
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:02,889
gonna try and get those two into each
 

191
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,080
gonna try and get those two into each
other and that's what I'm looking for

192
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,090
other and that's what I'm looking for
 

193
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,119
other and that's what I'm looking for
now look that looks pretty iq2 stuff it

194
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,129
now look that looks pretty iq2 stuff it
 

195
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,890
now look that looks pretty iq2 stuff it
might not turn out that beautiful but

196
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:07,900
might not turn out that beautiful but
 

197
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,449
might not turn out that beautiful but
that's the main idea of what I'm looking

198
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:09,459
that's the main idea of what I'm looking
 

199
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,039
that's the main idea of what I'm looking
for I want to smash them against each

200
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,049
for I want to smash them against each
 

201
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,300
for I want to smash them against each
other as hard as I can and that

202
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,310
other as hard as I can and that
 

203
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,649
other as hard as I can and that
hopefully gives me a little bit of

204
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:13,659
hopefully gives me a little bit of
 

205
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,159
hopefully gives me a little bit of
breathing room

206
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,169
breathing room
 

207
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,750
breathing room
they might not both let go but maybe

208
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
they might not both let go but maybe
 

209
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,129
they might not both let go but maybe
what I'm gonna let go and one will

210
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:17,139
what I'm gonna let go and one will
 

211
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,140
what I'm gonna let go and one will
change positions or all kinds of things

212
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,150
change positions or all kinds of things
 

213
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,640
change positions or all kinds of things
can happen but that's the main idea of

214
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,650
can happen but that's the main idea of
 

215
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,500
can happen but that's the main idea of
what I'm looking for so here I'm gonna

216
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,510
what I'm looking for so here I'm gonna
 

217
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,719
what I'm looking for so here I'm gonna
decide which sides pulling harder and

218
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:24,729
decide which sides pulling harder and
 

219
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,219
decide which sides pulling harder and
then can I get out of the area of

220
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:26,229
then can I get out of the area of
 

221
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,750
then can I get out of the area of
contention so right now neither of them

222
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
contention so right now neither of them
 

223
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,309
contention so right now neither of them
slowing large that's fine with me too

224
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:29,319
slowing large that's fine with me too

each other and get out of the way of
 

259
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,719
each other and get out of the way of

pushing them against each other and

276
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,289
pushing them against each other and
 

277
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,930
pushing them against each other and
twisting them up so it's very similar to

278
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:18,940
twisting them up so it's very similar to
 

279
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,610
twisting them up so it's very similar to
working with Rio casa

280
