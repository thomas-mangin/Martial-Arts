243
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,540
and to pivot my feet and what you're
doing instead is your center of gravity

244
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:14,550
doing instead is your center of gravity
 

245
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,980
doing instead is your center of gravity
is coming behind the posted foot here so

246
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:18,990
is coming behind the posted foot here so
 

247
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,160
is coming behind the posted foot here so
you go here you see that I supposed to

248
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,170
you go here you see that I supposed to
 

249
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,829
you go here you see that I supposed to
stay over the posted foot I'm on the

250
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:24,839
stay over the posted foot I'm on the
 

251
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,390
stay over the posted foot I'm on the
posted foot there's no weight on this

252
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,400
posted foot there's no weight on this
 

253
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,390
posted foot there's no weight on this
foot okay and I'm turning on the posted

254
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:29,400
foot okay and I'm turning on the posted
 

255
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,079
foot okay and I'm turning on the posted
foot yeah

256
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:32,089
foot yeah
 

257
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,920
foot yeah
so you're here and then you wait shift

258
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:36,930
so you're here and then you wait shift
 

259
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,470
so you're here and then you wait shift
to the back so that you can move this

260
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,480
to the back so that you can move this
 

261
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,260
to the back so that you can move this
leg

262
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,270
leg
 

263
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,090
leg
and then that's what causes this

264
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,100
and then that's what causes this
 

265
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,310
and then that's what causes this
separation on center but when you go

266
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:45,320
separation on center but when you go
 

267
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,830
separation on center but when you go
like that it started to move right and

268
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:47,840

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,860
outside as opposed to ground ground
above this foot when I turn I'm turning

274
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:56,870
above this foot when I turn I'm turning
 

275
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,960
above this foot when I turn I'm turning
you see the weight shift I turn on it

276
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:58,970
you see the weight shift I turn on it
 

277
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,930
you see the weight shift I turn on it
this foot is now not doing anything but

278
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:01,940
this foot is now not doing anything but
 

279
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,690
this foot is now not doing anything but
moving and I pivot on the ruby foot okay

280
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:07,700
moving and I pivot on the ruby foot okay
 

281
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,400
moving and I pivot on the ruby foot okay
so it might just be here and then root

282
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,410
so it might just be here and then root
 

283
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:25,390
so it might just be here and then root
and that's all I need I'm not going to

284
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,400
and that's all I need I'm not going to
 

285
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:36,610
and that's all I need I'm not going to
move it away the first move is yeah
