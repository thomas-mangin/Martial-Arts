do over there

184
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599

technique that's how you go it's got so
many variations

190
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560

 

191
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,830

and the better you get the smoother it

192
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:28,840
and the better you get the smoother it
 

193
