00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,070

A technical and progressive explanation

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
A technical and progressive explanation
 

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,430
A technical and progressive explanation
of the study of movement. We'll start

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,440
of the study of movement. We'll start
 

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,870
of the study of movement. We'll start
with a truly comprehensive technique. This

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
with a truly comprehensive technique. This
 

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,870
with a truly comprehensive technique. This
technique isn't necessarily intended to

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:13,880
technique isn't necessarily intended to
 

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,390
technique isn't necessarily intended to
have a martial or other explanation;

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
have a martial or other explanation;
 

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,310
have a martial or other explanation;
it allows us to work on

12
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
it allows us to work on
 

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,710
it allows us to work on
different technical points and solutions

14
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
different technical points and solutions
 

15
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,429
different technical points and solutions
in response to a

16
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
in response to a
 

17
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,470
in response to a
challenge. One of the kochinags we can

18
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
challenge. One of the kochinags we can
 

19
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,950
challenge. One of the kochinags we can
work on is a kochinag that

20
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
work on is a kochinag that
 

21
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,589
work on is a kochinag that
allows us to enter directly and,

22
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
allows us to enter directly and,
 

23
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,750
allows us to enter directly and,
from there, to throw the opponent.

24
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
from there, to throw the opponent.
 

25
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,030
from there, to throw the opponent.
So its aspect will be interesting in

26
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
So its aspect will be interesting in
 

27
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,830
So its aspect will be interesting in
relation to the angle

28
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
relation to the angle
 

29
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,190
relation to the angle
of entry. Many people will say, "

30
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
of entry. Many people will say, "
 

31
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,750
of entry. Many people will say, "
Yes, if they release, what happens?" and so on.

32
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
Yes, if they release, what happens?" and so on.
 

33
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,869
Yes, if they release, what happens?" and so on.
And we'll enter the study of the

34
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
And we'll enter the study of the
 

35
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,350
And we'll enter the study of the
essi, which is an interesting study

36
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
essi, which is an interesting study
 

37
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,510
essi, which is an interesting study
from the moment the practitioner

38
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
from the moment the practitioner
 

39
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,950
from the moment the practitioner
has acquired enough technique to

40
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:55,960
has acquired enough technique to
 

41
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,150
has acquired enough technique to
be able to work on the movement and

42
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
be able to work on the movement and
 

43
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,830
be able to work on the movement and
not just on the technique itself.

44
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:00,840
not just on the technique itself.
 

45
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,910
not just on the technique itself.
So, from the moment

46
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
So, from the moment
 

47
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,510
So, from the moment
I enter, I've worked on my

48
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
I enter, I've worked on my
 

49
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,270
I enter, I've worked on my
different technical points, and

50
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
different technical points, and
 

51
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,749
different technical points, and
now, if they release from this

52
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:12,759
now, if they release from this
 

53
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,310
now, if they release from this
movement, I can continue.

54
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320

 

55
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,230

And a second technique,

56
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
And a second technique,
 

57
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,270
And a second technique,
Viord, we'll position ourselves at this angle. The

58
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
Viord, we'll position ourselves at this angle. The
 

59
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,910
Viord, we'll position ourselves at this angle. The
movement I started, Avein,

60
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
movement I started, Avein,
 

61
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,830
movement I started, Avein,
will continue

62
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
will continue
 

63
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,910
will continue
here with a variation of the

64
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
here with a variation of the
 

65
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,590
here with a variation of the
C of prayer technique. You'll

66
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
C of prayer technique. You'll
 

67
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,830
C of prayer technique. You'll
work on the movement to be able to

68
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:46,840
work on the movement to be able to
 

69
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,910
work on the movement to be able to
use another technique.  You

70
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:48,920
use another technique.  You
 

71
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,069
use another technique.  You
have already

72
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
have already
 

73
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,389
have already
studied, and if you are not at a distance to

74
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:53,399
studied, and if you are not at a distance to
 

75
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,630
studied, and if you are not at a distance to
return, and if you don't have contact,

76
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,640
return, and if you don't have contact,
 

77
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,350
return, and if you don't have contact,
we will continue

78
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
we will continue
 

79
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,389
we will continue
from there. We will position ourselves

80
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
from there. We will position ourselves
 

81
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,310
from there. We will position ourselves
at this angle,

82
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
at this angle,
 

83
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,430
at this angle,
and if I pass kochinag, it releases. And

84
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,440
and if I pass kochinag, it releases. And
 

85
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,390
and if I pass kochinag, it releases. And
if I am not at a distance to make

86
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
if I am not at a distance to make
 

87
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,350
if I am not at a distance to make
contact here, then I will be able to

88
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:14,360
contact here, then I will be able to
 

89
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,070
contact here, then I will be able to
continue my movement and

90
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
continue my movement and
 

91
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,750
continue my movement and
continue. The study of progression

92
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:22,760
continue. The study of progression
 

93
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,030
continue. The study of progression
will move from a technical study of

94
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
will move from a technical study of
 

95
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,150
will move from a technical study of
moroteori and

96
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160

 

97
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,910

kochinag. You will be able to

98
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920

 

99
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,070

study one kochinag among others on

100
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,080
study one kochinag among others on
 

101
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,589
study one kochinag among others on
the moroteori stimulus,

102
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
the moroteori stimulus,
 

103
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,070
the moroteori stimulus,
or use different techniques to

104
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
or use different techniques to
 

105
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,190
or use different techniques to
study the movement. And then, from

106
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
study the movement. And then, from
 

107
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,470
study the movement. And then, from
there, I initiate my movement; it could

108
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:49,480
there, I initiate my movement; it could
 

109
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,710
there, I initiate my movement; it could
release me at any

110
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:51,720
release me at any
 

111
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,190
release me at any
moment, but I will continue my

112
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
moment, but I will continue my
 

113
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,750
moment, but I will continue my
movement. And of course, the choice of

114
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
movement. And of course, the choice of
 

115
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,390
movement. And of course, the choice of
these three techniques

116
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
these three techniques
 

117
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,509
these three techniques
is only three among many others.

118
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519
is only three among many others.
 

119
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,110
is only three among many others.
You could use or call upon

120
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
You could use or call upon
 

121
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,589
You could use or call upon
numerous techniques from your

122
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:06,599
numerous techniques from your
 

123
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,670
numerous techniques from your
repertoire and your knowledge. Hence

124
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:08,680
repertoire and your knowledge. Hence
 

125
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,270
repertoire and your knowledge. Hence
the importance of starting the first

126
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,280
the importance of starting the first
 

127
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,710
the importance of starting the first
step by learning many

128
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
step by learning many
 

129
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,229
step by learning many
techniques and then linking them to

130
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,239
techniques and then linking them to
 

131
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,799
techniques and then linking them to
the study of movement.
