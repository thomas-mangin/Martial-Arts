it so uh there were many different arts

82
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
it so uh there were many different arts
 

83
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,630

early early early chinese thought and
 

121
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,110
early early early chinese thought and
in particular the idea that there is

122
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
in particular the idea that there is
 

123
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,110
in particular the idea that there is
a kind of identifiable

124
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
a kind of identifiable
 

125
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,350

127
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,589
nature
things in alignment

128
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
things in alignment
 

129
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,589
things in alignment
with that nature

130
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
with that nature
 

131
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,710
with that nature
are better than things out of alignment

132
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
are better than things out of alignment
 

133
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,350
are better than things out of alignment
with that nature okay so your jujitsu

134
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
with that nature okay so your jujitsu
 

135
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,070
with that nature okay so your jujitsu
shares this genealogy

136
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
shares this genealogy
 

137
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,190
shares this genealogy
and therefore it's going to use

138
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
and therefore it's going to use
 

139
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,869
and therefore it's going to use
natural movements

140
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
natural movements
 

141
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,790
natural movements
not unnatural movements so it's going to

142
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
not unnatural movements so it's going to
 

143
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,630
not unnatural movements so it's going to
um

144
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
um
 

145
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,990
um

do you see

294
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
do you see
 

295
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,990

um
so

298
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
so
 

299
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,150
so
i'm doing it

300
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160

 

301
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,710

incorrectly not in accordance with this

302
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
incorrectly not in accordance with this
 

303
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,110
incorrectly not in accordance with this
natural way do you see that okay

304
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
natural way do you see that okay
 

305
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,790
natural way do you see that okay
so oh there's only so many reasons why

306
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
so oh there's only so many reasons why
 

307
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,469
so oh there's only so many reasons why
okay but they all come to the same place

308
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
okay but they all come to the same place
 

309
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,790
okay but they all come to the same place
all right so as i watch

310
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
all right so as i watch
 

311
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,390
all right so as i watch
your technique and all of your

312
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400

techniques
um

316
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
um
 

317
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,790
um
it's very key to

318
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
it's very key to
 

319
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,110
it's very key to
the tension that you're feeling

320
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
the tension that you're feeling
 

321
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,990
the tension that you're feeling
in other words why can't i do an

322
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
in other words why can't i do an
 

323
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,950
in other words why can't i do an
unnatural movement

324
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
unnatural movement
 

325
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,350
unnatural movement
without the tension

326
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
without the tension
 

327
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,350
without the tension
it's always there

328
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
it's always there
 

329
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,150
it's always there
do you see that it is it is

330
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
do you see that it is it is
 

331
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,790
do you see that it is it is
physiologically possible to do an

332
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
physiologically possible to do an
 

333
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,909
physiologically possible to do an
unnatural movement without the tension

334
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
unnatural movement without the tension
 

335
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,990
unnatural movement without the tension
but we never do

336
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
but we never do
 

337
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,350
but we never do
do you see that so

338
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
do you see that so
 

339
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,670
do you see that so
what we tend to think is

340
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
what we tend to think is
 

341
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,670
what we tend to think is
uh we put the we answer the the horse

342
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
uh we put the we answer the the horse
 

343
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,950
uh we put the we answer the the horse
and the cart riddle incorrectly you see

344
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
and the cart riddle incorrectly you see
 

345
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,430
and the cart riddle incorrectly you see
it's because you're tense

346
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
it's because you're tense
 

347
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,909
it's because you're tense
and you can't do a natural movement you

348
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
and you can't do a natural movement you
 

349
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,430
and you can't do a natural movement you
your tension

350
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
your tension
 

351

it's not
 

489
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,030
it's not
constantly existing it manifests in

490
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
constantly existing it manifests in
 

491
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,509
constantly existing it manifests in
response to certain things

492
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
response to certain things
 

493
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,150

you can track where it is if where is
genesis rest

498
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
genesis rest
 

499
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,910
genesis rest
okay and so here you are

500
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
okay and so here you are
 

501
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,350
okay and so here you are
and uh you you it doesn't take

502
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
and uh you you it doesn't take
 

503
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,310
and uh you you it doesn't take
a genius to figure out what is going on

right so depending on who's doing it
 

507
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,150
right so depending on who's doing it
um

508
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
um
 

509
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,910
um
you can find

510
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
you can find
 

511
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,069
you can find
common

512
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
common
 

513
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,150
common
points of anxiousness

514
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
points of anxiousness
 

515
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,030
points of anxiousness
okay

516
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
okay
 

517
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,310
okay

do you see
 

523
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,630
do you see
it might be the same gender because you

524
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
it might be the same gender because you
 

525
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,870
it might be the same gender because you

okay
it

838
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
it
 

839
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,430
it
goes deeper the problem is deeper which

840
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
goes deeper the problem is deeper which
 

841
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,430
goes deeper the problem is deeper which
is precisely why

842
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
is precisely why
 

843
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,270
is precisely why
a martial art can be an equivalent to
