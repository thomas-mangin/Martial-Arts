do the farm right

210
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039

 

211
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,610

so that pause you see oh that's that's

212
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:49,620
so that pause you see oh that's that's
 

213
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,830
so that pause you see oh that's that's
what we're losing okay you want you want

you want to lose that
so I

218
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,100

 

219
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,590

have to continue

220
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:00,600
have to continue

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,230

it looks like it's picked from the start

222
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,240
it looks like it's picked from the start
 

223
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,550
it looks like it's picked from the start
okay uh but as we're going along you see

224
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,560
okay uh but as we're going along you see
 

225
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,790
okay uh but as we're going along you see
that he doing something different if you

226
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
that he doing something different if you
 

227
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,189
that he doing something different if you
stay there okay so in this one his

228
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
stay there okay so in this one his
 

229
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,170
stay there okay so in this one his
uh stand up try to remember where you

230
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,180
uh stand up try to remember where you
 

231
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,969
uh stand up try to remember where you
are you're kind of crunched you see but

232
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:19,979
are you're kind of crunched you see but
 

233
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,730
are you're kind of crunched you see but
okay and you broke Center okay on the

234
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:22,740
okay and you broke Center okay on the
 

235
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,689
okay and you broke Center okay on the
last one he had his Center the leg was

236
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:26,699
last one he had his Center the leg was
 

237
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,330
last one he had his Center the leg was
up do you think do you get it and so now

238
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:29,340
up do you think do you get it and so now
 

239
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,909
up do you think do you get it and so now
now he can turn on that but when his

240
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
now he can turn on that but when his
 

241
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,730
now he can turn on that but when his
when he broke Center and he crunched

242
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,740
when he broke Center and he crunched
 

243
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,950
when he broke Center and he crunched
do you think he can't he's not going to

244
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
do you think he can't he's not going to
 

245
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,350
do you think he can't he's not going to
turn on that do you see that so the

246
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
turn on that do you see that so the
 

247
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,930
turn on that do you see that so the
angle's over here now I have to move to

248
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:41,940
angle's over here now I have to move to
 

249
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,230
angle's over here now I have to move to
generate the angle

250
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,240

 

251
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,129

yeah well there's that easy that was the

252
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:49,139
yeah well there's that easy that was the
 

253
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,490
yeah well there's that easy that was the
first one so if he if he does that

254
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,500
first one so if he if he does that
 

255
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,249
first one so if he if he does that
reaction there he didn't so he came back

256
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:55,259
reaction there he didn't so he came back
 

257
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,150
reaction there he didn't so he came back
around this way

258
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,160

 

259
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:15,290

so it looks like his same thing

260
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,300

 

261
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,089

hey would you try to do that right here

262
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,099
hey would you try to do that right here
 

263
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,550
hey would you try to do that right here
he's coming around this like but at

264
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,560
he's coming around this like but at
 

265
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,369
he's coming around this like but at
least he's coming in at me

266
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:22,379
least he's coming in at me
 

267
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,909
least he's coming in at me
so we take it the other way

268
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
so we take it the other way
 

269
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,129
so we take it the other way
but it looks like it's seamless because

270
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:28,139
but it looks like it's seamless because
 

271
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,089
but it looks like it's seamless because
I

272
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:29,099
I
 

273
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,190
I
don't know

274
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,200

 

275
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:52,800

so you don't see the parts

276
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:52,810

there's that crunch again there's no

280
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:00,779
there's that crunch again there's no
 

281
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,350
there's that crunch again there's no
there's no technique here that you guys

282
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
there's no technique here that you guys
 

283
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,670
there's no technique here that you guys
want to try

284
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,680
want to try
 

285
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,030
want to try
because he's so crunchy crunched up and

286
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,040
because he's so crunchy crunched up and
 

287
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,389
because he's so crunchy crunched up and
he's coming at me do you see but a yield

288
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:11,399
he's coming at me do you see but a yield
 

289
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,210
he's coming at me do you see but a yield
and then it's right here when it happens
