00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:47,960
actually there's quite a bit to
 

251
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,260
actually there's quite a bit to
unpacking here because first I guess the

252
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,270
unpacking here because first I guess the
 

253
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,189
unpacking here because first I guess the
answer that the question is you can see

254
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199
answer that the question is you can see
 

255
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,629
answer that the question is you can see
it both ways in terms of the Harmonia

256
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:55,639
it both ways in terms of the Harmonia
 

257
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,719
it both ways in terms of the Harmonia
Aikido in terms of Aikido being I think

258
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:58,729
Aikido in terms of Aikido being I think
 

259
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,820
Aikido in terms of Aikido being I think
by design something that's supposed to

260
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:00,830
by design something that's supposed to
 

261
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,390
by design something that's supposed to
be open to many interpretations yeah so

262
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
be open to many interpretations yeah so
 

263
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,240
be open to many interpretations yeah so
in this sense perhaps it makes sense

264
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,250
in this sense perhaps it makes sense
 

265
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,469
in this sense perhaps it makes sense
that everybody does their little thing

266
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
that everybody does their little thing
 

267
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,080
that everybody does their little thing
in you know in their own corner but of

268
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,090
in you know in their own corner but of
 

269
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,730
in you know in their own corner but of
course if you think about Aikido in

270
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:12,740
course if you think about Aikido in
 

271
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,409
course if you think about Aikido in
terms of something joining energies and

272
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:14,419
terms of something joining energies and
 

273
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,679
terms of something joining energies and
so on then it makes sense to unify them

274
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:16,689
so on then it makes sense to unify them
 

275
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,119
so on then it makes sense to unify them
and I always wonder what's really the

276
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:21,129
and I always wonder what's really the
 

277
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,699
and I always wonder what's really the
best for the for perhaps s for the

278
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:23,709
best for the for perhaps s for the
 

279
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,589
best for the for perhaps s for the
discipline itself but for the

280
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:25,599
discipline itself but for the
 

281
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,819
discipline itself but for the
practitioners is do everybody doing

282
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:29,829
practitioners is do everybody doing
 

283
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,919
practitioners is do everybody doing
their own thing you know by themselves

284
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:31,929
their own thing you know by themselves
 

285
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:32,549
their own thing you know by themselves
and so on

286
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:32,559
and so on
 

287
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,369
and so on
Oh gathering because if you gather those

288
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:35,379
Oh gathering because if you gather those
 

289
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,469
Oh gathering because if you gather those
people I guess the number of question

290
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:37,479
people I guess the number of question
 

291
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,109
people I guess the number of question
that going to be a rising such as do you

292
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:40,119
that going to be a rising such as do you

something happening no but you know I
 

299
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,739
something happening no but you know I
think for me it was like the same when

300
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:52,749
think for me it was like the same when
 

301
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,109
think for me it was like the same when
you watch the development of a country

302
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:55,119
you watch the development of a country
 

303
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:58,829
you watch the development of a country
for instance an old days you had cleanse

304
00:06:58,829 --> 00:06:58,839
for instance an old days you had cleanse
 

305
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,109
for instance an old days you had cleanse
and every clan had a fleck and f-words

and every clan had a fleck and f-words
 

307
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,779
and every clan had a fleck and f-words
very happy to have his own flag and but

308
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:03,789
very happy to have his own flag and but
 

309
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,249
very happy to have his own flag and but
cleanse are doing they fight each other

310
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:05,259
cleanse are doing they fight each other
 

311
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,519
cleanse are doing they fight each other
right and one day somebody says let's

312
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:08,529
right and one day somebody says let's
 

313
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,489
right and one day somebody says let's
make a nation right and you unite all

314
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:11,499
make a nation right and you unite all
 

315
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,029
make a nation right and you unite all
the clans to a nation so in Aikido it

316
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
the clans to a nation so in Aikido it
 

317
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,189
the clans to a nation so in Aikido it
requires and such maturity to quit to

318
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
requires and such maturity to quit to
 

319
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,809
