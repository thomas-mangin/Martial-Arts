00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
um i feel like there's kind of a
 

13
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,470
um i feel like there's kind of a
nonsense factory that just kind of

14
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
nonsense factory that just kind of
 

15
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,790
nonsense factory that just kind of
produces nonsense about this

16
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
produces nonsense about this
 

17
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,830
produces nonsense about this
unendingly and there is no escape from

18
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
unendingly and there is no escape from
 

19
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,029
unendingly and there is no escape from
it um that being said i believe there is

20
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
it um that being said i believe there is
 

21
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,870
it um that being said i believe there is
something that's being pointed out with

00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
something that's being pointed out with
 

23
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,550
something that's being pointed out with
internal power and i think there are

24
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
internal power and i think there are
 

25
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,230
internal power and i think there are
some legitimate teachers who say they

26
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
some legitimate teachers who say they
 

27
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,109
some legitimate teachers who say they
teach internal power or internal things

28
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
teach internal power or internal things
 

29
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,510
teach internal power or internal things
and and they're legitimately describing

and and they're legitimately describing
 

31
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,750
and and they're legitimately describing
some real stuff that's happening however

32
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
some real stuff that's happening however
 

33
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,350
some real stuff that's happening however
there are demonstrations of these things

34
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
there are demonstrations of these things
 

35
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,270
there are demonstrations of these things
that are so fantastical that a lot of

36
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
that are so fantastical that a lot of
 

37
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,229
that are so fantastical that a lot of
times people equate internal power with

38
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
times people equate internal power with
 

39
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,229
times people equate internal power with
magic power there's also kind of

40
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
magic power there's also kind of
 

41
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,549
magic power there's also kind of
confusion whether internal power is

42
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
confusion whether internal power is
 

43
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,869
confusion whether internal power is
spiritual stuff or internal power is a

all kinds of stuff around this
 

51
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,590
all kinds of stuff around this
i also want to separate saying internal

52
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
i also want to separate saying internal
 

53
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,389
i also want to separate saying internal
power from um internal chinese martial

54
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
power from um internal chinese martial
 

55
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,390
power from um internal chinese martial
arts i believe there's a distinction

56
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400

57
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,990

between those two things internal

58
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
between those two things internal
 

59
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,910
between those two things internal
chinese martial arts is a

60
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
chinese martial arts is a
 

61
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,830
chinese martial arts is a
valid section of martial arts to be

62
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
valid section of martial arts to be
 

63
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,149
valid section of martial arts to be
studied i've studied them with an expert

64
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
studied i've studied them with an expert
 

65
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,230
studied i've studied them with an expert
in internal chinese martial arts and

66
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
in internal chinese martial arts and
 

67
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,550
in internal chinese martial arts and
then there's what's the other extreme

68
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
then there's what's the other extreme
 

69
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,230
then there's what's the other extreme
side of that is people who study uh

70
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,240
side of that is people who study uh
 

71
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,390
side of that is people who study uh
ipitis right so internal power internal

72
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
ipitis right so internal power internal
 

73
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,149

strength internal training

74
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
strength internal training
 

75
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,230
strength internal training
and when you see uh that kind of stuff a

76
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
and when you see uh that kind of stuff a
 

77
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,910
and when you see uh that kind of stuff a
lot of times those guys it's not that

78
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
lot of times those guys it's not that
 

79
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,910
lot of times those guys it's not that
they're

80
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
they're
 

81
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,069
they're
i think there are some more devious

82
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
i think there are some more devious
 

83
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,190
i think there are some more devious
versions of that and i think there's

84
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
versions of that and i think there's
 

85
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,950
versions of that and i think there's
some less devious versions of that but

86
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
some less devious versions of that but
 

87
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,550
some less devious versions of that but
basically there are some things that

88
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
basically there are some things that
 

89
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,789
basically there are some things that
they do that can seem very impressive

90
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
they do that can seem very impressive
 

91
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,469
they do that can seem very impressive
i'm going to show you a series of these

92
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
i'm going to show you a series of these
 

93
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,069
i'm going to show you a series of these
demonstrations

94
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
demonstrations
 

95
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,069
demonstrations
and

96
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
and
 

97
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,670
and
when seen through the wrong lens can be

98
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
when seen through the wrong lens can be
 

99
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,109
when seen through the wrong lens can be
misconstrued as something that they are

100
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
misconstrued as something that they are
 

101
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,109
misconstrued as something that they are
not they are basically just ways to be

102
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
not they are basically just ways to be
 

103
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,429
not they are basically just ways to be
efficient and efficient uses of the body

104
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
efficient and efficient uses of the body
 

105
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,670
efficient and efficient uses of the body
they are available to anyone in fact you

106
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
they are available to anyone in fact you
 

107
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,429
they are available to anyone in fact you
use them all the time you just don't

108
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
use them all the time you just don't
 

109
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,270
use them all the time you just don't
know it anything that you do right and

110
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
know it anything that you do right and
 

111
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,709
know it anything that you do right and
efficiently you probably use some

112
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
efficiently you probably use some
 

113
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,350
efficiently you probably use some
internal power principles when doing it

114
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
internal power principles when doing it
 

115
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,630
internal power principles when doing it
but then there's a lot of people who

116
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
but then there's a lot of people who
 

117
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,230
but then there's a lot of people who
like to say oh only certain people who

magic secret thing is
that's the only way you're going to get

130
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
that's the only way you're going to get
 

131

that's the only way you're going to get
it so

132
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
it so
 

133
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,750
it so
i'm going to get josh out here we're

134
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
i'm going to get josh out here we're
 

135
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,190
i'm going to get josh out here we're
going to go over a few things i'm going

136
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
going to go over a few things i'm going
 

137
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,550
going to go over a few things i'm going
to break this up into sections because

138
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
to break this up into sections because
 

139
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,589
to break this up into sections because
there's several sections i think you

140
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
there's several sections i think you
 

141
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,949
there's several sections i think you
need to understand

142
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
need to understand
 

143
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,350
need to understand
this is a organization i made for myself

144
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
this is a organization i made for myself
 

145
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,110
this is a organization i made for myself
when i was trying to

146
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
when i was trying to
 

147
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,790
when i was trying to
debunk a lot of this stuff and i was

148
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
debunk a lot of this stuff and i was
 

149
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,990
debunk a lot of this stuff and i was
kind of going through and saying like

150
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
kind of going through and saying like
 

151
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,910
kind of going through and saying like
well that's just this this is just this

152
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
well that's just this this is just this
 

153
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,430
well that's just this this is just this
and i realized that there are just some

154
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
and i realized that there are just some
 

155
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,430
and i realized that there are just some
basic themes that are used over and over

156
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
basic themes that are used over and over
 

157
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,949
basic themes that are used over and over
and over and they're kind of

158
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
and over and they're kind of
 

159
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,229
and over and they're kind of
misconstrued as different things so

160
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
misconstrued as different things so
 

161
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,589
misconstrued as different things so
today we're going to talk about levers

162
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
today we're going to talk about levers
 

163
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,990
today we're going to talk about levers
and leverage and how that's used in

179
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,270

all right so we're going to talk about

180
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
all right so we're going to talk about
 

181
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,190
all right so we're going to talk about
the mysteries of

182
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
the mysteries of
 

183
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,190
the mysteries of
internal power

184
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
internal power
 

185
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,190
internal power
there's a few different things those

186
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
there's a few different things those
 

187
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,790
there's a few different things those
uh

188
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
uh
 

189
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,710
uh
line out to right so one of the things

190
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
line out to right so one of the things
 

191
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,430
line out to right so one of the things
is leverage another one is

192
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
is leverage another one is
 

193
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,589
is leverage another one is
muscle distraction another one is force

194
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
muscle distraction another one is force
 

195
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,630
muscle distraction another one is force
angle

196
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
angle
 

197
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,229
angle
another one is joining force so those

198
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
another one is joining force so those
 

199
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,630
another one is joining force so those
are the ways i kind of break it down to

200
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
are the ways i kind of break it down to
 

201
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,470
are the ways i kind of break it down to
when you see these demonstrations that

202
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
when you see these demonstrations that
 

203
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,470
when you see these demonstrations that
look really amazing you're probably

204
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
look really amazing you're probably
 

205
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,910
look really amazing you're probably
seeing one of those really simple

206
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
seeing one of those really simple
 

207
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,910
seeing one of those really simple
principles those are real legitimate

208
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
principles those are real legitimate
 

209
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,750
principles those are real legitimate
principles of physics or anything else

210
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
principles of physics or anything else
 

211
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,270
principles of physics or anything else
that you can use you use them in martial

212
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
that you can use you use them in martial
 

213
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,390
that you can use you use them in martial
arts systems all the time you probably

214
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
arts systems all the time you probably
 

215
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,229
arts systems all the time you probably
use them in your regular life all the

216
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
use them in your regular life all the
 

217
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,710
use them in your regular life all the
time the the muckety muck of it and the

218
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
time the the muckety muck of it and the
 

219
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,309
time the the muckety muck of it and the
stuff that makes me mad is when people

220
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
stuff that makes me mad is when people
 

221
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,710
stuff that makes me mad is when people
get into like oh that guy's vetted to be

222
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
get into like oh that guy's vetted to be
 

223
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,910
get into like oh that guy's vetted to be
a real internal master you know and uh i

224
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
a real internal master you know and uh i
 

225
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,110
a real internal master you know and uh i
think a lot of this is just kind of

226
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
think a lot of this is just kind of
 

227
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,270
think a lot of this is just kind of
nonsense so i'm gonna show you some

228
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
nonsense so i'm gonna show you some
 

229
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,630
nonsense so i'm gonna show you some
stuff with leverage and some of it's

230
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
stuff with leverage and some of it's
 

231
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,149
stuff with leverage and some of it's
kind of interesting and cool and you can

232
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
kind of interesting and cool and you can
 

233
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,229
kind of interesting and cool and you can
kind of apply that to things you see and

234
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
kind of apply that to things you see and
 

235
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,350
kind of apply that to things you see and
you can see how you get these

236
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
you can see how you get these
 

237
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,630
you can see how you get these
demonstrations so maybe at the end if

238
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
demonstrations so maybe at the end if
 

239
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,750
demonstrations so maybe at the end if
you guys are interested i'll make a

240
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
you guys are interested i'll make a
 

241
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,869
you guys are interested i'll make a
video me doing some of these

242
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
video me doing some of these
 

243
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,949
video me doing some of these
demonstrations um or maybe i'll get

244
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
demonstrations um or maybe i'll get
 

245
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,949
demonstrations um or maybe i'll get
someone real small and and cute to do it

246
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
someone real small and and cute to do it
 

247
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,270
someone real small and and cute to do it
and be better okay

248
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
and be better okay
 

249
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,390
and be better okay
all right so we're talking about

250
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
all right so we're talking about
 

251
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,630
all right so we're talking about
leverage so leverage is just any time

252
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
leverage so leverage is just any time
 

253
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,870
leverage so leverage is just any time
we're using a lever so i got a big long

254
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
we're using a lever so i got a big long
 

255
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,189
we're using a lever so i got a big long
lever so it would really magnify things

256
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
lever so it would really magnify things
 

257
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,670
lever so it would really magnify things
uh awesomely and right here we have 20

258
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
uh awesomely and right here we have 20
 

259
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,909
uh awesomely and right here we have 20
pounds that i stuck a strap on so i got

260
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
pounds that i stuck a strap on so i got
 

261
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,749
pounds that i stuck a strap on so i got
a 20 pound weight there josh just pick

262
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
a 20 pound weight there josh just pick
 

263
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,590
a 20 pound weight there josh just pick
up the 20 pound weight

264
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
up the 20 pound weight
 

265
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,909
up the 20 pound weight
right okay so not not terribly hard for

266
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
right okay so not not terribly hard for
 

267
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,749
right okay so not not terribly hard for
josh's full-grown man he can easily pick

268
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
josh's full-grown man he can easily pick
 

269
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,550
josh's full-grown man he can easily pick
up 20 pounds okay now uh can you go to

270
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
up 20 pounds okay now uh can you go to
 

271
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,469
up 20 pounds okay now uh can you go to
the end of this lever here maybe i don't

272
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
the end of this lever here maybe i don't
 

273
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,990
the end of this lever here maybe i don't
want to get you off frame but i'll set

274
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
want to get you off frame but i'll set
 

275
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,790
want to get you off frame but i'll set
this up okay now once you get both hands

276
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
this up okay now once you get both hands
 

277
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,469
this up okay now once you get both hands
on this lever and i'm going to thread

278
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
on this lever and i'm going to thread
 

279
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,390
on this lever and i'm going to thread
that strap through there and now i want

280
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
that strap through there and now i want
 

281
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,390
that strap through there and now i want
you to pick up that 20 pound weight

282
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400

 

283
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,030

okay same 20 pounds right but now the

284
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
okay same 20 pounds right but now the
 

285
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,950
okay same 20 pounds right but now the
stick's bending josh is working real

286
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
stick's bending josh is working real
 

287
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,590
stick's bending josh is working real
hard and the weight didn't budge any and

288
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
hard and the weight didn't budge any and
 

289
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,710
hard and the weight didn't budge any and
there's no faking you can tell there's

290
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
there's no faking you can tell there's
 

291
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,469
there's no faking you can tell there's
no faking because the stick's bending

292
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
no faking because the stick's bending
 

293
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,510
no faking because the stick's bending
right it's like

294
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
right it's like
 

295
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,909
right it's like
just a ton of weight right and that's

296
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
just a ton of weight right and that's
 

297
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,670
just a ton of weight right and that's
because as this weight goes out on the

298
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
because as this weight goes out on the
 

299
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,830
because as this weight goes out on the
lever arm its weight

300
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
lever arm its weight
 

301
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,510
lever arm its weight
relatively gets magnified and that's not

302
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
relatively gets magnified and that's not
 

303
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,029
relatively gets magnified and that's not
true and we can get into physics about

304
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
true and we can get into physics about
 

305
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,430
true and we can get into physics about
it but it's not really important but

306
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
it but it's not really important but
 

307
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,510
it but it's not really important but
for his purposes its weight gets

308
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
for his purposes its weight gets
 

309
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,830
for his purposes its weight gets
magnified because he's got to move the

310
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
magnified because he's got to move the
 

311
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,310
magnified because he's got to move the
weight so much further from that end

312
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
weight so much further from that end
 

313
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,990
weight so much further from that end
that it's just really hard and he can't

314
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
that it's just really hard and he can't
 

315
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,670
that it's just really hard and he can't
get it to go anywhere all right now i

316
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
get it to go anywhere all right now i
 

317
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,909
get it to go anywhere all right now i
could make this his job a little easier

318
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
could make this his job a little easier
 

319
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,510
could make this his job a little easier
i'll put a fulcrum in here now he just

320
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
i'll put a fulcrum in here now he just
 

321
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,029
i'll put a fulcrum in here now he just
pushes down on that weight oh look and

322
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
pushes down on that weight oh look and
 

323
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,189
pushes down on that weight oh look and
it comes up easy again right okay now

324
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
it comes up easy again right okay now
 

325
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,110
it comes up easy again right okay now
look it only moved that much for how

326
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
look it only moved that much for how
 

327
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,350
look it only moved that much for how
much he moved it over there but it still

328
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
much he moved it over there but it still
 

329
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,830
much he moved it over there but it still
came up and it was easy yeah easy

330
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
came up and it was easy yeah easy
 

331
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,310
came up and it was easy yeah easy
super easy okay so that's one thing to

332
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
super easy okay so that's one thing to
 

333
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,870
super easy okay so that's one thing to
understand is how long is the lever arm

334
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
understand is how long is the lever arm
 

335
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,150
understand is how long is the lever arm
we're using

336
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
we're using
 

337
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,830
we're using
to do the work now it's a simple

338
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
to do the work now it's a simple
 

339
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,350
to do the work now it's a simple
demonstration you might see in class

340
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
demonstration you might see in class
 

341
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,110
demonstration you might see in class
physics whatever

342
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
physics whatever
 

343
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,110
physics whatever
intro to science whatever right

344
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
intro to science whatever right
 

345
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,870
intro to science whatever right
but that can be done in lots of really

346
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
but that can be done in lots of really
 

347
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,790
but that can be done in lots of really
tricky ways that becomes hard to see

348
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
tricky ways that becomes hard to see
 

349
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,870
tricky ways that becomes hard to see
right so for example let's just say

350
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
right so for example let's just say
 

351
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,749
right so for example let's just say
josh's job okay josh's job is to move

352
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
josh's job okay josh's job is to move
 

353
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,670
josh's job okay josh's job is to move
this weight and he's going to move it

354
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
this weight and he's going to move it
 

355
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,070
this weight and he's going to move it
sideways from the end of that stick okay

356
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
sideways from the end of that stick okay
 

357
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,830
sideways from the end of that stick okay
and you got to kind of lock it in there

358
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
and you got to kind of lock it in there
 

359
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,029
and you got to kind of lock it in there
he's pushing as hard as he can i should

360
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
he's pushing as hard as he can i should
 

361
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,710
he's pushing as hard as he can i should
probably move because he'll whack me all

362
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
probably move because he'll whack me all
 

363
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,990
probably move because he'll whack me all
right so he's pushing are you pushing

364
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
right so he's pushing are you pushing
 

365
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,070
right so he's pushing are you pushing
hard yeah all right i can see the stick

366
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
hard yeah all right i can see the stick
 

367
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,270
hard yeah all right i can see the stick
bending he's pushing as hard as you can

368
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
bending he's pushing as hard as you can
 

369
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,350
bending he's pushing as hard as you can
and that weight won't move at all right

370
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
and that weight won't move at all right
 

371
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,390
and that weight won't move at all right
okay now i can line the weight up with

372
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
okay now i can line the weight up with
 

373
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,909
okay now i can line the weight up with
it and now push the weight and move the

374
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
it and now push the weight and move the
 

375
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,189
it and now push the weight and move the
weight oh

376
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
weight oh
 

377
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,990
weight oh
amazingly easy right why is it so easy

378
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
amazingly easy right why is it so easy
 

379
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,909
amazingly easy right why is it so easy
and that was just a little angle change

380
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
and that was just a little angle change
 

381
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,110
and that was just a little angle change
now why did that happen well because the

382
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
now why did that happen well because the
 

383
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,150
now why did that happen well because the
lever arm is almost nothing when he's in

384
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
lever arm is almost nothing when he's in
 

385
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,309
lever arm is almost nothing when he's in
this configuration right there are no

386
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
this configuration right there are no
 

387
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,830
this configuration right there are no
angles to it so it's essentially a

388
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
angles to it so it's essentially a
 

389
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,029
angles to it so it's essentially a
straight line so it's just like he's

390
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
straight line so it's just like he's
 

391
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,309
straight line so it's just like he's
pushing with his hand it's easy for him

392
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
pushing with his hand it's easy for him
 

393
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,830
pushing with his hand it's easy for him
to push 20 pounds but if it's at 90

394
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
to push 20 pounds but if it's at 90
 

395
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,350
to push 20 pounds but if it's at 90
degrees to that and he tries to push it

396
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
degrees to that and he tries to push it
 

397
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,029
degrees to that and he tries to push it
he can't right suddenly it feels so

398
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
he can't right suddenly it feels so
 

399
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,670
he can't right suddenly it feels so
heavy so this is one of the tricks

400
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
heavy so this is one of the tricks
 

401
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,749
heavy so this is one of the tricks
that's done and i say tricks and i mean

402
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
that's done and i say tricks and i mean
 

403
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,670
that's done and i say tricks and i mean
you can you can take that for whatever

404
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
you can you can take that for whatever
 

405
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,430
you can you can take that for whatever
it is right like trick meaning it

406
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
it is right like trick meaning it
 

407
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,749
it is right like trick meaning it
deceives people now that could be used

408
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
deceives people now that could be used
 

409
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,510
deceives people now that could be used
for deceptive purposes like you know

410
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
for deceptive purposes like you know
 

411
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,070
for deceptive purposes like you know
like now give me 500 a month and i'll

412
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
like now give me 500 a month and i'll
 

413
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,830
like now give me 500 a month and i'll
teach you these secret things that's one

414
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
teach you these secret things that's one
 

415
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,029
teach you these secret things that's one
kind of deception another kind of

416
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
kind of deception another kind of
 

417
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,710
kind of deception another kind of
deception is simply here's something you

418
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
deception is simply here's something you
 

419
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,070
deception is simply here's something you
don't understand let me help you

420
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
don't understand let me help you
 

421
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,070
don't understand let me help you
understand that right so if josh were to

422
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
understand that right so if josh were to
 

423
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,230
understand that right so if josh were to
hold my arm sideways like this right and

424
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
hold my arm sideways like this right and
 

425
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,830
hold my arm sideways like this right and
i try to push josh over and be real

426
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
i try to push josh over and be real
 

427
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,430
i try to push josh over and be real
strong for me i try to push him over

428
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
strong for me i try to push him over
 

429
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,110
strong for me i try to push him over
like this this is really hard for me to

430
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
like this this is really hard for me to
 

431
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,350
like this this is really hard for me to
do because i have a lever arm now if i

432
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
do because i have a lever arm now if i
 

433
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,870
do because i have a lever arm now if i
line that lever arm up straight like

434
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
line that lever arm up straight like
 

435
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,950
line that lever arm up straight like
this super easy for me to push josh over

436
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
this super easy for me to push josh over
 

437
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,309
this super easy for me to push josh over
all of a sudden and that's because i did

438
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
all of a sudden and that's because i did
 

439
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,909
all of a sudden and that's because i did
the exact same thing that i did with

440
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
the exact same thing that i did with
 

441
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,629
the exact same thing that i did with
that stick right i aligned the lever in

442
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
that stick right i aligned the lever in
 

443
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,870
that stick right i aligned the lever in
a way that there was no length to the

444
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
a way that there was no length to the
 

445
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,350
a way that there was no length to the
lever arm right and when i was working

446
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
lever arm right and when i was working
 

447
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,510
lever arm right and when i was working
with these ideas i started calling this

448
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
with these ideas i started calling this
 

449
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,189
with these ideas i started calling this
shortening lever length right and i

450
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
shortening lever length right and i
 

451
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,390
shortening lever length right and i
don't like that because it's all just

452
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
don't like that because it's all just
 

453
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,830
don't like that because it's all just
really a part of leverage is the truth

454
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
really a part of leverage is the truth
 

455
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,749
really a part of leverage is the truth
but if you're trying to push if i'm

456
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
but if you're trying to push if i'm
 

457
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,670
but if you're trying to push if i'm
trying to push josh like this it's hard

458
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
trying to push josh like this it's hard
 

459
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,830
trying to push josh like this it's hard
to push because this lever links this

460
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
to push because this lever links this
 

461
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,230
to push because this lever links this
long but if i can line that lever up

462
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
long but if i can line that lever up
 

463
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,550
long but if i can line that lever up
here now it just got really easy so all

464
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
here now it just got really easy so all
 

465
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,990
here now it just got really easy so all
i'm doing is i'm shortening the length

466
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
i'm doing is i'm shortening the length
 

467
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,510
i'm doing is i'm shortening the length
of the lever the lever is this long

468
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
of the lever the lever is this long
 

469
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,510
of the lever the lever is this long
right now when i get it here essentially

470
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
right now when i get it here essentially
 

471
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,629
right now when i get it here essentially
because i'm pushing from my elbow

472
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
because i'm pushing from my elbow
 

473
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,990
because i'm pushing from my elbow
because i'm using my body it's

474
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
because i'm using my body it's
 

475
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,909
because i'm using my body it's
essentially nothing right so i can boom

476
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
essentially nothing right so i can boom
 

477
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,990
essentially nothing right so i can boom
i can do that another trick i can use

478
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
i can do that another trick i can use
 

479
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,510
i can do that another trick i can use
with this and there's lots of ways to do

480
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
with this and there's lots of ways to do
 

481
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,189
with this and there's lots of ways to do
this but foreign

482
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
this but foreign
 

483
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,270
this but foreign
let's say josh locks my arms down to the

484
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
let's say josh locks my arms down to the
 

485
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,589
let's say josh locks my arms down to the
ground right so oh it's so hard but i

486
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
ground right so oh it's so hard but i
 

487
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,909
ground right so oh it's so hard but i
can use leverage on my leg to get my

488
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
can use leverage on my leg to get my
 

489
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,430
can use leverage on my leg to get my
arms up and then once he's straight i

490
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
arms up and then once he's straight i
 

491
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,189
arms up and then once he's straight i
can shove him away from me right so i

492
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
can shove him away from me right so i
 

493
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,270
can shove him away from me right so i
can literally drive my arms down either

494
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
can literally drive my arms down either
 

495
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,710
can literally drive my arms down either
side and come up so even though he's

496
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
side and come up so even though he's
 

497
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,790
side and come up so even though he's
pushing my arms down i can get him up

498
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
pushing my arms down i can get him up
 

499
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,110
pushing my arms down i can get him up
right and that's not i know people have

500
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
right and that's not i know people have
 

501
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,029
right and that's not i know people have
seen the demonstration i'm not showing

502
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
seen the demonstration i'm not showing
 

503
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,469
seen the demonstration i'm not showing
the demonstration we will get around to

504
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
the demonstration we will get around to
 

505
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,350
the demonstration we will get around to
in another one we're going to go to

506
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
in another one we're going to go to
 

507
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,070
in another one we're going to go to
force angle for another one um but but

508
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
force angle for another one um but but
 

509
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,350
force angle for another one um but but
you can see that i could use the

510
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
you can see that i could use the
 

511
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,750
you can see that i could use the
leverage here to line this up right just

512
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
leverage here to line this up right just
 

513
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,509
leverage here to line this up right just
like i did with the yoga block there and

514
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
like i did with the yoga block there and
 

515
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,829
like i did with the yoga block there and
then once the lever arm length is about

516
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
then once the lever arm length is about
 

517
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,990
then once the lever arm length is about
zero i can drive into them really really

518
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
zero i can drive into them really really
 

519
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,630
zero i can drive into them really really
easy so leverage is something that is

520
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
easy so leverage is something that is
 

521
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,269
easy so leverage is something that is
really deceptive to people if you show

522
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
really deceptive to people if you show
 

523
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,710
really deceptive to people if you show
most people that i think they would be

524
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
most people that i think they would be
 

525
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,790
most people that i think they would be
surprised that 20 pounds is so heavy on

526
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
surprised that 20 pounds is so heavy on
 

527
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,630
surprised that 20 pounds is so heavy on
the end of an eight foot lever and the

528
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
the end of an eight foot lever and the
 

529
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,750
the end of an eight foot lever and the
same thing is true if you see

530
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
same thing is true if you see
 

531
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,430
same thing is true if you see
demonstrations where you get a little

532
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
demonstrations where you get a little
 

533
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,870
demonstrations where you get a little
guy and they're picked up in the air so

534
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
guy and they're picked up in the air so
 

535
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,150
guy and they're picked up in the air so
easily and then all of a sudden they

536
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
easily and then all of a sudden they
 

537
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,910
easily and then all of a sudden they
become so heavy and they fall back down

538
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
become so heavy and they fall back down
 

539
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,910
become so heavy and they fall back down
to the ground well all they're doing is

540
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
to the ground well all they're doing is
 

541
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,350
to the ground well all they're doing is
lengthening the lever arm and they can

542
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
lengthening the lever arm and they can
 

543
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,389
lengthening the lever arm and they can
do that in lots of ways you can do it

544
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
do that in lots of ways you can do it
 

545
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,870
do that in lots of ways you can do it
forward backwards sideways so angles

546
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
forward backwards sideways so angles
 

547
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,389
forward backwards sideways so angles
tend to deceive us when we're looking at

548
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
tend to deceive us when we're looking at

or pictures because they're
 

553
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,030
or pictures because they're
two-dimensional and when you add that

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
two-dimensional and when you add that
 

555
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,269
two-dimensional and when you add that
third dimension you can't see that

556
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
third dimension you can't see that
 

557
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,350
third dimension you can't see that
there's actually an angle going on

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
there's actually an angle going on

that's hard for you to pick out so a lot

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
that's hard for you to pick out so a lot
 

561
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,750
that's hard for you to pick out so a lot
of stuff would leverage that you really

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
of stuff would leverage that you really

to pick up something heavy they would
 

567
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,310
to pick up something heavy they would
grab a lever and try and do that or

oh it's something you can get a handle
 

585
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,389
oh it's something you can get a handle
on if you think about it more right and

because
i think it's too easy to deceive people

to see the angles of the lever and how
 

617
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,190
to see the angles of the lever and how
it works and

it works and
 

619
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,630
it works and
and how you can shorten that lever

and how you can shorten that lever
 

621
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,750

length and how that makes a big
 

623
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,110
