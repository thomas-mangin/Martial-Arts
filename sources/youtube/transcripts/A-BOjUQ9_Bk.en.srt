70
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:15,149
techniques naturally do appear all the
 

71
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,990
techniques naturally do appear all the
time they totally happen and this drill

72
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
time they totally happen and this drill
 

73
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,490
time they totally happen and this drill
kind of forces them to happen a lot

74
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,500
kind of forces them to happen a lot
 

75
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,050

because of the way it's built this is a

76
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,060
because of the way it's built this is a
 

77
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,609
because of the way it's built this is a
contrived drill so I'm not saying this

78
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:22,619
contrived drill so I'm not saying this
 

79
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,889
contrived drill so I'm not saying this
is totally a live drill and I think this

80
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:24,899
is totally a live drill and I think this
 

81
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:26,330
is totally a live drill and I think this
is akin to when you're doing Brazilian

82
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,340
is akin to when you're doing Brazilian
 

83
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,279
is akin to when you're doing Brazilian
jiu-jitsu and you're just rolling right

84
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:28,289
jiu-jitsu and you're just rolling right
 

85
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,139
jiu-jitsu and you're just rolling right
and this is a colloquial thing but we

86
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:30,149
and this is a colloquial thing but we
 

87
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:31,339
and this is a colloquial thing but we
used to say this you know we're just

88
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:31,349
used to say this you know we're just
 

89
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:33,529
used to say this you know we're just
rolling it just rolling means word me

90
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:33,539
rolling it just rolling means word me
 

91
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,969
rolling it just rolling means word me

95
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,400
trying to get each other we're just
having a good time when we're working

96
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,410
having a good time when we're working
 

97
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,630
having a good time when we're working
with the techniques and we're trying to

98
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
with the techniques and we're trying to
 

99
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
with the techniques and we're trying to
do stuff on each other and giving each

100
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,170
do stuff on each other and giving each
 

101
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,809
do stuff on each other and giving each
other opportunities so no one's going

102
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:41,819
other opportunities so no one's going
 

103
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,460
other opportunities so no one's going
the hardest and that's different than if

104
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,470
the hardest and that's different than if
 

105
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,410
the hardest and that's different than if
you're in a competition school where you

106
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,420
you're in a competition school where you
 

107
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,550
you're in a competition school where you
know every time you're trying to get as

108
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
know every time you're trying to get as
 

109
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,050
know every time you're trying to get as
hard as you possibly can and there's

110
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
hard as you possibly can and there's
 

111
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,910
hard as you possibly can and there's
places for both of those practices so

112
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
places for both of those practices so
 

113
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,100
places for both of those practices so
this is a live practice essentially but

114
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,110
