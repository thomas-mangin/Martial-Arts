boom pressure yielded
 

35
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,110
boom pressure yielded
into it same side

36
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
into it same side
 

37
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:18,469
into it same side
pressure yield you're looking right here

38
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479

 

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,749

action reaction okay

40
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
action reaction okay
 

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,950
action reaction okay
so i'm pushing here i

42
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
so i'm pushing here i
 

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,469

there is still the yielding
the body trap the ground vectoring it's

170
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
the body trap the ground vectoring it's
 

171
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,870
