1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,550

all right this one's different

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,560

 

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,750

okay he's going to do the back inward

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
okay he's going to do the back inward
 

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,230
okay he's going to do the back inward
Kushi cuz I'm on the inward okay so

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:13,240
Kushi cuz I'm on the inward okay so
 

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,629
Kushi cuz I'm on the inward okay so
answer some questions which way does his

8
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:15,639
answer some questions which way does his
 

9
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,790
answer some questions which way does his
inertia have to be going say it out loud

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
inertia have to be going say it out loud
 

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,750
inertia have to be going say it out loud
so the camera can hear you forward

12
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:20,760
so the camera can hear you forward
 

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,189
so the camera can hear you forward
forward okay so I can't stop from have

14
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:24,199
forward okay so I can't stop from have
 

15
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,470
forward okay so I can't stop from have
him go

16
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:25,480
him go
 

17
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,070
him go
backwards okay so his Center has to keep

18
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
backwards okay so his Center has to keep
 

19
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,790
backwards okay so his Center has to keep
going forward and and then which way

20
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
going forward and and then which way
 

21
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,590
going forward and and then which way
does he tilt back toward me away from me

22
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:34,600
does he tilt back toward me away from me
 

23
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,350
does he tilt back toward me away from me
or forward does he tilt back does he

24
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
or forward does he tilt back does he
 

25
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,470
or forward does he tilt back does he
tilt away forward or toward me toward me

26
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
tilt away forward or toward me toward me
 

27
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,430
tilt away forward or toward me toward me
cuz I'm the center of the circle okay

28
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
cuz I'm the center of the circle okay
 

29
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,310
cuz I'm the center of the circle okay
and then

30
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,320
and then
 

31
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,990
and then
uh what do if he if he goes towards me

32
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,000
uh what do if he if he goes towards me
 

33
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,110
uh what do if he if he goes towards me
where's his

34
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,120
where's his
 

35
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,150
where's his
way on his right leg or his left leg

36
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
way on his right leg or his left leg
 

37
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,270
way on his right leg or his left leg
left his left leg okay so when he comes

38
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,280
left his left leg okay so when he comes
 

39
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,430
left his left leg okay so when he comes
forward and I tilt and I stopped his

40
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:02,440
forward and I tilt and I stopped his
 

41
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,550
forward and I tilt and I stopped his
head cuz I tilted it towards

42
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:04,560
head cuz I tilted it towards
 

43
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,990
head cuz I tilted it towards
me can his left leg go forward no what

44
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
me can his left leg go forward no what
 

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,550
me can his left leg go forward no what
about his right yes so his right goes up

46
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
about his right yes so his right goes up
 

47
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,070
about his right yes so his right goes up
you see it goes up I'll hold you it goes

48
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
you see it goes up I'll hold you it goes
 

49
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,710
you see it goes up I'll hold you it goes
up that's what you're looking for this

50
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
up that's what you're looking for this
 

51
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,190
up that's what you're looking for this
position here and then here's where the

52
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
position here and then here's where the
 

53
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,749
position here and then here's where the
x pattern comes

54
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
x pattern comes
 

55
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,990
x pattern comes
in okay so you do this for example

56
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
in okay so you do this for example
 

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,870
in okay so you do this for example
exactly in C through hole and just this

58
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
exactly in C through hole and just this
 

59
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,030
exactly in C through hole and just this
is where the engine is this part goes

60
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,040
is where the engine is this part goes
 

61
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,670
is where the engine is this part goes
forward there it is right

62
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
forward there it is right
 

63
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,149
forward there it is right
there now you're going to do it with

64
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
there now you're going to do it with
 

65
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,789
there now you're going to do it with
this hand this hand does it all okay not

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
both hands this hand does it all there
 

69
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,469
both hands this hand does it all there
it is there you guys see that so I'm not

70
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:53,479
it is there you guys see that so I'm not

10 I'm not doing that
 

75
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,910
10 I'm not doing that
this hand takes his Center moves It

76
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
this hand takes his Center moves It
 

77
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,389
this hand takes his Center moves It
Forward boom

78

all right so I not going to enter behind
him I can't get

96
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,120
him I can't get
 

97
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,469
him I can't get
there I can do to bring him forward cuz

98
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
there I can do to bring him forward cuz
 

99
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,950
there I can do to bring him forward cuz
I want his Center to go

100
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:35,960

 

101
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,310

forward which way is my angle of

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
forward which way is my angle of
 

103
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,310
forward which way is my angle of
deflection

104
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
deflection
 

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,510
deflection
going to my left so which way does my

106
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,520
going to my left so which way does my
 

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,590
going to my left so which way does my
angle deviation have to has to go to the

108
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
angle deviation have to has to go to the
 

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,430
angle deviation have to has to go to the
right so I can't go up

110

145
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,830

when you do it you have to go here watch

146
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:36,840
when you do it you have to go here watch
 

147
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,070
when you do it you have to go here watch
this hand now okay this hand's going to

148
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
this hand now okay this hand's going to
 

149
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,070
this hand now okay this hand's going to
do what it always does this this shape

150
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,080
do what it always does this this shape
 

151
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,029
do what it always does this this shape
this shape this shape hold my wrist is

152
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
this shape this shape hold my wrist is
 

153
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,830
this shape this shape hold my wrist is
eal

154
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:52,840
eal
 

155
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,869
eal
okay P don't pull you have to do this

156
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:56,879
okay P don't pull you have to do this
 

157
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,270
okay P don't pull you have to do this
shape

158
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,280

 

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,670

so the quas has to

160
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680

 

161
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,990

move qu has to open but you can't rotate

162
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,000
move qu has to open but you can't rotate
 

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,070
move qu has to open but you can't rotate
your hip the qu

164
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080

 

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,909

opens and you're doing it back on the

166
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:18,919
opens and you're doing it back on the
 

167
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,469
opens and you're doing it back on the
other

168
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:21,479

 

169
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:31,469

side got p

170
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:31,479

 

171
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:42,029

okay try

172
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,039

 

173
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,909

it okay in this variation you're using

174
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919

forward feels I'm going too far or

228
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
forward feels I'm going too far or
 

229
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,069
forward feels I'm going too far or
something so I'm try not to graag into

230
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:32,079
something so I'm try not to graag into
 

231
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,389
something so I'm try not to graag into
me on that first so it's it's a spiral

232
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:35,399
me on that first so it's it's a spiral
 

233
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,509
me on that first so it's it's a spiral
not just a line but then it feels like

234
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
not just a line but then it feels like
 

235
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,310
not just a line but then it feels like
I'm going forward too far and then

236
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm going forward too far and then
 

237
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,829
I'm going forward too far and then
somehow this the the other hand ends up

238
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
somehow this the the other hand ends up
 

239
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,750
somehow this the the other hand ends up
being behind me when I'm

240
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
being behind me when I'm
 

241
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,470
being behind me when I'm
um trying to get the N hand correct so

242
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,480
um trying to get the N hand correct so
 

243
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,590
um trying to get the N hand correct so
it's it's it isn't my issue but I don't

244
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
it's it's it isn't my issue but I don't
 

245
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,430
it's it's it isn't my issue but I don't
know where I

246
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
know where I
 

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,949
know where I
was supposed to be anyone got the answer

248
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
was supposed to be anyone got the answer
 

249
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,590
was supposed to be anyone got the answer
some of you have that same exact

250
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600

 

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,269

problem yeah see this is like we often

252
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:10,279
problem yeah see this is like we often
 

253
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,110
problem yeah see this is like we often
think there's like a a architectural

254
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
think there's like a a architectural
 

255
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,790
think there's like a a architectural
problem and it's not there you can only

256
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:15,800
problem and it's not there you can only
 

257
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,949
problem and it's not there you can only
do so much with architecture then it has

258
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:17,959
do so much with architecture then it has
 

259
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,750
do so much with architecture then it has
to do with what's your

260
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
to do with what's your
 

261
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,110
to do with what's your
engine got it what's your engine because

262
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
engine got it what's your engine because
 

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,509
engine got it what's your engine because
you you can't something can have the

264
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
you you can't something can have the
 

265
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,710
you you can't something can have the
same exact architecture but the engine

266
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
same exact architecture but the engine
 

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,230
same exact architecture but the engine
is different and it will not function

268
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,240
is different and it will not function
 

269
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,949
is different and it will not function
the same okay so uh for example if we

270
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:35,959
the same okay so uh for example if we
 

271
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,230
the same okay so uh for example if we
don't have him finally displaced okay

272
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
don't have him finally displaced okay
 

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,470
don't have him finally displaced okay
and he's pulling it's not going to

274
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
and he's pulling it's not going to
 

275
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,470
and he's pulling it's not going to
matter to

276
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480

 

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,870

me you get it okay why because you're

278
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:51,880
me you get it okay why because you're
 

279
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,990
me you get it okay why because you're
not using internal which one I yes the I

280
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
not using internal which one I yes the I
 

281
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,670
not using internal which one I yes the I
there's adhesion there okay it's not

282
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:00,680
there's adhesion there okay it's not
 

283
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,550
there's adhesion there okay it's not
that he's he's coming forward and I get

284
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:03,560
that he's he's coming forward and I get
 

285
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,790
that he's he's coming forward and I get
out of the way and then I try to pull

think about
it when and this is what's happening

292
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,000
it when and this is what's happening
 

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,629
it when and this is what's happening
right you get out of the way and you go

294
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:15,639
right you get out of the way and you go
 

295
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,990
right you get out of the way and you go
like whoa that's a freaking lot why

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
like whoa that's a freaking lot why
 

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,590
like whoa that's a freaking lot why
would that

298
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
would that
 

299
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,470
would that
be uh why would that not be a young

300
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
be uh why would that not be a young
 

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,470

young Clash you see or you're having
to right goes way past me no matter how

304
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:30,639
to right goes way past me no matter how
 

305
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,190
to right goes way past me no matter how
much I move or you're going to have to

him to come off you he gets further the
 

311
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,790
him to come off you he gets further the
back brake fall and then you start ining

312
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:39,800
back brake fall and then you start ining
 

313
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,910
back brake fall and then you start ining
on the 12 lines right or you have to use

314
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:42,920
on the 12 lines right or you have to use
 

315
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,910
on the 12 lines right or you have to use
this arm to do everything that you

316
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:44,920
this arm to do everything that you
 

317
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,949
this arm to do everything that you
 up with this hand okay so you

00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
up with this hand okay so you
 

319
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,269
up with this hand okay so you
have to adhere you're adhering in the

same thing here on the neck so if you
 

325
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,389
same thing here on the neck so if you
pay attention what when we hit that turn

326
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
pay attention what when we hit that turn
 

327
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,829
pay attention what when we hit that turn
where I reconcile your forward energy

you right right okay because that's
where it gets really

334
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
where it gets really
 

335
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,030
where it gets really
sticky it gets really sticky at that

sticky it gets really sticky at that
 

337
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,110
sticky it gets really sticky at that
point because that's where the Yong

338
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,120
point because that's where the Yong
 

339
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,230
point because that's where the Yong
value increases and so the the adhesion

340
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
value increases and so the the adhesion
 

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,189
value increases and so the the adhesion
is going to be that much more friction

342
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:23,199
is going to be that much more friction
 

343
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,870
is going to be that much more friction
base okay and that if you watch that

344
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:25,880
base okay and that if you watch that
 

345
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,110
base okay and that if you watch that
technique again slow it down I never

346
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,120
technique again slow it down I never
 

347
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,629
technique again slow it down I never
even touched them with this this other

348
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:29,639
even touched them with this this other
 

349
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,230
even touched them with this this other
hand this was all this hand okay all

350
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
hand this was all this hand okay all
 

351
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,629
hand this was all this hand okay all
right so that's where you need to go and

352
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:35,639
right so that's where you need to go and
 

353
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,310
right so that's where you need to go and
and you can't you're not going to get

354
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,320
and you can't you're not going to get
 

355
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,590
and you can't you're not going to get
that in this drill in this technique it

356
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:40,600
that in this drill in this technique it
 

357
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,750
that in this drill in this technique it
assumes you have that you have to get

358
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,760
assumes you have that you have to get
 

359
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,269
assumes you have that you have to get
that in the ike sets

360
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279

he's going to be pulling he's pulling on

378
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:13,880
he's going to be pulling he's pulling on
 

379
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,230
he's going to be pulling he's pulling on
me so I have to ground the front foot

380
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,240
me so I have to ground the front foot
 

381
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,470
me so I have to ground the front foot
and my adhesion point is in his palm

382
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
and my adhesion point is in his palm
 

383
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,189
and my adhesion point is in his palm
don't try to do wrist wrist stuff okay

384
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:24,199
don't try to do wrist wrist stuff okay
 

385
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,910
don't try to do wrist wrist stuff okay
you know don't do that stuff just here

386
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
you know don't do that stuff just here
 

387
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,150
you know don't do that stuff just here
in then we go to the next adhesion on

388
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,160
in then we go to the next adhesion on
 

389
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,350
in then we go to the next adhesion on
his hand okay on on my hand uh when do

390
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
his hand okay on on my hand uh when do
 

391
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,710
his hand okay on on my hand uh when do
you think this hand can touch at the

392
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:37,720
you think this hand can touch at the
 

393
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,990
you think this hand can touch at the
center line at the right at that Center

394
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
center line at the right at that Center
 

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,910
center line at the right at that Center
Line so pull here's where they can touch

Line so pull here's where they can touch
 

397
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,550
Line so pull here's where they can touch
and then it carries it out to the Y L

398
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:45,560
and then it carries it out to the Y L
 

399
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,150
and then it carries it out to the Y L
okay again pull P he's pulling that

400
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
okay again pull P he's pulling that
 

401
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,910
okay again pull P he's pulling that
whole time meaning he doesn't just pull

whole time meaning he doesn't just pull
 

403
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,749
whole time meaning he doesn't just pull
there and now he stopped pulling he's

404
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:55,759
there and now he stopped pulling he's
 

405
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,389
there and now he stopped pulling he's
still pulling okay so home

still pulling okay so home
 

407
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,870
still pulling okay so home
H okay try it so just like I'm not going

408
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:03,880
H okay try it so just like I'm not going
 

409
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,430
H okay try it so just like I'm not going
to use wrist stuff here I'm in his palm

410
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
to use wrist stuff here I'm in his palm
 

411
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,870
to use wrist stuff here I'm in his palm
I'm moving the Palm same thing goes on

412
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm moving the Palm same thing goes on
 

413
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,430
I'm moving the Palm same thing goes on
this hand you can't come on the inside

414
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,440
this hand you can't come on the inside
 

415
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,350
this hand you can't come on the inside
and do this ledge here you see you can't

416
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
and do this ledge here you see you can't
 

417
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,670
and do this ledge here you see you can't
do that you have to be over here on the

418
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
do that you have to be over here on the
 

419
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,949
do that you have to be over here on the
outside because that's where your angle

420
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:19,959
outside because that's where your angle
 

421
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,430
outside because that's where your angle
deflection is there's no angle

422
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
deflection is there's no angle
 

423
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,310
deflection is there's no angle
deflection over here here's where you

424
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,320
deflection over here here's where you
 

425
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,550
deflection over here here's where you
get

426
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
get
 

427
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,509
get
here so it's palm and then the side of

428
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:28,519
here so it's palm and then the side of
 

429
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,269
here so it's palm and then the side of
his body is moving forward the side of

430
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
his body is moving forward the side of
 

431
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,670
his body is moving forward the side of
his arm Palm side okay try it again okay

432
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
his arm Palm side okay try it again okay
 

433
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,710
his arm Palm side okay try it again okay
we'll still have him pull he's still

434
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:39,720
we'll still have him pull he's still
 

435
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,430
we'll still have him pull he's still
pulling okay I do the same thing

436

pulling okay I do the same thing
 

437
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,670
pulling okay I do the same thing
adhesion when it gets to the Jing that's

438
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:46,680
adhesion when it gets to the Jing that's
 

439
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,990
adhesion when it gets to the Jing that's
where this other hand can touch when do

440
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,000
where this other hand can touch when do
 

441
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,310
where this other hand can touch when do
you think I can touch his

442
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,320
you think I can touch his
 

443
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,790
you think I can touch his
neck when it gets to the Jing do you see

444
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
neck when it gets to the Jing do you see
 

445
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,670
neck when it gets to the Jing do you see
then the other half you you could put it

446
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:56,680
then the other half you you could put it
 

447
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,629
then the other half you you could put it
on there just don't dare use it I

448
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
on there just don't dare use it I
 

449
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,990
on there just don't dare use it I
wouldn't do it cuz really exposes me do

450
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,000
wouldn't do it cuz really exposes me do
 

451
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,470
wouldn't do it cuz really exposes me do
you see that you have to bring him past

452
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,480
you see that you have to bring him past
 

453
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,389
you see that you have to bring him past
you and here's where your hand now

touches it okay and we'll bring It
 

457
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,430
touches it okay and we'll bring It
Forward again forward again where's how

458
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:12,440
Forward again forward again where's how
 

459
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,430
Forward again forward again where's how
far does he have to

460
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440

 

461
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,470

go Sil he passes me you see that's where

462
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,480
go Sil he passes me you see that's where
 

463
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,350
go Sil he passes me you see that's where
he has to

464
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
he has to
 

465
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,470
he has to
go

466
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480

 

467
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,230

so there everything brings him past me

468
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
so there everything brings him past me
 

469
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,269
so there everything brings him past me
to there

470
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:36,279

 

471
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,269

okay it looks just like he's pull he's

472
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
okay it looks just like he's pull he's
 

473
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,550
okay it looks just like he's pull he's
pushing that's what it should look like

474
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,560
pushing that's what it should look like
 

475
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,949
pushing that's what it should look like
okay try to you know the answer so when

476
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:43,959
okay try to you know the answer so when
 

477
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,870
okay try to you know the answer so when
he when he's pulling which foot's

478
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:45,880
he when he's pulling which foot's
 

479
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,990
he when he's pulling which foot's
grounding the front foot okay as I move

480
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,000
grounding the front foot okay as I move
 

481
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,590
grounding the front foot okay as I move
him past which foot is going to be

482
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
him past which foot is going to be
 

483
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,430
him past which foot is going to be
grounding now the back foot okay which

484
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
grounding now the back foot okay which
 

485
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,350
grounding now the back foot okay which
in this case is which of my feet the

486
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,360
in this case is which of my feet the
 

487
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,230
in this case is which of my feet the
left okay okay so that means the right

488
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
left okay okay so that means the right
 

489
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,829
left okay okay so that means the right
one is free to move the right one's free

490
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:02,839
one is free to move the right one's free
 

491
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,710
one is free to move the right one's free
to move I keep that same

492
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
to move I keep that same
 

493
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,509
to move I keep that same
adhesion keep that same ground

494
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:10,519
adhesion keep that same ground
 

495
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,670
adhesion keep that same ground
Vector boom right leg moves and I'm now

496
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:14,680
Vector boom right leg moves and I'm now
 

497
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,910

627
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,549
have not come all right we got we had a
little technical malfunction there so

628
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:55,559
little technical malfunction there so
 

629
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,909
little technical malfunction there so
we'll film what we talking about at the

630
00:19:58,909 --> 00:19:58,919
we'll film what we talking about at the
 

631
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,590
we'll film what we talking about at the
end of the previous clip and then we

632
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
end of the previous clip and then we
 

633
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,350
end of the previous clip and then we
conclude in the next clip there's two

634
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,360
conclude in the next clip there's two
 

635
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,310
conclude in the next clip there's two
versions one's wrong one's right one's

636
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
versions one's wrong one's right one's
 

637
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,990
versions one's wrong one's right one's
an external version that you have if you

638
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
an external version that you have if you
 

639
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,430
an external version that you have if you
use the external

640
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
use the external
 

641
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,950
use the external
engine the wrong version happens you

642
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:13,960
engine the wrong version happens you
 

643
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,990
engine the wrong version happens you
can't do the technique it's also not

644
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
can't do the technique it's also not
 

645
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,950
can't do the technique it's also not
Marshall aside from not being

Marshall aside from not being
 

647
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,029
Marshall aside from not being
energetically correct it's not Marshal

648
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
energetically correct it's not Marshal
 

649
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,510
energetically correct it's not Marshal
and then the other one is the right

650
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:22,520
and then the other one is the right
 

651
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,590

move the head when I step back the feet

662
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
move the head when I step back the feet
 

663
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,230
move the head when I step back the feet
follow the head I'm I'm linking okay and

664
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
follow the head I'm I'm linking okay and
 

665
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,310
follow the head I'm I'm linking okay and
now this technique does not work you got

666
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
now this technique does not work you got
 

667
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,950
now this technique does not work you got
to do this

668
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:51,960

 

669
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,990

stuff in the correct version because I

670
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,000
stuff in the correct version because I
 

671
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,149
stuff in the correct version because I
can touch his feet from here whether

672
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:57,159
can touch his feet from here whether
 

673
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,350
can touch his feet from here whether
he's going forward or whether he's

674
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
he's going forward or whether he's
 

675
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,310
he's going forward or whether he's
pulling back it doesn't matter I move

676
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
pulling back it doesn't matter I move
 

677
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,149
pulling back it doesn't matter I move
his whole body goes

678
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:05,159
his whole body goes
 

679
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,510
his whole body goes
forward not his head as I go out his

680
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:08,520
forward not his head as I go out his
 

681
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,590
forward not his head as I go out his
whole body goes

682
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:12,600

 

683
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,990

forward allowing for when does his head

684
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
forward allowing for when does his head
 

685
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,190
forward allowing for when does his head
go down when does his head come towards

686
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,200
go down when does his head come towards
 

687
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,750
go down when does his head come towards
the ground in the external engine the

688
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:20,760
the ground in the external engine the
 

689
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,750
the ground in the external engine the
head starts to come towards the ground

690
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:22,760
head starts to come towards the ground
 

691
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,350
head starts to come towards the ground
before his feet even move in the

692
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
before his feet even move in the
 

693
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,950
before his feet even move in the
internal version his head is actually

694
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:27,960
internal version his head is actually
 

695
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,149
internal version his head is actually
going up you felt as you heard Tristan

696
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
going up you felt as you heard Tristan
 

697
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,909
going up you felt as you heard Tristan
say it's going up to keep his Center

698
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
say it's going up to keep his Center
 

699
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,870
say it's going up to keep his Center
able to move forward once his Center

700
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
able to move forward once his Center
 

701
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,230
able to move forward once his Center
passes the head goes down after the

702
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,240
passes the head goes down after the
 

703
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,190
passes the head goes down after the
after the hips pass and so it doesn't go

704
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,200
after the hips pass and so it doesn't go
 

705
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,350
after the hips pass and so it doesn't go
down until it's going

706
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
down until it's going
 

707
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,830
down until it's going
back the other one he's still coming

708
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
back the other one he's still coming
 

709
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,870
back the other one he's still coming
forward and the head went

710
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
forward and the head went
 

711
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,029
forward and the head went
down on the other one his head won't go

712
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:56,039
down on the other one his head won't go
 

713
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,470
down on the other one his head won't go
down until he's going back he's looking

714
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,480
down until he's going back he's looking
 

715
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,310
down until he's going back he's looking
up he never looks down at the KN okay

716
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
up he never looks down at the KN okay
 

717
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,669
up he never looks down at the KN okay
and then we have the last

718
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:04,679
and then we have the last
 

719
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,029
and then we have the last
clip on this one the head is up then his

720
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
clip on this one the head is up then his
 

721
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,789
clip on this one the head is up then his
hips goes the head goes down what does

722
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:11,799
hips goes the head goes down what does
 

723
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,029
hips goes the head goes down what does
that do for me mechanically in terms of

the
 

729
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,750
the
am okay so it reduces the amount of

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
am okay so it reduces the amount of
 

731
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,710
am okay so it reduces the amount of
force necessary to bring the head down

732
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
force necessary to bring the head down
 

733
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,750
force necessary to bring the head down
because why

734
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
because why
 

735
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,190
because why
because what Cal andrial forces are

736
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,200
because what Cal andrial forces are
 

737
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,350
because what Cal andrial forces are
adding to it yeah so the leg is going up

738
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:34,360
adding to it yeah so the leg is going up
 

739
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,950
adding to it yeah so the leg is going up
with the centrifugal force so I don't it

740
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
with the centrifugal force so I don't it
 

741
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,909
with the centrifugal force so I don't it
doesn't I don't have to

742
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:38,919
doesn't I don't have to
 

743
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:42,710
doesn't I don't have to
goom and then pick that

744
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
goom and then pick that
 

745
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,230
goom and then pick that
up I move his head which I can do from

746
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
up I move his head which I can do from
 

747
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,549
up I move his head which I can do from
an

748
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559

 

749
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,029

adhesion when I'm external I can't touch

750
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:52,039
adhesion when I'm external I can't touch
 

751
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,470
adhesion when I'm external I can't touch
his feet from here and so when I move

752
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
his feet from here and so when I move
 

753
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,750
his feet from here and so when I move
his head it comes

754
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:56,760
his head it comes
 

755
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,110
his head it comes
down from here I can touch your

756
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120

 

757
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,720

Center okay try it again
