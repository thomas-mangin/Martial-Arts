all right i'm all mic'ed up so i'm going

50
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
all right i'm all mic'ed up so i'm going
 

51
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,470
all right i'm all mic'ed up so i'm going
to try to be as mellowly active as i can

52
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
to try to be as mellowly active as i can
 

53
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,990
to try to be as mellowly active as i can
but still we need one more person at

54
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
but still we need one more person at
 

55
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,350
but still we need one more person at
least for this drill this drill really

56
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
least for this drill this drill really
 

57
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,709
least for this drill this drill really
works great if you have

58
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
works great if you have
 

59
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,110
works great if you have
uh three or four or five people that's

60
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
uh three or four or five people that's
 

61
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,630
uh three or four or five people that's
really good we've even run it with up to

62
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
really good we've even run it with up to
 

63
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,069
really good we've even run it with up to
eight people before so

64
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
eight people before so
 

65
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,510
eight people before so
more numbers just makes it harder and

66
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
more numbers just makes it harder and
 

67
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,430
more numbers just makes it harder and
harder so basically the idea this is

68
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
harder so basically the idea this is
 

69
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,630
harder so basically the idea this is
josh and i are going to circle the

70
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
josh and i are going to circle the
 

71
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,910
josh and i are going to circle the
outside of the box

72
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
outside of the box
 

73
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,990
outside of the box
so we're always moving around what maya

74
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
so we're always moving around what maya
 

75
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,349
so we're always moving around what maya
is trying to learn to do is keep track

76
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
is trying to learn to do is keep track
 

77
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,630
is trying to learn to do is keep track
of both of us now we can switch

78
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
of both of us now we can switch
 

79
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,750
of both of us now we can switch
directions

80
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
directions
 

81
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,310
directions
go anywhere any way we want we can try

82
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
go anywhere any way we want we can try
 

83
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,070
go anywhere any way we want we can try
to work to stay behind her one of us can

84
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
to work to stay behind her one of us can
 

85
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,510
to work to stay behind her one of us can
always work to do that we can try and

86
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
always work to do that we can try and
 

87
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,990
always work to do that we can try and
distract

88
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
distract
 

89
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,590
distract
her right so we can do anything we want

90
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
her right so we can do anything we want
 

91
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,270
her right so we can do anything we want
to mess with her sensitivity to what's

92
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
to mess with her sensitivity to what's
 

93
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,390
to mess with her sensitivity to what's
going on

94
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
going on
 

95
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,109
going on
now once we enter the box we are going

96
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
now once we enter the box we are going
 

97
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,590
now once we enter the box we are going
to run

98
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
to run
 

99
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,149
to run
in a straight line through the box so if

100
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
in a straight line through the box so if

out here
like this right um and the reason is

106
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
like this right um and the reason is
 

107
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,630
like this right um and the reason is
because we're really trying to train

108
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
because we're really trying to train
 

109
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,630

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
immediate awase for maya
 

111
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,230
immediate awase for maya
from an attack from any direction so

112
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
going to run in a straight line through
 

119
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,830
going to run in a straight line through
