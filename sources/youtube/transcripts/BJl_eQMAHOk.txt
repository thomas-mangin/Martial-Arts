i'm going to finish with the sheer
nagging
and i want you to again to
look at some points here
look you need to keep this taut not a
centimeter not centimeter what happens
about here is i need to actually
move underneath the unity itself
a lot of teachers
they make the student go around them
to me that's the opposite to what we've
been doing all day
it doesn't
show fluidity in the body so i go there
his arm is taut so i actually quickly
go the opposite way
all right
