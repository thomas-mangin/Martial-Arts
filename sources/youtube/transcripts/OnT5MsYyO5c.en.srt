2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080

 

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,870

all right this is a short video just to

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
all right this is a short video just to
 

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,109
all right this is a short video just to
raise some questions as you provide your

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:16,119
raise some questions as you provide your
 

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,790
raise some questions as you provide your
video okay so again my students don't

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:19,800
video okay so again my students don't
 

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,269
video okay so again my students don't
really know this a attack because we

10
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
really know this a attack because we
 

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,830
really know this a attack because we
don't use it because it's not really an

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
don't use it because it's not really an
 

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,070
don't use it because it's not really an
energetic ritual it's one of those weird

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,080
energetic ritual it's one of those weird
 

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,270
energetic ritual it's one of those weird
dto you leftovers in my opinion okay so

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
dto you leftovers in my opinion okay so
 

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,709
dto you leftovers in my opinion okay so
I have to teach it to Virginia uh and

18
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:35,719
I have to teach it to Virginia uh and
 

19
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,030
I have to teach it to Virginia uh and
we'll just do this more conceptually

20
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
we'll just do this more conceptually
 

21
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,630
we'll just do this more conceptually
academically to get

22
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
academically to get
 

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,310
academically to get
you to start to think about the

24
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
you to start to think about the
 

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,670
you to start to think about the
technique okay and then later I'll do

26
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
technique okay and then later I'll do
 

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,110
technique okay and then later I'll do
one like how would I do it okay so uh

28
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,120
one like how would I do it okay so uh
 

29
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,709
one like how would I do it okay so uh
the attack

30
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
the attack
 

31
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,990
the attack
is grab grab the grab the shoulder and

32
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
is grab grab the grab the shoulder and
 

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,950
is grab grab the grab the shoulder and
strike okay so that that's the

34
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:01,960
strike okay so that that's the
 

35
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,950
strike okay so that that's the
attack um all right so there's a couple

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:05,960
attack um all right so there's a couple
 

37
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,950
attack um all right so there's a couple
things every time you see this technique

38
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
things every time you see this technique
 

39
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,429
things every time you see this technique
and it's you know or most times let's

40
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
and it's you know or most times let's
 

41
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,990
and it's you know or most times let's
say I'm sure someone does it a little

42
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,000
say I'm sure someone does it a little
 

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,030
say I'm sure someone does it a little
different okay but definitely more

44
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
different okay but definitely more
 

45
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,070
different okay but definitely more
commonly and in the videos uh that you

46
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
commonly and in the videos uh that you
 

47
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,230
commonly and in the videos uh that you
sent me they all did this is the naga's

48
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
sent me they all did this is the naga's
 

49
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,830
sent me they all did this is the naga's
front foot does not

50
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
front foot does not
 

51
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,910
front foot does not
move and so they will I'm going to teach

52
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
move and so they will I'm going to teach
 

53
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,469
move and so they will I'm going to teach
Virginia

54
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
Virginia
 

55
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,389
Virginia
uh they'll t

56
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:32,399
uh they'll t
 

57
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,830
uh they'll t
con out of the way of the strike don't

58
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,840
con out of the way of the strike don't
 

59
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,270
con out of the way of the strike don't
move your front foot you see this kind

60
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
move your front foot you see this kind
 

61
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,469
move your front foot you see this kind
of stuff

62
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,479
of stuff
 

63
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,870
of stuff
okay and uh as as I do it it it looks I

64
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:43,880
okay and uh as as I do it it it looks I
 

65
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,590
okay and uh as as I do it it it looks I
I don't want to give I didn't give her

66
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
I don't want to give I didn't give her
 

67
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,950
I don't want to give I didn't give her
the handw we just keeping it simple just

68
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:47,960
the handw we just keeping it simple just
 

69
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,670
the handw we just keeping it simple just
looking at the angle deviation okay so

70
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
looking at the angle deviation okay so
 

71
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,830
looking at the angle deviation okay so
as you see it it looks like it's going

72
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
as you see it it looks like it's going
 

73
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,429
as you see it it looks like it's going
to work every time okay the UK comes in

74
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
to work every time okay the UK comes in
 

75
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,950
to work every time okay the UK comes in
and she 10 come she's out of the way

76
00:01:59,950 --> 00:01:59,960
and she 10 come she's out of the way
 

77
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,029
and she 10 come she's out of the way
looks like it it's going to work

78
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:03,039
looks like it it's going to work
 

79
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,109
looks like it it's going to work
okay

80
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
okay
 

81
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,109
okay
um but if you pay

82
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:08,119
um but if you pay
 

83
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,750
um but if you pay
attention if I hold

84
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
attention if I hold
 

85
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,309
attention if I hold
here and I'm

86
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
here and I'm
 

87
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,990
here and I'm
here I can't hit the target because my

88
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
here I can't hit the target because my
 

89
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,070
here I can't hit the target because my
fingers aren't the

90
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
fingers aren't the
 

91
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,309
fingers aren't the
weapon I can't hit the target they hit

92
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:23,319
weapon I can't hit the target they hit
 

93
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,550
weapon I can't hit the target they hit
the target I have to be

94
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
the target I have to be
 

95
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,790
the target I have to be
closer here

96
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
closer here
 

97
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,630
closer here
I can drive through her

98
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,640

 

99
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,390

okay from this grab

100
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:39,400
okay from this grab
 

101
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,309
okay from this grab
distance I can't it's just my fingers

102
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
distance I can't it's just my fingers
 

103
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,869
distance I can't it's just my fingers
are doing

104
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:43,879
are doing
 

105
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,869
are doing
it

106
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:45,879
it
 

107
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,030
it
okay so point

108
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
okay so point
 

109
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,710
okay so point
one this with this arm here doing kadori

110
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
one this with this arm here doing kadori
 

111
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,190
one this with this arm here doing kadori
as a normal kadori shui is not available

112
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
as a normal kadori shui is not available
 

113
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,149
as a normal kadori shui is not available
that's point one

114
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:01,159
that's point one
 

115
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,789
that's point one
point

116
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:02,799
point
 

117
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,990
point
two as she's doing a

118
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000

 

119
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,990

Tenon then I must be

120
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
Tenon then I must be
 

121
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,390
Tenon then I must be
entering because we turn when pushed and

122
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
entering because we turn when pushed and
 

123
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,309
entering because we turn when pushed and
we enter when pulled okay so you reverse

124
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
we enter when pulled okay so you reverse
 

125
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,270
we enter when pulled okay so you reverse
engineer the technique so as the nogget

126
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
engineer the technique so as the nogget
 

127
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,229
engineer the technique so as the nogget
does the tencon I must have been coming

128
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:27,239
does the tencon I must have been coming
 

129
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,949
does the tencon I must have been coming
in okay

130
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:29,959
in okay
 

131
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,589
in okay
and then if you look at that

132
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
and then if you look at that
 

133
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,070
and then if you look at that
then that would be spinal

134
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
then that would be spinal
 

135
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,470
then that would be spinal
displacement so if I were to spinally

136
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480

 

137
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,030

displace then you now have the bigger

138
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,040
displace then you now have the bigger
 

139
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,069
displace then you now have the bigger
problem the problem of the first point

140
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:52,079
problem the problem of the first point
 

141
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,710
problem the problem of the first point
gets even worse because I'm push her

142
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
gets even worse because I'm push her
 

143
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,710
gets even worse because I'm push her
ahead of the strike it gets further out

144
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
ahead of the strike it gets further out
 

145
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,429
ahead of the strike it gets further out
due to the inertial change okay okay so

146
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
due to the inertial change okay okay so
 

147
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,190
due to the inertial change okay okay so
again you can reverse engineer if the

148
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,200
again you can reverse engineer if the
 

149
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,229
again you can reverse engineer if the
Naga is

150
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
Naga is
 

151
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,030
Naga is
tenoning then you knew that UK was

152
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,040
tenoning then you knew that UK was
 

153
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,229
tenoning then you knew that UK was
assigned spinal

154
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
assigned spinal
 

155
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,349
assigned spinal
displacement that's point two point

156
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:15,359
displacement that's point two point
 

157
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,430
displacement that's point two point
three if you now review 01 under spinal

158
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
three if you now review 01 under spinal
 

159
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,870
three if you now review 01 under spinal
displacement this problem gets worse I

160
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:21,880
displacement this problem gets worse I
 

161
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,870
displacement this problem gets worse I
miss even more

162
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:25,880

 

163
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:35,469

okay um

164
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:35,479

 

165
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,390

if you now reverse engineer from the

166
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
if you now reverse engineer from the
 

167
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:49,150
if you now reverse engineer from the
strike so I'm

168
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,160

 

169
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,350

here so I

170
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,360
here so I
 

171
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,310
here so I
grab and not

172
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320

 

173
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,870

there

174
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:57,880
there
 

175
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,189
there
here now it's starts to make

176
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
here now it's starts to make
 

177
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,909
here now it's starts to make
sense it also makes sense why you would

178
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
sense it also makes sense why you would
 

179
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,110
sense it also makes sense why you would
hold someone's arm you see this a lot

180
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
hold someone's arm you see this a lot
 

181
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,550
hold someone's arm you see this a lot
boom boom you pulled people into Stripes

182
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,560
boom boom you pulled people into Stripes
 

183
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,029
boom boom you pulled people into Stripes
okay so this is probably makes more

184
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
okay so this is probably makes more
 

185
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,070
okay so this is probably makes more
sense this way I'm not saying it does

186
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
sense this way I'm not saying it does
 

187
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,909
sense this way I'm not saying it does
that way but it makes more

188
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:24,919
that way but it makes more
 

189
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,870
that way but it makes more
sense now if you do

190
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,880
sense now if you do
 

191
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,670
sense now if you do
that when she tries to ten con now this

192
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
that when she tries to ten con now this
 

193
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,670
that when she tries to ten con now this
this doesn't

194
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
this doesn't
 

195
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,189
this doesn't
work

196
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
work
 

197
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,629
work
okay so consider that as well as you're

198
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
okay so consider that as well as you're
 

199
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,670
okay so consider that as well as you're
trying to do your stuff

200
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
trying to do your stuff
 

201
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,230
trying to do your stuff
okay and I don't want to just leave it

202
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
okay and I don't want to just leave it
 

203
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,909
okay and I don't want to just leave it
up to you so it's not fair meaning I'll

204
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:46,919
up to you so it's not fair meaning I'll
 

205
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,070
up to you so it's not fair meaning I'll
give what I'm thinking

206
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,080
give what I'm thinking
 

207
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,990
give what I'm thinking
probably is as she's

208
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,000
probably is as she's
 

209
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,990
probably is as she's
grabbing and she's pulling me into the

210
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
grabbing and she's pulling me into the
 

211
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,950
grabbing and she's pulling me into the
strike you you now can follow the r rule

212
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
strike you you now can follow the r rule
 

213
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,990
strike you you now can follow the r rule
if she's pulling then I

214
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,000
if she's pulling then I
 

215
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,390
if she's pulling then I
enter so I get pulled and I strike her

216
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
enter so I get pulled and I strike her
 

217
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,309
enter so I get pulled and I strike her
and I'll tell you why that's

218
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
and I'll tell you why that's
 

219
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,909
and I'll tell you why that's
important okay on the other version if

220
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:16,919
important okay on the other version if
 

221
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,390
important okay on the other version if
it did work at

222
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:19,400
it did work at
 

223
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,430
it did work at
all I don't think it does so she comes

224
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
all I don't think it does so she comes
 

225
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,790
all I don't think it does so she comes
here even though she can't really hit

226
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:25,800
here even though she can't really hit
 

227
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,110
here even though she can't really hit
the

228
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
the
 

229
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,350
the
target everyone that does this ver

230
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
target everyone that does this ver
 

231
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,670
target everyone that does this ver
blocks that's a young young Clash

232
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:34,680
blocks that's a young young Clash
 

233
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,710
blocks that's a young young Clash
okay if however she's pulling me in hold

234
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,720
okay if however she's pulling me in hold
 

235
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,029
okay if however she's pulling me in hold
on I got to talk if she's pulling me in

236
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
on I got to talk if she's pulling me in
 

237
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,589
on I got to talk if she's pulling me in
and I go to strike and she goes to block

238
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:46,599
and I go to strike and she goes to block
 

239
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,390
and I go to strike and she goes to block
the

240
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
the
 

241
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,390
the
strike then I didn't do the Yong Yong

242
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
strike then I didn't do the Yong Yong
 

243
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,950
strike then I didn't do the Yong Yong
clash and then my counter can go from

244
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960

 

245
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,070

there so just playing with it now in

246
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
there so just playing with it now in
 

247
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,309
there so just playing with it now in
light of all of this I think it makes

248
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:03,319
light of all of this I think it makes
 

249
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,790
light of all of this I think it makes
more sense she pulled and I came in to

250
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:07,800
more sense she pulled and I came in to
 

251
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,230
more sense she pulled and I came in to
hit and as I she pulled came to hit her

252
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,240
hit and as I she pulled came to hit her
 

253
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,710
hit and as I she pulled came to hit her
arm is there

254
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:13,720
arm is there
 

255
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,469
arm is there
okay and then everything else would come

256
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
okay and then everything else would come
 

257
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,710
okay and then everything else would come
from there what whatever the technique

258
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
from there what whatever the technique
 

259
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,430
from there what whatever the technique
is based on what she does after that

260
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
is based on what she does after that
 

261
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,589
is based on what she does after that
strike that's where everything else

262
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
strike that's where everything else
 

263
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,390
strike that's where everything else
comes from okay

264
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,400
comes from okay
 

265
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,749
comes from okay
so put that into your experiments cuz

266
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:28,759
so put that into your experiments cuz
 

267
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,070
so put that into your experiments cuz
that's what I wanted I want you to

268
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
that's what I wanted I want you to
 

269
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,070
that's what I wanted I want you to
experiment with the technique put that

270
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
experiment with the technique put that
 

271
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,670
experiment with the technique put that
in with your

272
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
in with your
 

273
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,390
in with your
experiments um as you're looking at more

274
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
experiments um as you're looking at more
 

275
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,790
experiments um as you're looking at more
videos and as you're trying to film it

276
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
videos and as you're trying to film it
 

277
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,790
videos and as you're trying to film it
and and help me out with trying to

278
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
and and help me out with trying to
 

279
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,869
and and help me out with trying to
understand your questions uh and see

280
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:42,879
understand your questions uh and see
 

281
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,670
understand your questions uh and see
what you come up with too and then I'll

282
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
what you come up with too and then I'll
 

283
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,830
what you come up with too and then I'll
play from that from there as well and

284
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:46,840
play from that from there as well and
 

285
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,360
play from that from there as well and
see what I come up with okay
