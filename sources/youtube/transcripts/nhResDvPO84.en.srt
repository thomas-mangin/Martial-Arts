00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,880

so I need to use a lot of discipline so

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:06,890
so I need to use a lot of discipline so
 

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,160
so I need to use a lot of discipline so
I know I'm not doing something different

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,170
I know I'm not doing something different
 

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,230
I know I'm not doing something different
okay I have to chase this thing's

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,240
okay I have to chase this thing's
 

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
okay I have to chase this thing's
somebody you have this locked back way

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,250
somebody you have this locked back way

this this mean this is heel weighted

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:16,730
this this mean this is heel weighted
 

11
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:23,850
this this mean this is heel weighted
okay so if he lets go and I stand here

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:23,860

 

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,930

that meant I was bracing on him so you

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:28,940
that meant I was bracing on him so you
 

15
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,770
that meant I was bracing on him so you
push this hold this knee is bent how far

16
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:32,780
push this hold this knee is bent how far
 

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,140

eita toes okay so he's pushing and we

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,150
eita toes okay so he's pushing and we
 

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,910
eita toes okay so he's pushing and we
can do that under test to get let go

20
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
can do that under test to get let go
 

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,819
can do that under test to get let go
what he wants as fast as he can and you

22
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:42,829
what he wants as fast as he can and you
 

23
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,100
what he wants as fast as he can and you
see I don't go flying forward so when

24
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,110
see I don't go flying forward so when
 

25
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,170
see I don't go flying forward so when
I'm here like this and he lets go as

26
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,180
I'm here like this and he lets go as
 

27
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm here like this and he lets go as
fast as he can

28
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,110
fast as he can
 

29
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,049
fast as he can
only you're gonna you're gonna have that

30
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:50,059
only you're gonna you're gonna have that
 

31
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:54,970
only you're gonna you're gonna have that
okay so we can do that test and since

32
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:54,980
okay so we can do that test and since
 

33
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,060
okay so we can do that test and since
I'm not racing and I'm vectoring instead

34
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,070
I'm not racing and I'm vectoring instead
 

35
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm not racing and I'm vectoring instead
I don't need my my feet you see so he's

36
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,210
I don't need my my feet you see so he's
 

37
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,279
I don't need my my feet you see so he's
pushing bar he's pushing bar and you can

be as tall as you want I'm just still
 

41
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,489
be as tall as you want I'm just still
vectoring down there right you can be

42
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:15,499
vectoring down there right you can be
 

43
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,669

square doesn't matter anything to this

44
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:18,679
square doesn't matter anything to this
 

45
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,940
square doesn't matter anything to this
thing again you see you can be mobile

46
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:21,950
thing again you see you can be mobile
 

47
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,429
thing again you see you can be mobile
and still able to do okay so I want you

48
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
and still able to do okay so I want you
 

49
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,550
and still able to do okay so I want you
to play with those two tests and then

50
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
to play with those two tests and then
 

51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,839
to play with those two tests and then
see who where was I if you find that

52
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:34,849
see who where was I if you find that
 

53
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:38,499
see who where was I if you find that
you're bracing still then it's you're

54
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:38,509
you're bracing still then it's you're
 

55
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,449
you're bracing still then it's you're
getting triggered don't want you to

56
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:40,459
getting triggered don't want you to
 

57
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,599
getting triggered don't want you to
understand it as innocent as just I

58
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:43,609
understand it as innocent as just I
 

59
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:47,139
understand it as innocent as just I
chose option B no he's triggering you

60
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:47,149
chose option B no he's triggering you
 

61
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,490
chose option B no he's triggering you
and you're trying to fight him

62
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,500
and you're trying to fight him
 

63
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,940
and you're trying to fight him
okay just stick to the form so if I feel

okay just stick to the form so if I feel
 

65
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,910
okay just stick to the form so if I feel
like I'm doing that a good new kid would

like I'm doing that a good new kid would
loosen up on you and go we're gonna

68
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
loosen up on you and go we're gonna
 

69
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
loosen up on you and go we're gonna
start again okay

start again okay
 

71
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,760
start again okay
or I feel like I'm doing this going to

72
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:01,770
or I feel like I'm doing this going to
 

73
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,840
or I feel like I'm doing this going to
go a little slower this woo oh you got

74
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:05,850
go a little slower this woo oh you got
 

75
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,419
go a little slower this woo oh you got
me okay and then I'm gonna try to do the

76
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,429
me okay and then I'm gonna try to do the
 

77
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,480
me okay and then I'm gonna try to do the
same thing again okay all right let's

78
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,490
same thing again okay all right let's
 

79
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:17,960
same thing again okay all right let's
try so I am taking this energy letting

80
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:17,970
try so I am taking this energy letting
 

81
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,850
try so I am taking this energy letting
it go through me and veteran into the

82
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:19,860
it go through me and veteran into the
 

83
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,600
it go through me and veteran into the
back foot but I don't want you to start

84
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:23,610
back foot but I don't want you to start
 

85
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,070
back foot but I don't want you to start
working with the dichotomy of stability

86
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
working with the dichotomy of stability
 

87
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,970
working with the dichotomy of stability
and then that's how are you doing so

88
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:31,980
and then that's how are you doing so
 

89
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,670
and then that's how are you doing so
that that's why I was showing you that

90
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
that that's why I was showing you that
 

91
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,090
that that's why I was showing you that
you can you can move and still you can't

92
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,100
you can you can move and still you can't
 

93
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,010
you can you can move and still you can't
do it because each foot is grounded okay

94
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,020
do it because each foot is grounded okay
 

95
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,690
do it because each foot is grounded okay
so in truth I'm going to show you the

96
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
so in truth I'm going to show you the
 

97
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,070
so in truth I'm going to show you the
beginner drill but you have to

98
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
beginner drill but you have to
 

99
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,770
beginner drill but you have to
understand it not solely from the

100
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:48,780
understand it not solely from the
 

101
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,199
understand it not solely from the
beginner perspective so the beginner

102
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,209
beginner perspective so the beginner
 

103
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,479
beginner perspective so the beginner
drill looks like it's about stability

104
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:53,489
drill looks like it's about stability
 

105
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,000
drill looks like it's about stability
but stability of the cost mobility is

106
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,010
but stability of the cost mobility is
 

107
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,090
but stability of the cost mobility is
marshal detriment so that cannot be it

108
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,100
marshal detriment so that cannot be it
 

109
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,610
marshal detriment so that cannot be it
okay the principal I gave you is

110
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
okay the principal I gave you is
 

111
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,460
okay the principal I gave you is
vectoring vectoring does not require a

112
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,470
vectoring vectoring does not require a
 

113
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,789
vectoring vectoring does not require a
static kind of static posturing it does

114
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:07,799
static kind of static posturing it does
 

115
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,430
static kind of static posturing it does
not that's why I can move with it okay

116
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:10,440
not that's why I can move with it okay
 

117
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,789
not that's why I can move with it okay
all right the next line the drill that

118
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:13,799
all right the next line the drill that
 

119
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,319
all right the next line the drill that
we're going to do now is to address the

120
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,329
we're going to do now is to address the
 

121
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,250
we're going to do now is to address the
corners of my body so we're going to pay

122
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,260
corners of my body so we're going to pay
 

123
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,280
corners of my body so we're going to pay
attention to my shoulders and my hips

124
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,290
attention to my shoulders and my hips
 

125
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,199
attention to my shoulders and my hips
okay don't do this as we did put them

126
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,209
okay don't do this as we did put them
 

127
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,440
okay don't do this as we did put them
where they go so imagine that you have a

128
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,450
where they go so imagine that you have a
 

129
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,770
where they go so imagine that you have a
beam across your back a beam across your

130
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:36,780
beam across your back a beam across your
 

131
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,819
beam across your back a beam across your
hips and then an i-beam connecting them

132
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:40,829
hips and then an i-beam connecting them
 

133
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,030
hips and then an i-beam connecting them
so that they move together they don't do

134
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
so that they move together they don't do
 

135
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,330
so that they move together they don't do
this okay alright so his drill is drill

136
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,340
this okay alright so his drill is drill
 

137
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,660
this okay alright so his drill is drill
one I'm doing drill one but I'm going to

138
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:53,670
one I'm doing drill one but I'm going to
 

139
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,559
one I'm doing drill one but I'm going to
now stress

140
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:54,569
now stress
 

141
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,690
now stress
this corner what some of you were saying

142
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:56,700
this corner what some of you were saying
 

143
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,670
this corner what some of you were saying
that was already happening

144
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
that was already happening
 

145
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,929
that was already happening
okay so I'm here like this and then I'm

146
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:02,939
okay so I'm here like this and then I'm
 

147
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,000
okay so I'm here like this and then I'm
gonna fold my arm and he's gonna go to

148
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,010
gonna fold my arm and he's gonna go to
 

149
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,490
gonna fold my arm and he's gonna go to
the elbow and because it was just energy

150
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:10,500
the elbow and because it was just energy
 

151
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,280
the elbow and because it was just energy
it doesn't matter I'm still vectoring

152
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,290
it doesn't matter I'm still vectoring
 

153
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,890
it doesn't matter I'm still vectoring
you see that and then I would have

154
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:15,900
you see that and then I would have
 

155
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,689
you see that and then I would have
released out and he's going to come to

156
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:17,699
released out and he's going to come to
 

157
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,819
released out and he's going to come to
the shoulder itself but it shouldn't

158
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:19,829
the shoulder itself but it shouldn't
 

159
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,189
the shoulder itself but it shouldn't
change anything should not change

160
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
change anything should not change
 

161
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,710
change anything should not change
anything and he can let go as fast as he

162
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
anything and he can let go as fast as he
 

163
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
anything and he can let go as fast as he
wants and you see it doesn't require me

164
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,690
wants and you see it doesn't require me
 

165
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,939
wants and you see it doesn't require me
to do that okay so again we're gonna

166
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:31,949
to do that okay so again we're gonna
 

167
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,600
to do that okay so again we're gonna
stress the corner here on I start to

168
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,610
stress the corner here on I start to
 

169
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,200
stress the corner here on I start to
take it away keeps the energy I start to

170
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,210
take it away keeps the energy I start to
 

171
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,560
take it away keeps the energy I start to
take it away and I miss ground being the

172
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,570
take it away and I miss ground being the
 

173
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,279
take it away and I miss ground being the
same vector okay and in the same way of

174
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,289
same vector okay and in the same way of
 

175
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,810
same vector okay and in the same way of
the last drill I do not need the i-beam

176
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:50,820
the last drill I do not need the i-beam
 

177
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,120
the last drill I do not need the i-beam
that has nothing to do with vectoring

178
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,130
that has nothing to do with vectoring
 

179
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,879
that has nothing to do with vectoring
okay so yeah okay you can have weird

180
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:58,889
okay so yeah okay you can have weird
 

181
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,290
okay so yeah okay you can have weird
things I'm still vectoring push you

182
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,300
things I'm still vectoring push you
 

183
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,680
things I'm still vectoring push you
could do weird it's still going down to

184
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:06,690
could do weird it's still going down to
 

185
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,379
could do weird it's still going down to
a greater mass than me do you see that

186
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:09,389
a greater mass than me do you see that
 

187
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,129
a greater mass than me do you see that
right at the beginning we're going to

188
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:13,139
right at the beginning we're going to
 

189
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,420
right at the beginning we're going to
use the four corner one two three and

190
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,430
use the four corner one two three and
 

191
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,490
use the four corner one two three and
then he's let's go okay so

192
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:25,500
then he's let's go okay so
 

193
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,880
then he's let's go okay so
his Energy's coming in or just vectoring

194
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:28,890
his Energy's coming in or just vectoring
 

195
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,430
his Energy's coming in or just vectoring
it to the back foot so that same thing

196
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
it to the back foot so that same thing
 

197
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,150
it to the back foot so that same thing
he's constant so it doesn't change okay

198
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,160
he's constant so it doesn't change okay
 

199
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,670
he's constant so it doesn't change okay
and it doesn't change it doesn't change

200
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
and it doesn't change it doesn't change
 

201
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,300
and it doesn't change it doesn't change
and therefore here you push other places

202
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,310
and therefore here you push other places
 

203
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,230
and therefore here you push other places
so if you push here and it's just going

204
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,240
so if you push here and it's just going
 

205
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,420
so if you push here and it's just going
to go down to the same back foot you can

206
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,430
to go down to the same back foot you can
 

207
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,450
to go down to the same back foot you can
take the other hand off you see and you

208
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,460
take the other hand off you see and you
 

209
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,200
take the other hand off you see and you
could let go and same exactly okay so

210
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,210
could let go and same exactly okay so
 

211
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:09,020
could let go and same exactly okay so
he's gonna go here and then I'm gonna

212
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,030
he's gonna go here and then I'm gonna
 

213
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,180
he's gonna go here and then I'm gonna
slowly take this middle one okay

214
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,190
slowly take this middle one okay
 

215
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:20,650
slowly take this middle one okay
go find it there you go

216
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:20,660
go find it there you go
 

217
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,880
go find it there you go
okay got it okay all right next my

218
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:25,890
okay got it okay all right next my
 

219
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,190
okay got it okay all right next my
pretty girl so we're gonna try to do two

220
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,200
pretty girl so we're gonna try to do two
 

221
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,150
pretty girl so we're gonna try to do two
things I would reach out to him and I

222
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,160
things I would reach out to him and I
 

223
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,530
things I would reach out to him and I
take him onto that back foot shot him on

224
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:39,540
take him onto that back foot shot him on
 

225
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,020
take him onto that back foot shot him on
the front foot and then I reached out

226
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,030
the front foot and then I reached out
 

227
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,890
the front foot and then I reached out
and I hit the ground cloud dang front

228
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:45,900
and I hit the ground cloud dang front
 

229
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,390
and I hit the ground cloud dang front
foot wait only and now I'm usually front

230
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,400
foot wait only and now I'm usually front
 

231
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,719
foot wait only and now I'm usually front
foot wait absorb boom onto the liquid

232
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:56,729
foot wait absorb boom onto the liquid
 

233
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,510
foot wait absorb boom onto the liquid
vector of the back foot let's do this

234
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
vector of the back foot let's do this
 

235
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:10,650
vector of the back foot let's do this
date this would be drills front foot

236
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:10,660

 

237
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:19,180

reach out let's go okay let's try we're

238
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,190
reach out let's go okay let's try we're
 

239
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,350
reach out let's go okay let's try we're
not I'm on the front foot push the front

240
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
not I'm on the front foot push the front
 

241
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,350
not I'm on the front foot push the front
foot is that is the vectoring foot you

242
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,360
foot is that is the vectoring foot you
 

243
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,100
foot is that is the vectoring foot you
see it's not I'm not having a crazy name

244
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,110
see it's not I'm not having a crazy name
 

245
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,060
see it's not I'm not having a crazy name
the the front foot is doing the three

246
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,070
the the front foot is doing the three
 

247
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,090
the the front foot is doing the three
for the veteran you see that okay so he

248
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,100
for the veteran you see that okay so he
 

249
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,400
for the veteran you see that okay so he
can push he's just rounding the front

250
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,410
can push he's just rounding the front
 

251
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,210
can push he's just rounding the front
foot so it's from a ground back green on

252
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,220
foot so it's from a ground back green on
 

253
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,120
foot so it's from a ground back green on
the front foot that I am released and

254
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,130
the front foot that I am released and
 

255
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,670
the front foot that I am released and
changed to the new ground you see that

256
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:48,680
changed to the new ground you see that
 

257
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,600
changed to the new ground you see that
so it's if I don't do that when I go

258
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,610
so it's if I don't do that when I go
 

259
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,180
so it's if I don't do that when I go
like that that momentum begin to God

260
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,190
like that that momentum begin to God
 

261
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,060
like that that momentum begin to God
okay so I reach out fold mean it's the

262
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,070
okay so I reach out fold mean it's the
 

263
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,980
okay so I reach out fold mean it's the
front foot and we're just hanging out

264
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:02,990
front foot and we're just hanging out
 

265
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,770
front foot and we're just hanging out
here until I decide I don't know you say

266
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:05,780
here until I decide I don't know you say
 

267
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,660
here until I decide I don't know you say
you can push it really hard and we can

268
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:07,670
you can push it really hard and we can
 

269
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,060
you can push it really hard and we can
move pushing your Mars energy shifting

270
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,070
move pushing your Mars energy shifting
 

271
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,980
move pushing your Mars energy shifting
you see and they're not changing the

272
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:11,990
you see and they're not changing the
 

273
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,140
you see and they're not changing the
ground vector do you see how I'm doing

274
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,150
ground vector do you see how I'm doing
 

275
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,380
ground vector do you see how I'm doing
that so I'm not here like this with no

276
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,390
that so I'm not here like this with no
 

277
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,630
that so I'm not here like this with no
nothing but a racing angle then I take

278
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,640
nothing but a racing angle then I take
 

279
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,180
nothing but a racing angle then I take
away the bracing angle okay if if I was

280
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,190
away the bracing angle okay if if I was
 

281
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,090
away the bracing angle okay if if I was
ground vectoring that's his energy

282
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,100
ground vectoring that's his energy
 

283
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,760
ground vectoring that's his energy
that's pinning me down so I read I am

284
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:30,770
that's pinning me down so I read I am
 

285
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,770
that's pinning me down so I read I am
letting his energy go to the greater

286
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:32,780
letting his energy go to the greater
 

287
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,000
letting his energy go to the greater
mass okay he should be doing the same

288
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,010
mass okay he should be doing the same
 

289
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,960
mass okay he should be doing the same
thing as again so he should be ground

290
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:40,970
thing as again so he should be ground
 

291
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:47,050
thing as again so he should be ground
vectoring dreaming okay maybe he

292
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,060
vectoring dreaming okay maybe he
 

293
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,260
vectoring dreaming okay maybe he
shouldn't have a weird corners right

294
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,270
shouldn't have a weird corners right
 

295
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,460
shouldn't have a weird corners right
you doesn't want to be up on his

296
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,470
you doesn't want to be up on his
 

297
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,270
you doesn't want to be up on his
shoulders see you kids doing the same

298
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,280
shoulders see you kids doing the same
 

299
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,770
shoulders see you kids doing the same
thing walking and should be able to move

300
00:08:59,770 --> 00:08:59,780
thing walking and should be able to move
 

301
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,940
thing walking and should be able to move
okay if my three kids doing that he's

302
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:03,950
okay if my three kids doing that he's
 

303
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,080
okay if my three kids doing that he's
gonna help me learn what I just did he's

304
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,090
gonna help me learn what I just did he's
 

305
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,310
gonna help me learn what I just did he's
going to help me learn that from an

306
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,320
going to help me learn that from an
 

307
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,560
going to help me learn that from an
August point of view because he's

308
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,570
August point of view because he's
 

309
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,350
August point of view because he's
already structured for an a more

310
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,360
already structured for an a more
 

311
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,900
already structured for an a more
advanced skill is to do it when the guy

312
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:16,910
advanced skill is to do it when the guy
 

313
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,570
advanced skill is to do it when the guy
is not structured for okay so if you're

314
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:19,580
is not structured for okay so if you're

you're being triggered when it goes
 

421
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,840
you're being triggered when it goes
faster you get triggered and so you end

422
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:34,850
faster you get triggered and so you end

my arm so now I stopped my drilling in

454
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,240
my arm so now I stopped my drilling in
 

455
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,410
my arm so now I stopped my drilling in
the four corner organization okay

456
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:38,420
the four corner organization okay
 

457
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,340
the four corner organization okay
and so 50% of my drilling is not

458
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,350
and so 50% of my drilling is not
 

459
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,180
and so 50% of my drilling is not
happening so instead I'm doing the same

460
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,190
happening so instead I'm doing the same
 

461
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:52,240
happening so instead I'm doing the same
