and what the OS a Comey was it is so the
 

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,769
and what the OS a Comey was it is so the
OCA call me woz is a set of pinning and

10
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:21,779
OCA call me woz is a set of pinning and

takedown methods that we use in Aikido

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:23,430
takedown methods that we use in Aikido
 

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,349
takedown methods that we use in Aikido
it's not the premier idea of the style

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
it's not the premier idea of the style
 

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,630
it's not the premier idea of the style
right so if you look at the forms then

16
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:29,640
right so if you look at the forms then
 

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,759
right so if you look at the forms then
most of the forms resolve and either a

18
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:31,769
most of the forms resolve and either a
 

19
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,889
most of the forms resolve and either a
throw or a pin so it would make you

20
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:33,899
throw or a pin so it would make you
 

21
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,389
throw or a pin so it would make you
think that Aikido must either be about

22
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
think that Aikido must either be about
 

23
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,330
think that Aikido must either be about
projecting or about controlling but the

24
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,340
projecting or about controlling but the
 

25
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,010
projecting or about controlling but the
problem is those are the things that

26
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,020
problem is those are the things that
 

27
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,660
problem is those are the things that
have gone worse like I have to do those

28
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:41,670
have gone worse like I have to do those
 

29
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,160
have gone worse like I have to do those
things so that's why I'm either pinning

30
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,170
things so that's why I'm either pinning
 

31
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,750
things so that's why I'm either pinning
or throwing like that because things

32
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:44,760
or throwing like that because things
 

33
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,100
or throwing like that because things
have gotten so bad that I get locked

34
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,110
have gotten so bad that I get locked
 

35
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,170
have gotten so bad that I get locked
down in that and the basic Aikido theory

36
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,180
down in that and the basic Aikido theory
 

37
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,000
down in that and the basic Aikido theory
that we use we would really like to do

38
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,010
that we use we would really like to do
 

39
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,619
that we use we would really like to do
nothing to anyone we would like to just

40
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:51,629
nothing to anyone we would like to just
 

41
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,150
nothing to anyone we would like to just
get away from them and not hurt them and

00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
get away from them and not hurt them and
 

43
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,319
get away from them and not hurt them and
them not hurt us and everything worked

44
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:54,329
them not hurt us and everything worked
 

45
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,450
them not hurt us and everything worked

techniques or Aikido students like to
try to change the techniques because

60
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
try to change the techniques because
 

61
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,469
try to change the techniques because
it's like oh you know I know better ways

62
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
it's like oh you know I know better ways
 

63

to pin than Aikido teaches I he teaches

64
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,280
to pin than Aikido teaches I he teaches
 

65
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,789
to pin than Aikido teaches I he teaches
dumb ways to pin but the truth is IQ

66
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
dumb ways to pin but the truth is IQ
 

67
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,350
dumb ways to pin but the truth is IQ
pins are all based around the idea of

68
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
pins are all based around the idea of
 

69
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,050
pins are all based around the idea of
pinning with autonomy versus pinning

70
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,060
pinning with autonomy versus pinning
 

71
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,130
pinning with autonomy versus pinning
with security

72
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,140
with security
 

73
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,200
with security
so all pins of course have to have some

74
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,210
so all pins of course have to have some
 

75
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,179
so all pins of course have to have some
security to them but I feel puts a

76
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:26,189
security to them but I feel puts a
 

77
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,039
security to them but I feel puts a
premium on the autonomy and doesn't put

78
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,049
premium on the autonomy and doesn't put
 

79
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,749
premium on the autonomy and doesn't put
a premium on the security if the

80
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
a premium on the security if the
 

81
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,520
a premium on the security if the
security is what you put a premium in in

82
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,530
security is what you put a premium in in
 

83
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,710

hold someone at all costs and Aikido we

88
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,250
hold someone at all costs and Aikido we
 

89
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,830
hold someone at all costs and Aikido we
don't have the absolutely hold them at

90
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
don't have the absolutely hold them at
 

91
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,810
don't have the absolutely hold them at
all costs mentality instead we have the

all costs mentality instead we have the
 

93
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,639
all costs mentality instead we have the
idea of I want autonomy while being able

00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:43,649
idea of I want autonomy while being able

that's fine because of the autonomy I've

98
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,460
that's fine because of the autonomy I've
 

99
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,069
that's fine because of the autonomy I've
afforded myself I can always still get

100
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
afforded myself I can always still get
 

101

out of there so in this video we're
going to talk a little bit about the

104

going to talk a little bit about the
 

105
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,420
going to talk a little bit about the
autonomy and how that works

106
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,430
autonomy and how that works

gonna show you some stuff okay so the
 

111
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,740
gonna show you some stuff okay so the
first part we talked about pins and

112
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,750
first part we talked about pins and
 

113
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,240
first part we talked about pins and
align to the pins look the way they look

114
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,250
align to the pins look the way they look
 

115
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,399
align to the pins look the way they look
is we have to always account for weapon

116
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:04,409
is we have to always account for weapon
 

117
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,630
is we have to always account for weapon
arm control so there's gonna be a weapon

118
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
arm control so there's gonna be a weapon
 

119
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,770
arm control so there's gonna be a weapon
the reason we're pinning this guy is

120
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:06,780
the reason we're pinning this guy is
 

121
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,059
the reason we're pinning this guy is
probably because he was armed this we've

122
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:08,069
probably because he was armed this we've
 

123
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,800
probably because he was armed this we've
got to control that weapon arm first my

124
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:09,810
got to control that weapon arm first my
 

125
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,050
got to control that weapon arm first my
second objective being the second hand

126
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,060
second objective being the second hand
 

127
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,660
second objective being the second hand
over our

128
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:13,670
over our
 

129
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,520
over our
though overall these things is my

130
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,530
though overall these things is my
 

131
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,770
though overall these things is my
autonomy so understand what I'm pinning

132
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:17,780
autonomy so understand what I'm pinning
 

133
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,140
autonomy so understand what I'm pinning
someone there are two kind of priorities

134
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,150
someone there are two kind of priorities
 

135
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,640
someone there are two kind of priorities
I could have I can have a priority of

136
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:21,650
I could have I can have a priority of
 

137
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,589
I could have I can have a priority of
security or I could have a priority of

138
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
security or I could have a priority of
 

139
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,080
security or I could have a priority of
autonomy so security means I want to

140
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,090
autonomy so security means I want to
 

141
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,550
autonomy so security means I want to
make sure he doesn't move at all

142
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,560
make sure he doesn't move at all
 

143
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,649
make sure he doesn't move at all
autonomy means that I want to make sure

144
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:29,659
autonomy means that I want to make sure
 

145
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:33,009
autonomy means that I want to make sure
I can move whenever I want so my

146
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:33,019
I can move whenever I want so my
 

147
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,619
I can move whenever I want so my
autonomy and IQ depends is actually my

148
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:35,629
autonomy and IQ depends is actually my
 

149
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,390
autonomy and IQ depends is actually my
number one and I'm gonna show you why

150
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,400
number one and I'm gonna show you why
 

151
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,429
number one and I'm gonna show you why
this is so let's say I'm holding Josh

152
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:39,439
this is so let's say I'm holding Josh
 

153
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,819
this is so let's say I'm holding Josh
down here in a classic Aikido pin okay

154
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:42,829
down here in a classic Aikido pin okay
 

155
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,619
down here in a classic Aikido pin okay
this is a classic I could open like this

156
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:44,629
this is a classic I could open like this
 

157
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,710
this is a classic I could open like this
now what I want Josh to do is Josh I

158
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
now what I want Josh to do is Josh I
 

159
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,179
now what I want Josh to do is Josh I

161
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,170
want you to hold me I'm gonna try and
get out of this so I'm gonna think
