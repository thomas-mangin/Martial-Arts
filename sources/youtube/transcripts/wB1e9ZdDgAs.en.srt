so if he has a front inward he has a

16
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
so if he has a front inward he has a
 

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,189
so if he has a front inward he has a
front outward

18
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
front outward
 

19
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,509
front outward
and if he has a back outward he has a

20
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
and if he has a back outward he has a
 

21
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,429
and if he has a back outward he has a
back inward

22

23
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,630

so for example kotage is going to be a

24

so for example kotage is going to be a
 

25
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,549
so for example kotage is going to be a

is going to be a back inward
 

29
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,549
is going to be a back inward
so normally we work the front inward and

30
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
so normally we work the front inward and
 

31
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,510
so normally we work the front inward and
equal and then go to the back outward in

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,230
the other way
here

370
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
here
 

371
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,470
here
this is now harmony

372
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
this is now harmony
 

373
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,829
this is now harmony
with where he was going

374
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
with where he was going
 

375
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,949
with where he was going
so

376
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
so
 

377
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,110
so
forget the technique

378
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
forget the technique
 

379
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,949
forget the technique
just work the potters

380
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959

 

381
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,269

this one goes this way

382
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
this one goes this way
 

383
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,870
this one goes this way
this way into a spot before it reaches

384
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
this way into a spot before it reaches
 

385
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,350
this way into a spot before it reaches
the gate of kokuho

386
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
the gate of kokuho
 

387
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,190
the gate of kokuho
you should already have picked up the

388
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
you should already have picked up the
 

389
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,910
you should already have picked up the
other inward spiral

390
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
other inward spiral
 

391
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,430
other inward spiral
boom here

392
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
boom here
 

393
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,629
boom here
oh

394
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639

 

395
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,629

i personally would be much more

396
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
i personally would be much more
 

397
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,190
i personally would be much more
interested in that

398
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
interested in that
 

399
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,990
interested in that
in a certain way okay

400
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
in a certain way okay
 

401
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,190
in a certain way okay
there was my senator my internal vectors

402
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
there was my senator my internal vectors
 

403
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,350
there was my senator my internal vectors
all that kind of thing okay

404
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
all that kind of thing okay
 

405
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,030
all that kind of thing okay
um

406
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
um
 

407
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,870
um
but

408
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
but
 

409
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,670
but
if you pay attention

410
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
if you pay attention
 

411
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,269
if you pay attention
as i said

412
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
as i said
 

413
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,509
as i said
this is how you get your kazushi and

414
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
this is how you get your kazushi and
 

415
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,590
this is how you get your kazushi and
your zones of sanctuary which are

416
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
your zones of sanctuary which are
 

417
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,389
your zones of sanctuary which are
necessary commercially

418
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
necessary commercially
 

419
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,310
necessary commercially
but another thing you get is when you

420
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
but another thing you get is when you
 

421
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,829
but another thing you get is when you
have a grappling art or a throwing art

422
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
have a grappling art or a throwing art
 

423
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,550
have a grappling art or a throwing art
that works through grappling

424
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
that works through grappling
 

425
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,230
that works through grappling
you're going to need your open-end

426
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
you're going to need your open-end
 

427
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,790
you're going to need your open-end
triangles because it is very low

428
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
triangles because it is very low
 

429
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,430
triangles because it is very low
percentage to grab things

430
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
percentage to grab things
 

431
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,150
percentage to grab things
when they're resisting etcetera etcetera

432
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
when they're resisting etcetera etcetera
 

433
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,230
when they're resisting etcetera etcetera
so you learn that doesn't work and you

434
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
so you learn that doesn't work and you
 

435
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,910
so you learn that doesn't work and you
learn how

436
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
learn how
 

437
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,829
learn how
to

438
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
to
 

439
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,030
to
find limbs

440
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
find limbs
 

441
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,389
find limbs
by first having his center which usually

442
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
by first having his center which usually
 

443
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,910
by first having his center which usually
people that don't understand this

444
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
people that don't understand this
 

445
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,910
people that don't understand this
inverse this and they think uh

446
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
inverse this and they think uh
 

447
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,310
inverse this and they think uh
that they're going to have a limb to get

448
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
that they're going to have a limb to get
 

449
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,150
that they're going to have a limb to get
the center but it doesn't it doesn't

450
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
the center but it doesn't it doesn't
 

451
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,430
the center but it doesn't it doesn't
work okay

452
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
work okay
 

453
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,389
work okay
so

454
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
so
 

455
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,230
so
he touches and you always have his

456
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
he touches and you always have his
 

457
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,590
he touches and you always have his
center right away and then you can keep

458
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
center right away and then you can keep
 

459
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,110
center right away and then you can keep
getting his center through the limb

460
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
getting his center through the limb
 

461
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,150
getting his center through the limb
but towards that end to work that

462
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
but towards that end to work that
 

463
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,590
but towards that end to work that
strategy you're going to need to

464
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
strategy you're going to need to
 

465
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,590
strategy you're going to need to
uh control the center line with traps

466
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
uh control the center line with traps
 

467
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,509
uh control the center line with traps
and that means open end triangles

468
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
and that means open end triangles
 

469
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,750
and that means open end triangles
because he has to land into these things

470
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
because he has to land into these things
 

471
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,629
because he has to land into these things
okay

472
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
okay
 

473
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,590
okay
so if you watch the technique now

474
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
so if you watch the technique now
 

475
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,790
so if you watch the technique now
uh you'll see that my arms are always in

476
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
uh you'll see that my arms are always in
 

477
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,509
uh you'll see that my arms are always in
front of me and they're always in these

478
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
front of me and they're always in these
 

479
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,590
front of me and they're always in these
triangle shapes okay

480
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
triangle shapes okay
 

481
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,389
triangle shapes okay
i was always in these triangle shapes

482
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
i was always in these triangle shapes
 

483
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,350
i was always in these triangle shapes
here

484
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
here
 

485
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,829
here
whoa

486
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
whoa
 

487
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,590
whoa
and now you've made your aikido

488
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
and now you've made your aikido
 

489
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,310
and now you've made your aikido
consistent with every other single

490
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
consistent with every other single
 

491
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,189
consistent with every other single
trapping art that's out there

492
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
trapping art that's out there
 

493
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,509
trapping art that's out there
as opposed to

494
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
as opposed to
 

495
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,509
as opposed to
this kind of stuff

496
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
this kind of stuff
 

497
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,829
this kind of stuff
and then you get punched in the face and

498
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
and then you get punched in the face and
 

499
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,910
and then you get punched in the face and
you go what happened

500
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
you go what happened
 

501
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,990
you go what happened
so everything is on my center line

502
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
so everything is on my center line
 

503
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:34,790
so everything is on my center line
[Music]

504
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800

 

505
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,910

it appears to be much tighter do you see

506
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
it appears to be much tighter do you see
 

507
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,910
it appears to be much tighter do you see
it's not all out here like this

508
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920

 

509
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,550

because my spirals are doing it all for

510
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
because my spirals are doing it all for
 

511
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,949
because my spirals are doing it all for
me

512

513
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,670

so keep your hands here

514
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
so keep your hands here
 

515
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,670
so keep your hands here
make everything work

516
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
make everything work
 

517
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,829

you go here
 

525
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,590
you go here
when you go like this right to left

526
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
when you go like this right to left
 

527
