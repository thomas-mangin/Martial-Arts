111
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,869
still there you see still there so I'm
going to go around that energy and

112
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
going to go around that energy and
 

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,990
going to go around that energy and
that's when it so push on me you see

153
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,189

get out of the

154
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
get out of the
 

155
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,189
get out of the
wrist cannot smell the pin and go to the

156
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
wrist cannot smell the pin and go to the
 

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,510
wrist cannot smell the pin and go to the
pin okay so when you're here like this

158
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,520
pin okay so when you're here like this
 

159
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,870
pin okay so when you're here like this
it's not going to be shove him down push

160
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
it's not going to be shove him down push
 

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,110
it's not going to be shove him down push
down you're going to use an inverse

162
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,120
down you're going to use an inverse
 

163
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,070
down you're going to use an inverse
spiral of EO to get him down so that's

164
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
spiral of EO to get him down so that's
 

165
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,469
spiral of EO to get him down so that's
why I need him to go that

166
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
why I need him to go that
 

167

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,830

me I'll show two hand transition details

200
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
me I'll show two hand transition details
 

201
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,909
me I'll show two hand transition details
in the version we're doing okay so we'll

202
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
in the version we're doing okay so we'll
 

203
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,749
in the version we're doing okay so we'll
we have first

204
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
we have first
 

205
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,189
we have first
part this part here okay

206
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:36,199
part this part here okay
 

207
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,629
part this part here okay
so this comes here this will take over

208
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:39,639
so this comes here this will take over
 

209
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,950
so this comes here this will take over
there there you have your elbow control

210
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:41,960
there there you have your elbow control
 

211
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,950
there there you have your elbow control
I'm going to go inside and go to that

212
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm going to go inside and go to that
 

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,350
I'm going to go inside and go to that
adhesion

214
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
adhesion
 

215
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,950
adhesion
control then I'll have a fulcrum here in

216
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:49,960
control then I'll have a fulcrum here in
 

217
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,230
control then I'll have a fulcrum here in
between this

218
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
between this
 

219
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,550
between this
fulcrum and this elbow control I can

220
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
fulcrum and this elbow control I can
 

221
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,070
fulcrum and this elbow control I can
turn my hands turn my hand and grab his

finger locks in the place where the
 

253
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,070
finger locks in the place where the
energy can go into him to grip the

254
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
energy can go into him to grip the
 

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,790
energy can go into him to grip the
sunu there it is right there so again

256
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:53,800
sunu there it is right there so again
 

257
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,590
sunu there it is right there so again
you got

258

how I would be here right it's going to
 

293
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,230
how I would be here right it's going to
get very awkward that's very awkward so

294
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,240
get very awkward that's very awkward so
 

295
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,269
get very awkward that's very awkward so
before it gets awkward I change hands

296
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
before it gets awkward I change hands
 

297
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,910
before it gets awkward I change hands
I'm in the same block same

298
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm in the same block same
 

299
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,670
I'm in the same block same
lock this controls the elbow to give me

300
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:08,680
lock this controls the elbow to give me
 

301
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,910
lock this controls the elbow to give me
the bend to give me the leverage I need

302
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:10,920
the bend to give me the leverage I need
 

303
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,389
the bend to give me the leverage I need
so he has a straight arm he'll come Bend

304
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:13,399
so he has a straight arm he'll come Bend
 

305
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,110
so he has a straight arm he'll come Bend
his elbow you'll get it can do it this

306
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,120
his elbow you'll get it can do it this
 

307
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,470
his elbow you'll get it can do it this
way you can do it with the technique

308
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
way you can do it with the technique
 

309
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,550

he'll be too strong Bend in place so

312
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:27,399
he'll be too strong Bend in place so
 

313
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,630
he'll be too strong Bend in place so
again you're going to get

314
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:29,640
again you're going to get
 

315
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,870
