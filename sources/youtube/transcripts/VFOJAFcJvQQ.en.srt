00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
all this starts when they start coming
 

345
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,110
all this starts when they start coming
in at you you start the the preferencing

346
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
in at you you start the the preferencing
 

347
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,749
in at you you start the the preferencing
and the fear and now you're picking and

348
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
and the fear and now you're picking and
 

349
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,350
and the fear and now you're picking and
then it doesn't fit and now you're

350
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
then it doesn't fit and now you're
 

351
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,430
then it doesn't fit and now you're
wrapped up okay so

352
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
wrapped up okay so
 

353
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,670
wrapped up okay so
if i'm getting nervous

354
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
if i'm getting nervous
 

355
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,830
if i'm getting nervous
or starting that cycle at the moment

356
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
or starting that cycle at the moment
 

357
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,589
or starting that cycle at the moment
that my uke comes in

358
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
that my uke comes in
 

359
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,990
that my uke comes in
don't do your technique there

360
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000

 

361
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,510

can con and let the body mind relax

362
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
can con and let the body mind relax
 

363
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,909
can con and let the body mind relax
okay because you already responded to

364
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
okay because you already responded to
 

365
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,270
okay because you already responded to
that thing

366
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
that thing
 

367
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,309
that thing
and in that relaxed state you might have

368
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
and in that relaxed state you might have
 

369
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,469
and in that relaxed state you might have
a better chance of allowing what's

370
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
a better chance of allowing what's
 

371
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,790
a better chance of allowing what's
happening the other tool that i want to

372
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
happening the other tool that i want to
 

373
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,629
happening the other tool that i want to
give you is the age-old one is that

374
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
give you is the age-old one is that
 

375
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,469
give you is the age-old one is that
there's no technique for this

376
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
there's no technique for this
 

377
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,070
there's no technique for this
okay it's about immersion and explosion

378
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
okay it's about immersion and explosion
 

379
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,029
okay it's about immersion and explosion
so

380
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
so
 

381
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,309
so
go back to the basics you need to be by

382
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
go back to the basics you need to be by
 

383
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,230
go back to the basics you need to be by
someone who's formless

384
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
someone who's formless
 

385
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,390
someone who's formless
and you need to

386
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
and you need to
 

387
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,189
and you need to
get [\h__\h] by them because you're gonna

388
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
get [\h__\h] by them because you're gonna
 

389
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,909
get [\h__\h] by them because you're gonna
get kicked you're gonna get a chomp in

390
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
get kicked you're gonna get a chomp in
 

391
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,390
get kicked you're gonna get a chomp in
the throat you know what i'm saying and

392
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
the throat you know what i'm saying and
 

393
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,270
the throat you know what i'm saying and
you kind of like okay i get how this is

394
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
you kind of like okay i get how this is
 

395
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,990
you kind of like okay i get how this is
i get what's going on okay

396
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
i get what's going on okay
 

397
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,710
i get what's going on okay
in in that same way you're also

398
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
in in that same way you're also
 

399
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,629
in in that same way you're also
developing your body for

400
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
developing your body for
 

401
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,749
developing your body for
functioning without necessarily you

402
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
functioning without necessarily you
 

403
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,350
functioning without necessarily you
thinking

404
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
thinking
 

405
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,869
thinking
you see

406
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
you see
 

407
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,589
you see
and that's about familiarity because if

408
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
and that's about familiarity because if
 

409
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,110
and that's about familiarity because if
you're exposing yourself you're doing

410
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
you're exposing yourself you're doing
 

411
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,710
you're exposing yourself you're doing
more reps right

412
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
more reps right
 

413
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,589
more reps right
okay and so when you're when your body

414
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
okay and so when you're when your body
 

415
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,469
okay and so when you're when your body
can kind of take over

416
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
can kind of take over
 

417
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,469
can kind of take over
and you've got to a certain point you

418
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
and you've got to a certain point you
 

419
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,710
and you've got to a certain point you
might find it easier now to let your

420
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
might find it easier now to let your
 

421
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,350
might find it easier now to let your
mind not start that cycle

422
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
mind not start that cycle
 

423
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,589
mind not start that cycle
okay i'm not saying that because your

424
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
okay i'm not saying that because your
 

425
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,550
okay i'm not saying that because your
body is now having muscle memory

426
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
body is now having muscle memory
 

427
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,430
body is now having muscle memory
you you get to you know

428
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
you you get to you know
 

429
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,230
you you get to you know
uh

430
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
uh
 

431
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,990
uh
you now have an unfettered mind that

432
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
you now have an unfettered mind that
 

433
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,230
you now have an unfettered mind that
doesn't that's not it but what happens

434
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
doesn't that's not it but what happens
 

435
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,670
doesn't that's not it but what happens
is is that you're so exposed to that

436
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
is is that you're so exposed to that
 

437
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,509
is is that you're so exposed to that
initial

438
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
initial
 

439
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,750
initial
thing that jacks you up

440
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
thing that jacks you up
 

441
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,630
thing that jacks you up
that your body starts

442
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
that your body starts
 

443
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,870
that your body starts
feeling and sensing the

444
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
feeling and sensing the
 

445
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,430
feeling and sensing the
how futile it is to keep getting anxious

446
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
how futile it is to keep getting anxious
 

447
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,710
how futile it is to keep getting anxious
at that state

448
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
at that state
 

449
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,590
at that state
right on maybe on the 5th or 100th rep

450
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
right on maybe on the 5th or 100th rep
 

451
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,990
right on maybe on the 5th or 100th rep
of someone coming in

452
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
of someone coming in
 

453
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,150
of someone coming in
but after 10 000

454
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
but after 10 000
 

455
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,630
but after 10 000
your body's gonna go really

456
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
your body's gonna go really
 

457
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,269
your body's gonna go really
really this is i seem to have survived

458
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
really this is i seem to have survived
 

459
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,910
really this is i seem to have survived
10 000 of these things i don't need to

460
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
10 000 of these things i don't need to
 

461
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,870
10 000 of these things i don't need to
hold my breath anymore okay and the body

462
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
hold my breath anymore okay and the body
 

463
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,470
hold my breath anymore okay and the body
starts to release

464
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
starts to release
 

465
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,150
starts to release
and when the body releases them you

466
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
and when the body releases them you
 

467
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,150
and when the body releases them you
might have a chance for the mind again

468
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
might have a chance for the mind again
 

469
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,590
might have a chance for the mind again
for some people will other people know

470
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600

 

471
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,550

so

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
just didn't need a target
 

549
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,790
just didn't need a target
i went through the reps

550
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
i went through the reps
 

551
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,790
i went through the reps
and i just did not get as tired and that

552
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
and i just did not get as tired and that
 

553
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,430
and i just did not get as tired and that
worrying about being able to do me was

554
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
worrying about being able to do me was
 

555
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,670
worrying about being able to do me was
tiring me yeah just like you said yes

556
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
tiring me yeah just like you said yes
 

557
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,670
tiring me yeah just like you said yes
and so i kind of experimented with that

558
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
and so i kind of experimented with that
 

559
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,030
and so i kind of experimented with that
and i feel like that was the only thing

560
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
and i feel like that was the only thing
 

561
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,190
and i feel like that was the only thing
i really got from this session that's a

562
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
i really got from this session that's a
 

563
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,630
i really got from this session that's a
huge thing but huge okay and now the

564
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
huge thing but huge okay and now the
 

565
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,190
huge thing but huge okay and now the
thing is to be able to do it

566
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
thing is to be able to do it
 

567
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,430
thing is to be able to do it
when they're really trying to kill me

568
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
when they're really trying to kill me
 

569
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,230
when they're really trying to kill me
and i only have one rep to get it right

570
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
and i only have one rep to get it right
 

571
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,350
and i only have one rep to get it right
okay at full speed that's the idea which

572
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
okay at full speed that's the idea which
 

573
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,870
okay at full speed that's the idea which
we're nowhere near right in this class

574
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
we're nowhere near right in this class
 

575
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,550
we're nowhere near right in this class
all right and something else

576
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560

 

577
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,350

about

uh we were asking the same question
 

583
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,710
uh we were asking the same question
before all these people showed up yeah

584
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
before all these people showed up yeah
 

585
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,710
before all these people showed up yeah
it's the same dialogue same thing

586
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
it's the same dialogue same thing
 

587
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,630
it's the same dialogue same thing
and the answer is

588
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
and the answer is
 

589
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,310
and the answer is
just to calm down and don't pick a

i'll find another technique or something
 

615
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,030
i'll find another technique or something
else to do so back to my point about

616
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
else to do so back to my point about
 

617
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,350
else to do so back to my point about
don't lose that intention right don't

618
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
don't lose that intention right don't

initial attention we're still training

624
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
initial attention we're still training
 

625
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,350
initial attention we're still training
you're still giving an action i'm still

626
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
you're still giving an action i'm still
 

627
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,430

this thing of the techniques right
those pie pieces those partitions

644
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
those pie pieces those partitions
 

645
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,629
those pie pieces those partitions
that the fictions

646
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
that the fictions
 

647
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,030
that the fictions
okay

648
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040

 

649
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,550

be honest

650
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560

 

651
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,550

how many of you tried different

652
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
how many of you tried different
 

653
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,310
how many of you tried different
techniques for the sake of doing

654
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
techniques for the sake of doing
 

655
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,190
techniques for the sake of doing
something different okay that's what

656
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
something different okay that's what
 

657
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,509
something different okay that's what
rob's talking about

658
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
rob's talking about
 

659
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,790
rob's talking about
you you

660
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
you you
 

661
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,269
you you
if what you were doing before was in

662
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
if what you were doing before was in
 

663
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,509
if what you were doing before was in
perfect harmony with the attack that's

664
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
perfect harmony with the attack that's
 

665
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,350
perfect harmony with the attack that's
coming in that is a spontaneous

666
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
coming in that is a spontaneous
 

667
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,629
coming in that is a spontaneous
expression

668
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
expression
 

669
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,590
expression
okay

670
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
okay
 

671
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,350
okay
now when you try to do something

672
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
now when you try to do something
 

673
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,069
now when you try to do something
different you're you're not spontaneous

674
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
different you're you're not spontaneous
 

675
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,269
different you're you're not spontaneous
