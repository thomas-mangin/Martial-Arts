00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,030

okay let's look at something so in in

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,040
okay let's look at something so in in
 

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,390
okay let's look at something so in in
your iido

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
your iido
 

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,350
your iido
tabaki you will always have some

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
tabaki you will always have some
 

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,230
tabaki you will always have some
built-in Yin yields those Yin yields are

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
built-in Yin yields those Yin yields are
 

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,150
built-in Yin yields those Yin yields are
going to be used for you

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,160
going to be used for you
 

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,830
going to be used for you
to um measure and adapt to the Y

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:24,840
to um measure and adapt to the Y
 

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,550
to um measure and adapt to the Y
value of his energy okay so for example

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:29,560
value of his energy okay so for example
 

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,470
value of his energy okay so for example
if you watch my if you watch my hands

16
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
if you watch my if you watch my hands
 

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,869
if you watch my if you watch my hands
stop if you watch my hands they're going

18
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:34,879
stop if you watch my hands they're going
 

19
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:35,750
stop if you watch my hands they're going
to

20
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
to
 

21
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,029
to
do various types of circle movements and

22
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:40,039
do various types of circle movements and
 

23
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,990
do various types of circle movements and
if you watch my shoulders you just I

24
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
if you watch my shoulders you just I
 

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,950
if you watch my shoulders you just I
won't do my hands but you watch my

26
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:43,960
won't do my hands but you watch my
 

27
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,950
won't do my hands but you watch my
shoulders my shoulders are making my

28
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
shoulders my shoulders are making my
 

29
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,869
shoulders my shoulders are making my
hands move uh both forward or back or in

30
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
hands move uh both forward or back or in
 

31
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,549
hands move uh both forward or back or in
or out and you add that it gets pretty

32
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:53,559
or out and you add that it gets pretty
 

33
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,069
or out and you add that it gets pretty
Dynamic okay uh as opposed to over here

34
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,079
Dynamic okay uh as opposed to over here
 

35
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,229
Dynamic okay uh as opposed to over here
like this grabs and you're just here and

36
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
like this grabs and you're just here and
 

37
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,110
like this grabs and you're just here and
you're trying to do these things it

38
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,120
you're trying to do these things it
 

39
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,750
you're trying to do these things it
never really changes the relationship

40
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,760
never really changes the relationship
 

41
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,870
never really changes the relationship
that we have initially so as I as I do

42
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
that we have initially so as I as I do
 

43
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,789
that we have initially so as I as I do
my test saki there's a yield so we look

44
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
my test saki there's a yield so we look
 

45
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,270
my test saki there's a yield so we look
at this hand even though it's going

46
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,280
at this hand even though it's going
 

47
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,270
at this hand even though it's going
forward it's yielding because it's

48
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,280
forward it's yielding because it's
 

49
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,950
forward it's yielding because it's
coming on the inside I'm going to come

50
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:17,960
coming on the inside I'm going to come
 

51
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,830
coming on the inside I'm going to come
on the inside so I come on the inside

52
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:20,840
on the inside so I come on the inside
 

53
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,990
on the inside so I come on the inside
you

54
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
you
 

55
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,590
you
see and then the same thing is this hand

56
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:24,600
see and then the same thing is this hand
 

57
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,510
see and then the same thing is this hand
is coming this way you see that it goes

58
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
is coming this way you see that it goes
 

59
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,830
is coming this way you see that it goes
it's going back

60
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,840
it's going back
 

61
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,910
it's going back
okay

62
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920

 

63
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,190

some systems will do it pretty

64
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
some systems will do it pretty
 

65
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,190
some systems will do it pretty
dynamically in the wrist only okay so

66
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
dynamically in the wrist only okay so
 

67
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,350
dynamically in the wrist only okay so
let's say that uh he's doing some sort

68
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
let's say that uh he's doing some sort
 

69
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,870
let's say that uh he's doing some sort
of push right and you'll see uh

70
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:45,880
of push right and you'll see uh
 

71
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,389
of push right and you'll see uh
movements like

72
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
movements like
 

73
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,990
movements like
that and in that motion do you see how I

74
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
that and in that motion do you see how I
 

75
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,510
that and in that motion do you see how I
have his Center in that motion we just

76
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
have his Center in that motion we just
 

77
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,310
have his Center in that motion we just
do it with our body as opposed to just

78
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
do it with our body as opposed to just
 

79
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,590
do it with our body as opposed to just
my wrist moves okay my whole body moves

80
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:02,600
my wrist moves okay my whole body moves
 

81
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,990
my wrist moves okay my whole body moves
but again here I have a center again I

82
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,000
but again here I have a center again I
 

83
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,029
but again here I have a center again I
used

84
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:06,039
used
 

85
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,309
used
it so that's why you can't from there

86
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
it so that's why you can't from there
 

87
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,110
it so that's why you can't from there
cuz in

88
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120

 

89
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,309

that on there cuz in that moment You'

90
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
that on there cuz in that moment You'
 

91
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,830
that on there cuz in that moment You'
gathered his

92
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840

 

93
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,750

Center sometimes it's very small it's

94
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:28,760
Center sometimes it's very small it's
 

95
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,430
Center sometimes it's very small it's
very small and it looks looks like I

96
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,440
very small and it looks looks like I
 

97
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,150
very small and it looks looks like I
just went forward but it's very small

98
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160

 

99
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:58,750

instead can be

100
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760

 

101
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:34,190

big

102
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,200

 

103
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,110

I want you to pay attention to that

104
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,120
I want you to pay attention to that
 

105
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:55,630
I want you to pay attention to that
little yield that always happens

106
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,640

 

107
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,350

boom it's the same thing here that we

108
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,360
boom it's the same thing here that we
 

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,069
boom it's the same thing here that we
were doing the other day you here I went

110
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:01,079
were doing the other day you here I went
 

111
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,630
were doing the other day you here I went
on the outside there's my yield and now

112
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:03,640
on the outside there's my yield and now
 

113
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:12,830
on the outside there's my yield and now
I know his y value and I match

114
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,710

it you kind of do it internally too and

116
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
it you kind of do it internally too and
 

117
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,110
it you kind of do it internally too and
that's a higher skill so here I'm doing

118
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
that's a higher skill so here I'm doing
 

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,069
that's a higher skill so here I'm doing
those

120
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:21,079
those
 

121
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,870
those
yields uh with a mixture so as I'm

122
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
yields uh with a mixture so as I'm
 

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,590
yields uh with a mixture so as I'm
moving my hand into a Yin yield I

124
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,600
moving my hand into a Yin yield I
 

125
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,350
moving my hand into a Yin yield I
am chemically energetically matching his

126
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,360
am chemically energetically matching his
 

127
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,870
am chemically energetically matching his
y value so that I get his Center at the

128
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
y value so that I get his Center at the
 

129
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,510
y value so that I get his Center at the
end of

130
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
end of
 

131
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,110
end of
it but you can do it internally so it

132
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,120
it but you can do it internally so it
 

133
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,469
it but you can do it internally so it
looks like I'm going forward but it's

134
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
looks like I'm going forward but it's
 

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:58,550
looks like I'm going forward but it's
happening

136
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560

 

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,430

internally

138
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,440
internally
 

139
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,510
internally
so even as I'm going back like this to

140
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,520
so even as I'm going back like this to
 

141
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,070
so even as I'm going back like this to
do it I am internally as he's pushing

142
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,080
do it I am internally as he's pushing
 

143
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,230
do it I am internally as he's pushing
it's not that I'm getting out of the way

144
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,240
it's not that I'm getting out of the way
 

145
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,590
it's not that I'm getting out of the way
and trying to do something it's

146
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
and trying to do something it's
 

147
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,870
and trying to do something it's
internally his energy is going past me

148
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
internally his energy is going past me
 

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,189
internally his energy is going past me
okay and as it's going past me

150
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
okay and as it's going past me
 

151
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,950
okay and as it's going past me
eventually I'll have it and then you'll

152
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
eventually I'll have it and then you'll
 

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,469
eventually I'll have it and then you'll
have his

154
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479

 

155
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:48,590

Center

156
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,600

 

157
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,270

internal making

158
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
internal making
 

159
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,150
internal making
sure now there's a reason why in my

160
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
sure now there's a reason why in my
 

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,830
sure now there's a reason why in my
opinion iido doesn't just do

162
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:56,840
opinion iido doesn't just do
 

163
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,070
opinion iido doesn't just do
internal although some other Arts do

164
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
internal although some other Arts do
 

165
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,990
internal although some other Arts do
okay and the reason being so if we're if

166
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,000
okay and the reason being so if we're if
 

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,790
okay and the reason being so if we're if
we're internal it's true that I have a

168
