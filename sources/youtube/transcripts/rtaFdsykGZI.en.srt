7
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,709
uh please don't sue me hindes catchup
but uh these are my 57 techniques with

8
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:11,719
but uh these are my 57 techniques with
 

9
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,870
but uh these are my 57 techniques with
the exception of the showman series that

10
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:13,880
the exception of the showman series that
 

11
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,950
the exception of the showman series that
I use to teach my students formal iido

12
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
I use to teach my students formal iido
 

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,750
I use to teach my students formal iido
um and we're going to talk about ushiro

14
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:18,760
um and we're going to talk about ushiro
 

15
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,230
um and we're going to talk about ushiro
rata and so the three techniques I show

16
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
rata and so the three techniques I show
 

17
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,429
rata and so the three techniques I show
from that are ID Minag KAG and iot to

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
from that are ID Minag KAG and iot to
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,750
from that are ID Minag KAG and iot to
now again it's not that um there aren't

20
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:28,760
now again it's not that um there aren't
 

21
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,310
now again it's not that um there aren't
there's tons of other techniques right

22
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
there's tons of other techniques right
 

23
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,069
there's tons of other techniques right
and and it's not that we don't do those

24
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
and and it's not that we don't do those
 

25
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,869
and and it's not that we don't do those
techniques in the school it's that in

26
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:34,879
techniques in the school it's that in
 

27
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,229
techniques in the school it's that in
respect to this total list if you know

28
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:37,239
respect to this total list if you know
 

29
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,670
respect to this total list if you know
the totality of the list you will learn

30
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
the totality of the list you will learn
 

31
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,110
the totality of the list you will learn
the other bits of those other ushiro

32
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,120
the other bits of those other ushiro
 

33
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,389
the other bits of those other ushiro
riio catador techniques in other forms

34
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
riio catador techniques in other forms
 

35
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,750
riio catador techniques in other forms
and these are a little more

36
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
and these are a little more
 

37
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,110
and these are a little more
quintessential for me and I think

38
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
quintessential for me and I think
 

39
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,910
quintessential for me and I think
they're learned best in this so there's

40
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:48,920
they're learned best in this so there's
 

41
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,350
they're learned best in this so there's
only three techniques forio catador and

42
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
only three techniques forio catador and
 

43
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,270
only three techniques forio catador and
again not that that's all we teach but

44
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
again not that that's all we teach but
 

45
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,310
again not that that's all we teach but
just for the formal techniques I'm going

46
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,320
just for the formal techniques I'm going
 

47
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,430
just for the formal techniques I'm going
to get Josh over here you're going to to

48
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,440
to get Josh over here you're going to to
 

49
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,460
to get Josh over here you're going to to
work Josh

50
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,470
work Josh

all right let's talk about usir rata and

58
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:20,680
all right let's talk about usir rata and
 

59
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,710
all right let's talk about usir rata and
the three forms that I consider the

60
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
the three forms that I consider the
 

61
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,830
the three forms that I consider the
formal forms for it I can't emphasize

62
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
formal forms for it I can't emphasize
 

63
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,390
formal forms for it I can't emphasize
this enough there are tons of perfectly

64
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:27,400
this enough there are tons of perfectly
 

65
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,390
this enough there are tons of perfectly
acceptable great iido techniques but

66
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
acceptable great iido techniques but
 

67
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,270
acceptable great iido techniques but
these three forms are are pretty much

68
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
these three forms are are pretty much
 

69
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,990
these three forms are are pretty much
the the things that are like forms that

70
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
the the things that are like forms that
 

71
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,870
the the things that are like forms that
you need to know that are unique in in

72
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
you need to know that are unique in in
 

73
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,030
you need to know that are unique in in
this and um understand this also comes

74
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,040
this and um understand this also comes
 

75
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,830
this and um understand this also comes
from a bigger set of other stuff and

76
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
from a bigger set of other stuff and
 

77
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,469
from a bigger set of other stuff and
we've talked before about how sh real

78
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:43,479
we've talked before about how sh real
 

79
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,270
we've talked before about how sh real
Cota might happen um but you know if we

80
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
Cota might happen um but you know if we
 

81
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,030
Cota might happen um but you know if we
were talking about the hoki for Josh

82
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
were talking about the hoki for Josh
 

83
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,950
were talking about the hoki for Josh
right okay so know my basic hoki for uh

84
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:49,960
right okay so know my basic hoki for uh
 

85
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,550
right okay so know my basic hoki for uh
usir Riata is to cut to the outside

86
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
usir Riata is to cut to the outside
 

87
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,429
usir Riata is to cut to the outside
that's my basic one right and when I do

88
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:54,439
that's my basic one right and when I do
 

89
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,510
that's my basic one right and when I do
that let me go to the other side for you

90
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
that let me go to the other side for you
 

91
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,350
that let me go to the other side for you
guys too so you can see when I do that I

92
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
guys too so you can see when I do that I
 

93
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,109
guys too so you can see when I do that I
really want to pull this shoulder free

94
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
really want to pull this shoulder free
 

95
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,270
really want to pull this shoulder free
and push this shoulder free and that's

96
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
and push this shoulder free and that's
 

97
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,109
and push this shoulder free and that's
my basic my basic form and that's going

98
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
my basic my basic form and that's going
 

99
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,789
my basic my basic form and that's going
to be the simplest easiest thing to do

100
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
to be the simplest easiest thing to do
 

101
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,350
to be the simplest easiest thing to do
when he's driving you on a line it's

102
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,360
when he's driving you on a line it's
 

103
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,630
when he's driving you on a line it's
going to be the easiest way to keep your

104
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:07,640
going to be the easiest way to keep your
 

105
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,790
going to be the easiest way to keep your
balance and all this other stuff right

106
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:09,800
balance and all this other stuff right
 

107
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,990
balance and all this other stuff right
okay now if I choose to go to a

108
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,000
okay now if I choose to go to a
 

109
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,350
okay now if I choose to go to a
direction and he shoots his arm out that

110
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
direction and he shoots his arm out that
 

111
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,070
direction and he shoots his arm out that
side I can't get out right so see he's

112
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,080
side I can't get out right so see he's
 

113
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,949
side I can't get out right so see he's
shooting his arm out so he can't get out

114
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
shooting his arm out so he can't get out
 

115
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,750
shooting his arm out so he can't get out
so that enables me to have inside action

116
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
so that enables me to have inside action
 

117
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,509
so that enables me to have inside action
right so I get this udashi is what we

118
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:23,519
right so I get this udashi is what we
 

119
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,070
right so I get this udashi is what we
call it just to go around the arms and

120
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,080
call it just to go around the arms and
 

121
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,270
call it just to go around the arms and
that gives us inside action for that

122
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
that gives us inside action for that
 

123
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,710
that gives us inside action for that
right okay now if I'm doing those back

124
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
right okay now if I'm doing those back
 

125
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,509
right okay now if I'm doing those back
and forth he really I'm going to

126
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
and forth he really I'm going to
 

127
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,030
and forth he really I'm going to
actually try to catch him in one of

128
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
actually try to catch him in one of
 

129
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,470
actually try to catch him in one of
those either turning to the outside or

130
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
those either turning to the outside or
 

131
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,350
those either turning to the outside or
turning to the inside but what he could

132
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,360
turning to the inside but what he could
 

133
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,350
turning to the inside but what he could
do is he could pull me in really really

134
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,360
do is he could pull me in really really
 

135
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,149
do is he could pull me in really really
tight and if he pulls me in really tight

136
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:42,159
tight and if he pulls me in really tight
 

137
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,589
tight and if he pulls me in really tight
I can't get those because I'm all stuck

138
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
I can't get those because I'm all stuck
 

139
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,070
I can't get those because I'm all stuck
up here so that's where our CAG comes in

140
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,080
up here so that's where our CAG comes in
 

141
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,070
up here so that's where our CAG comes in
and then he could also shove Me Away

142
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
and then he could also shove Me Away
 

143
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,830
and then he could also shove Me Away
really really hard so I can't get either

144
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
really really hard so I can't get either
 

145
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,190
really really hard so I can't get either
of those he's really strong and that's

146
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
of those he's really strong and that's
 

147
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,190
of those he's really strong and that's
where ikio to comes in right so that's

148
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
where ikio to comes in right so that's
 

149
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,790
where ikio to comes in right so that's
that's my four set for hoki that I use

150
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
that's my four set for hoki that I use
 

151
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,430
that's my four set for hoki that I use
and students get that Prett pretty early

152
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
and students get that Prett pretty early
 

153
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,550
and students get that Prett pretty early
I expect you to see that at uh 7th Q so

154
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,560
I expect you to see that at uh 7th Q so
 

155
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,110
I expect you to see that at uh 7th Q so
um you're going to get that pretty early

156
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
um you're going to get that pretty early
 

157
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,070
um you're going to get that pretty early
but then extensions of that is to get a

158
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
but then extensions of that is to get a
 

159
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,589
but then extensions of that is to get a
full form right and so we have three for

160
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
full form right and so we have three for
 

161
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,509
full form right and so we have three for
the full form okay now we have edim

162
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:12,519
the full form okay now we have edim
 

163
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,270
the full form okay now we have edim
Minag which you don't see in the hoki

164
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
Minag which you don't see in the hoki
 

165
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,910
Minag which you don't see in the hoki
and the edim Minag is really hard to do

166
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
and the edim Minag is really hard to do
 

167
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,750
and the edim Minag is really hard to do
um kids are better at taking you Kim for

168
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:18,760
um kids are better at taking you Kim for
 

169

um kids are better at taking you Kim for
this not hard to do for nag easy to do

170
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
this not hard to do for nag easy to do
 

171
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,670
this not hard to do for nag easy to do
for nag but hard to do for the adults

172
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
for nag but hard to do for the adults
 

173
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,470
for nag but hard to do for the adults
because you have to have real

174
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
because you have to have real
 

175
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,789
because you have to have real
flexibility in your arms and you have to

176
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:25,799
flexibility in your arms and you have to
 

177
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,350
flexibility in your arms and you have to
have a pretty good grip and so if you're

178
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
have a pretty good grip and so if you're
 

179
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,990
have a pretty good grip and so if you're
really light right so the kids weigh you

180
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
really light right so the kids weigh you
 

181
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,149
really light right so the kids weigh you
know 70 80 lbs whatever right they could

182
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
know 70 80 lbs whatever right they could
 

183
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,589
know 70 80 lbs whatever right they could
a little just a little bigger right

184
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
a little just a little bigger right
 

185
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,789
a little just a little bigger right
can't can't be a jockey yet but anyway

186
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:35,799
can't can't be a jockey yet but anyway
 

187
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,750
can't can't be a jockey yet but anyway
so um the kids are light so they're

188
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
so um the kids are light so they're
 

189
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,070
so um the kids are light so they're
grips more than adequate and they're

190
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,080
grips more than adequate and they're
 

191
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,710
grips more than adequate and they're
usually really flexible so that it's

192
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
usually really flexible so that it's
 

193
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,390
usually really flexible so that it's
easy for them to stay on this but most

194
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
easy for them to stay on this but most
 

195
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,390
easy for them to stay on this but most
adults you'll break free before this so

adults you'll break free before this so
 

197
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,190

203
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,429
stuck with me so I'm going to shoot all
the way around it right now most people

204
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:54,439
the way around it right now most people
 

205
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,190
the way around it right now most people
right here will break right so when I go

206
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,200
right here will break right so when I go
 

207
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,550
right here will break right so when I go
like this most people are going to break

208
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,560
like this most people are going to break
 

209
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,910
like this most people are going to break
free that's just the way it's going to

210
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:58,920
free that's just the way it's going to
 

211
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,030
free that's just the way it's going to
be but some people who are flexible will

212
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
be but some people who are flexible will
 

213
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,429
be but some people who are flexible will
manage to stick on and they can stick on

214
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:04,439
manage to stick on and they can stick on
 

215
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,069
manage to stick on and they can stick on
all the way to this EDI position right

216
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,079
all the way to this EDI position right
 

217
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,470
all the way to this EDI position right
and you see Josh doesn't have the

218
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
and you see Josh doesn't have the
 

219
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,030
and you see Josh doesn't have the
flexibility for it I don't anymore

220
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,040
flexibility for it I don't anymore
 

221
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,470
flexibility for it I don't anymore
either um but uh if they could really

222
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
either um but uh if they could really
 

223
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,309
either um but uh if they could really
stay stuck the edium position is what

224
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
stay stuck the edium position is what
 

225
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,869
stay stuck the edium position is what
comes out of that now we have an ed

226
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:15,879
comes out of that now we have an ed
 

227
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,030
comes out of that now we have an ed
Minag there because if they manage to

228
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,040
Minag there because if they manage to
 

229
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,710
Minag there because if they manage to
stick on that long their balance is

230
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
stick on that long their balance is
 

231
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,430
stick on that long their balance is
going to be shot and so that is the

232
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
going to be shot and so that is the
 

233
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,950
going to be shot and so that is the
thing to do but if you just worried

234

245
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,590
simple but um that's why that is one of
the forms that we use okay then the

246
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
the forms that we use okay then the
 

247
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,430
the forms that we use okay then the
other two are included in the hoki but

other two are included in the hoki but
 

249
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,670
other two are included in the hoki but
they're also full forms and they're
