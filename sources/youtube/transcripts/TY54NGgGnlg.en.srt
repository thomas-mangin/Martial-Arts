1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,630

okay let go over Showman's

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:05,640
okay let go over Showman's
 

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,950
okay let go over Showman's
again uh so you do not you do not it is

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:09,960
again uh so you do not you do not it is
 

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,310
again uh so you do not you do not it is
not a quadricep

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
not a quadricep
 

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,830
not a quadricep
exercise so it's not about how low you

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:15,840
exercise so it's not about how low you
 

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,550
exercise so it's not about how low you
go and it's not a sword cutting exercise

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
go and it's not a sword cutting exercise
 

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,670
go and it's not a sword cutting exercise
although it can concentrically be

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:24,680
although it can concentrically be
 

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,589
although it can concentrically be
such and it's definitely not a arm a

14
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
such and it's definitely not a arm a
 

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,950
such and it's definitely not a arm a
forearm or grrip strengthening or

16
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:29,960
forearm or grrip strengthening or
 

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,910
forearm or grrip strengthening or
shoulder strengthening any kind of arm

18
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
shoulder strengthening any kind of arm
 

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,830
shoulder strengthening any kind of arm
strengthening okay so we have to learn

20
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:34,840
strengthening okay so we have to learn
 

21
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,709
strengthening okay so we have to learn
how to do it internally so it's an

22
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:37,719
how to do it internally so it's an
 

23
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,869
how to do it internally so it's an
internal aspect drill okay and the first

24
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
internal aspect drill okay and the first
 

25
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,110
internal aspect drill okay and the first
part is really just a solo it's it's in

26
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,120
part is really just a solo it's it's in
 

27
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,270
part is really just a solo it's it's in
essence a solar drill in the sense that

I'm going to take the energy of my own

30
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm going to take the energy of my own
 

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,029
I'm going to take the energy of my own
matter in conjunction with gravity

32
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
matter in conjunction with gravity
 

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,910
matter in conjunction with gravity
generates an energy and that energy I

34
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
generates an energy and that energy I
 

35
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,950

make that energy come down

46
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
make that energy come down
 

47
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,429
make that energy come down
okay

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
um when I do that my energy and your
 

51
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,749
um when I do that my energy and your
energy go to the ground Vector okay well

52
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:28,759
energy go to the ground Vector okay well
 

53
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,510

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,360
it and I'm going
 

61
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,389
it and I'm going
to uh have two Coq projection points

62
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:45,399
to uh have two Coq projection points
 

63
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,030
to uh have two Coq projection points
once I bring the sword into it and then

64
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,040
once I bring the sword into it and then
 

65
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,149
once I bring the sword into it and then
in the interim I have two iy adhesion

66
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
in the interim I have two iy adhesion
 

67
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,029
in the interim I have two iy adhesion
points on my grip into the sword okay so

68
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:56,039
points on my grip into the sword okay so
 

69
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,069
points on my grip into the sword okay so
the first poke you projection point is

70
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
the first poke you projection point is
 

71
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,429
the first poke you projection point is
when the sword comes down

72
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:00,439
when the sword comes down

foot okay when the energy passes through
 

163
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,030

you you don't need that foot even to
 

165
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,030
you you don't need that foot even to
project him off if I needed that foot

166
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,040
project him off if I needed that foot
 

167
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,830
project him off if I needed that foot
when I going to push him I'll push me

168
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
when I going to push him I'll push me
 

169
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,150
when I going to push him I'll push me
off cuz he has the BRAC angle and I

170
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
off cuz he has the BRAC angle and I
 

171
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,670
off cuz he has the BRAC angle and I
don't okay so our drill

172
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
don't okay so our drill
 

173
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,790
don't okay so our drill
is first get your weight on that midot

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
is first get your weight on that midot
 

175
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,749
is first get your weight on that midot
Vector then you do your palms and

176
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:32,759
Vector then you do your palms and
 

177
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,270
Vector then you do your palms and
they're trying to push you back and you

178
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
they're trying to push you back and you
 

179
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,590
they're trying to push you back and you
take his energy and you bring it onto

180
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
take his energy and you bring it onto
 

181
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,310
take his energy and you bring it onto
that midfoot Vector um let's be more

182
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
that midfoot Vector um let's be more
 

183
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,830
that midfoot Vector um let's be more
straight okay this

184
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:46,840
straight okay this
 

185
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,629
straight okay this
way again if he lets go I should not go

186
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
way again if he lets go I should not go
 

187
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,830
way again if he lets go I should not go
flying forward because my energy is just

188
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
flying forward because my energy is just
 

189
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,430
flying forward because my energy is just
going down he lets go and I don't fly

190
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,440
going down he lets go and I don't fly
 

191
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,790
going down he lets go and I don't fly
forward okay uh so we'll do that if

192
00:04:59,790 --> 00:04:59,800
forward okay uh so we'll do that if
 

193
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,230
forward okay uh so we'll do that if
they're holding it and you're giving

194
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
they're holding it and you're giving
 

195
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,430
they're holding it and you're giving
good ample energy then let go and see

196
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,440
good ample energy then let go and see
 

197
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,950
good ample energy then let go and see
okay here we go

198
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
okay here we go
 

199
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,710
okay here we go
uh do not confuse stability with uh you

200
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:13,720
uh do not confuse stability with uh you
 

201
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,950
uh do not confuse stability with uh you
you being lower so I can have my my legs

202
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
you being lower so I can have my my legs
 

203
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,830
you being lower so I can have my my legs
locked you see and he's pushing and not

204
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
locked you see and he's pushing and not
 

205
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,510
locked you see and he's pushing and not
same thing I'm not going anywhere I keep

206
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
same thing I'm not going anywhere I keep
 

207
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,390
same thing I'm not going anywhere I keep
pushing as I move I can move you

208
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
pushing as I move I can move you
 

209
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,629
pushing as I move I can move you
see push push more straight because uh

210
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:29,639
see push push more straight because uh
 

211
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,230
see push push more straight because uh
dummy's watching it we go oh he's

212
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,240
dummy's watching it we go oh he's
 

213
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,029
dummy's watching it we go oh he's
pushing you down okay you want you want

pushing you down okay you want you want
 

215
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,150
pushing you down okay you want you want
to push against you you understand okay

216
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
to push against you you understand okay
 

217
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,270
to push against you you understand okay
so I can go down you might have to lower

218
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,280
so I can go down you might have to lower
 

219
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,790
so I can go down you might have to lower
yourself to keep the to keep the

downward angle I could go down you see

222
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:41,800
downward angle I could go down you see
 

223
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,590
downward angle I could go down you see
and it's still going it's going into

224
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
and it's still going it's going into
 

225
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,670
and it's still going it's going into
that same spot I could go up I can go on

226
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:46,680
that same spot I could go up I can go on
 

227
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,189
that same spot I could go up I can go on
one leg I can move I can

dance okay and you're not going to push
me over you got it so

232
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,240
me over you got it so
 

233
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,550
me over you got it so
don't don't go oh he's pushing me over

234
00:05:59,550 --> 00:05:59,560
don't don't go oh he's pushing me over
 

235
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,550
don't don't go oh he's pushing me over
over let me lower my center it's not

236
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,560
over let me lower my center it's not
 

237
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,510
over let me lower my center it's not
it's not about your external

238
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:04,520
it's not about your external
 

239
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,670
it's not about your external
geometry okay it's about your internal

240
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:08,680
geometry okay it's about your internal
 

241
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,469
geometry okay it's about your internal
now there's a psychological component as

242
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
now there's a psychological component as
 

243
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,150
now there's a psychological component as
you try to not be knocked over that is

244
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
you try to not be knocked over that is
 

245
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,150
you try to not be knocked over that is
when your body will start to tense so

246
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,160
when your body will start to tense so
 

247
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,749
when your body will start to tense so
you're like don't let him knock me over

248
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:20,759
you're like don't let him knock me over
 

249
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,790
you're like don't let him knock me over
don't let me knock and then when he I'm

250
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
don't let me knock and then when he I'm
 

251
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,870
don't let me knock and then when he I'm
tense now and he releases that's when

252
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
tense now and he releases that's when
 

253
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,950
tense now and he releases that's when
you go

254
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:25,960
you go
 

255
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,909
you go
forward so as you're getting it

256
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
forward so as you're getting it
 

257
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,550
forward so as you're getting it
not only release your

258
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:31,560
not only release your
 

259

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
includes all the desires so he can let
 

263
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,350
includes all the desires so he can let
go any time and I don't go fine forward

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,360
go any time and I don't go fine forward
 

265
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,510
go any time and I don't go fine forward
got it you you have to watch when you

266
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,520
got it you you have to watch when you
 

267
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,469
got it you you have to watch when you
start going ah Eureka Eureka he didn't

268
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:45,479
start going ah Eureka Eureka he didn't
 

269
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,950
start going ah Eureka Eureka he didn't
get me cuz you're probably tensing and

270
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:47,960
get me cuz you're probably tensing and
 

271
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,550
get me cuz you're probably tensing and
you can't feel it okay let try it

272
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:51,560
you can't feel it okay let try it
 

273
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,309
you can't feel it okay let try it
again so usually when you start out your

274
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:55,319
again so usually when you start out your
 

275
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,510
again so usually when you start out your
anxiety your your fear your dichotomous

276
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
anxiety your your fear your dichotomous
 

277
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,270
anxiety your your fear your dichotomous
mind your Will To Power you're going to

278
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,280
mind your Will To Power you're going to
 

279
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,670
mind your Will To Power you're going to
feel not at first CU when you first

280
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:04,680
feel not at first CU when you first
 

281
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,469
feel not at first CU when you first
start you're living like that but after

282
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
start you're living like that but after
 

283
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,270
start you're living like that but after
a while the first place you feel you can

284
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
a while the first place you feel you can
 

285
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,029
a while the first place you feel you can
recognize your tension is in your

286
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
recognize your tension is in your
 

287
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,710
recognize your tension is in your
shoulders okay but the uh what after you

288
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
shoulders okay but the uh what after you
 

289
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,909
shoulders okay but the uh what after you
can learn to reconcile that release that

290
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
can learn to reconcile that release that
 

291
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,189
can learn to reconcile that release that
you're going to find that the fear is

292
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
you're going to find that the fear is
 

293
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,430
you're going to find that the fear is
actually in my legs and then my lower

294
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,440
actually in my legs and then my lower
 

295
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,189
actually in my legs and then my lower
legs okay uh and that is really what has

296
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:28,199
legs okay uh and that is really what has
 

297
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,909
legs okay uh and that is really what has
to relax it you you're going to feel woo

298
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
to relax it you you're going to feel woo
 

299
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,990
to relax it you you're going to feel woo
oh yeah they're flexing and then you

300
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
oh yeah they're flexing and then you
 

301
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,589
oh yeah they're flexing and then you
have to release that so that the energy

302
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
have to release that so that the energy
 

303
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,350
have to release that so that the energy
goes all the way through you to the map

304
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
goes all the way through you to the map
 

305
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,749
goes all the way through you to the map
okay um

306
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
okay um
 

307
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,390
okay um
so we'll we'll up the energy right uh

308
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,400
so we'll we'll up the energy right uh
 

309
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,550
so we'll we'll up the energy right uh
and so as you up the energy the more uh

310
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
and so as you up the energy the more uh
 

311
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,589
and so as you up the energy the more uh
grounding the more I have to ground

312
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:52,599
grounding the more I have to ground
 

313
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,430
grounding the more I have to ground
because there's more energy to ground

314
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,440
because there's more energy to ground
 

315
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,070
because there's more energy to ground
okay so here it was him trying to push

316
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,080
okay so here it was him trying to push
 

317
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,790
okay so here it was him trying to push
me but once I go to displ you're going

318
00:07:59,790 --> 00:07:59,800
me but once I go to displ you're going
 

319
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,909
me but once I go to displ you're going
to increase the energy and that is when

320
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:02,919
to increase the energy and that is when
 

321
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,710
to increase the energy and that is when
you as the energy increases that's when

322
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:05,720
you as the energy increases that's when
 

323
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,230
you as the energy increases that's when
you are going to feel whether oh yeah I

324
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
you are going to feel whether oh yeah I
 

325
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,550
you are going to feel whether oh yeah I
did feel for the flexion in my legs okay

326
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
did feel for the flexion in my legs okay
 

327
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,670

so he's doing the first drill but at

328
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:12,680
so he's doing the first drill but at
 

329
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,670
so he's doing the first drill but at
some point I'm going to project him off

330
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
some point I'm going to project him off
 

331
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,629
some point I'm going to project him off
and you're going to see whether you're

332
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:17,639
and you're going to see whether you're
 

333
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,909
and you're going to see whether you're
tense or not cuz if you're tense you're

334
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
tense or not cuz if you're tense you're
 

335
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,510
tense or not cuz if you're tense you're
you'll bounce off the him he has he has

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:22,520
you'll bounce off the him he has he has
 

337

okay so I have to release the lower legs

342
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
okay so I have to release the lower legs
 

343
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,269
okay so I have to release the lower legs
as much as

344
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279

 

345
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,350

possible that means you're going to feel

346
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
possible that means you're going to feel
 

347
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,029
possible that means you're going to feel
them tense in all likelihood and then

348
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:40,039
them tense in all likelihood and then
 

349
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,829
them tense in all likelihood and then
you have to release you have to

350
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
you have to release you have to
 

351
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,350
you have to release you have to
consciously relax them like corpse pose

352
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,360
consciously relax them like corpse pose
 

353
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,790
