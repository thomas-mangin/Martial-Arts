00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359

 

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,509

and you've gone so soft

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
and you've gone so soft
 

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,270
and you've gone so soft
that you wonder why you're in problems

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,280
that you wonder why you're in problems
 

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,190
that you wonder why you're in problems
now

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
now
 

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,589
now
it's because she was daydreaming into

10
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
it's because she was daydreaming into
 

11
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:25,189
it's because she was daydreaming into
oblivion without direction

12
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199

 

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,349

i gotta keep turning

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
i gotta keep turning
 

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:38,069
i gotta keep turning
i'll keep turning

16
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079

 

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,470

until he can get

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
until he can get
 

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,030
until he can get
this softness until i can get that

20
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
this softness until i can get that
 

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,869
this softness until i can get that
that's where it looks hard

22
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
that's where it looks hard
 

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,950
that's where it looks hard
but then you put your sharpness into it

24
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
but then you put your sharpness into it
 

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,270
but then you put your sharpness into it
your your perfectionist if you like you

26
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
your your perfectionist if you like you
 

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,430
your your perfectionist if you like you
go

28
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440

 

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,029

you can't do that

30
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
you can't do that
 

31
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,229
you can't do that
i must be getting something wrong

32
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
i must be getting something wrong
 

33
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,310
i must be getting something wrong
and i showed you this one so he's like

34
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
and i showed you this one so he's like
 

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,630
and i showed you this one so he's like
the trick to me and i can't do it on him

36
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
the trick to me and i can't do it on him
 

37
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,109
the trick to me and i can't do it on him
that's all right i can't do it on him

38
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
that's all right i can't do it on him
 

39
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,830
that's all right i can't do it on him
even with all my own theory

40
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
even with all my own theory
 

41
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,550
even with all my own theory
and that's why i said it was the worst

42
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
and that's why i said it was the worst
 

43
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,190
and that's why i said it was the worst
technique i can think of

44
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
technique i can think of
 

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,789
technique i can think of
because he's now worked out the plan

46
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
because he's now worked out the plan
 

47
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,149
because he's now worked out the plan
so there's nowhere to go

48
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159

 

49
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,149

so that's why i get there is a complete

50
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
so that's why i get there is a complete
 

51
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,070
so that's why i get there is a complete
contradiction all the time

52
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
contradiction all the time
 

53
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,390
contradiction all the time

54
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
so don't worry when you get blocked
 

55
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,910

it's like the nicu

56
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
it's like the nicu
 

57
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,910
it's like the nicu
does the person give up because the

58
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
does the person give up because the
 

59
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,109
does the person give up because the
wrist is hurting so they blend

60
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
wrist is hurting so they blend
 

61
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,109
wrist is hurting so they blend
the same way as this one doesn't hurt so

62
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
the same way as this one doesn't hurt so
 

63
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,270
the same way as this one doesn't hurt so
he builds up the opposite way and he

64
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
he builds up the opposite way and he
 

65
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,130
he builds up the opposite way and he
gets stronger

66
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,140

 

67
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,710
