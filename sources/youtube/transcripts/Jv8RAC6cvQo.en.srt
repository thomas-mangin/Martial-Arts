hip rotation shoulder strength okay it's
 

25
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,950
hip rotation shoulder strength okay it's
more angles boom right up this middle

26
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
more angles boom right up this middle
 

27
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,670
more angles boom right up this middle
boom right through this side but your

28
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:42,680
