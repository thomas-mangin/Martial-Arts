1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:02,660
I heard it from Yasuno Sensei,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,660
I think I have a reputation at the Aikikai,

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,660
of someone who won't take any hassle. (Laughs)

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,500
How did you start Aikido?

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,340
I started Aikido

6
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,800
when I was 15 and a half years old

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,220
at the Tokyo Aikikai.

8
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,420
I knew nothing about Aikido.

9
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,880
I was from the French countryside.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,460
I had never even seen Judo.

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,140
When I arrived in Japan,

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,550
the first night, there was a small party at my brother's place

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,300
and all the French people who were at the Aikikai at the time were present.

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,560
The next day my brother said to me:

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,080
"You need a visa to stay in Japan"

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,970
"What do you want to do?"

17
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,620
"You can do Ikebana"

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,010
"Karate, Naginata, Aikido..."

19
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,300
For me, all these words were gibberish,

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,200
I didn't know what all that was.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,300
I told him:

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,659
"The people who came to your party yesterday,"

23
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,859
"What do they do?"

24
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,450
He said, "They do Aikido."

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,689
I said, "Well, that's it then."

26
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,789
He said, "OK you'll see."

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,810
The next day I found myself on the tatami

28
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,259
and Christian Tissier, whom I had met him the day before,

29
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,630
made me do my first class

30
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,730
because it was he who had to take care of foreigners at the Aikikai.

31
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,350
So for an hour, he took care of me,

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,210
as a complete beginner.

33
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,229
After that,

34
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,529
I went to the beginners class on the first floor of the Aikikai.

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,610
I did two months as a beginner.

36
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,839
Then I went upstairs

37
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,259
with everyone else

38
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,159
on the second floor of the Aikikai.

39
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,909
I continued

40
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,009
So I had to practice every day [for my visa].

41
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,309
It was a bit difficult because of course,

42
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,869
I understood nothing at first,

43
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:25,389
and as I said, I had never seen anything like that before.

44
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:26,649
I was very athletic,

45
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:29,759
but I didn't know nothing at all about martial arts.

46
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,669
At the time, the class that suited me best was Masuda Sensei's

47
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:37,780
because it was quite simple, the techniques he presented were quite simple

48
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:42,740
and I found him very friendly.

49
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:47,249
I think that my current Aikido has been inspired by these people

50
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:49,719
with whom I started, people who were smiling.

51
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,799
Masuda Sensei was smiling all the very time,

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,900
he greeted people with a smile,

53
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,380
he was very warm.

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,000
This is what I like about him,

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,579
and that's what I liked about Yamaguchi Sensei,

56
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,129
who was also friendly and smiling all the time.

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,360
It's true that at the time,

58
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:12,899
I avoided the Sensei who were too strict,

59
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:14,599
whom I appreciated thereafter

60
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,049
but at the time I needed something

61
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,520
that made me want to go there,

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
and those people

63
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,369
have made me want to do Aikido.

64
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:29,049
You could have changed your visa, why did you stick with Aikido?

65
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,749
It's true that I could have had another activity

66
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:35,549
but I have a temperament such as

67
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,029
when I start something,

68
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:40,719
I must have a result in what I'm doing.

69
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,909
I'm not able to start something

70
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,480
and be mediocre in what I do.

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,760
I need to know a little bit,

72
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,349
to deepen practice, whatever it is,

73
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,820
to reach a certain level in order to realize what it is.

74
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,450
Since I was doing Aikido,

75
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,479
and because of my temperament,

76
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,499
I wanted to understand why French people, when they got out of practice,

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,440
used to say, "Oh, it's great"

78
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,120
I hadn't that feeling,

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,819
so I thought it was because I was a beginner,

80
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,889
and that I had to progress

81
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:15,070
in order to have the same ecstasy and experience

82
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,650
that something was happening there.

83
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,169
Indeed it happened because

84
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,789
I eventually loved it and so I continued because

85
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,590
I felt there was something to discover in this discipline.

86
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,009
How was everyday life in Japan?

87
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,820
My everyday life was very simple.

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,780
I resumed my studies upon returning to France

89
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,039
but in Japan, obviously, I was not going to school.

90
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,439
I went to a Japanese school,

91
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,479
and I was studying Japanese daily.

92
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,889
Every morning I had 3 hours of Japanese.

93
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,120
Afterwards, often, I went home.

94
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,669
I lived in a Japanese family.

95
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,490
The lady was very very nice,

96
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,189
and so,

97
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,069
without telling me each time,

98
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,460
she used to prepare me something to eat,

99
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,020
and when I got home at any time of day,

100
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,200
there was always something to eat on the stove...

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,980
She was very motherly towards me.

102
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,120
When I hanged my laundry, she would

103
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,810
re-hang it, and I would find it ironed on my bed

104
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,979
She acted like a mother with me.

105
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:32,059
We very often spent the afternoon

106
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,559
with a dictionary in the middle,

107
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,179
and she would teel me about her life,

108
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,100
with her husband, and this, and that,

109
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,220
the stories of a Japanese family's life.

110
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,919
It was very interesting because all the vocabulary that I didn't learn in school,

111
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,379
I learned with her because I wanted to know.

112
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,909
It was pretty nice.

113
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,339
I also had friends.

114
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,360
Initially I had a friend from China,

115
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,309
and we would go to the movies together,

116
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:07,209
she didn't understand the Japanese and me either, at first.

117
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,349
We laughed together, we had made Japanese friends,

118
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,349
we went to the cinema, we did not understand, but it was nice,

119
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,740
we visited Tokyo.

120
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,820
We were a bunch of girls and we had fun.

121
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,279
It was pretty cool because I was young.

122
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,299
There was also the whole French family

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,560
there were all the French friends who were there.

124
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,919
Whenever my brother was doing something, or when there were parties,

125
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,619
inevitably, I was invited.

126
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,279
It was pretty cool.

127
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Frankly, I enjoyed life in Japan.

128
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Did you experience any difficulty?

129
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:46,249
I must admit that at first it was not easy every day.

130
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,689
It was a big change compared to France and to be cut off suddenly

131
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,520
from my family,

132
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,030
it wasn't easy every day.

133
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,590
At the time, there were virtually no foreigners.

134
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,380
There were no blondes with blue eyes and very long hair.

135
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,039
They were only on magazines and on television.

136
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,050
It was a little bit special, I arrived in a country I did not know,

137
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,449
I was young,

138
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,490
everywhere people wanted to touch my hair because

139
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,949
for them it was something unusual.

140
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:18,139
I was offered haircuts for free.

141
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,629
I was offered to do photos.

142
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:24,329
I could actually have fallen into bad things,

143
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,460
because there were all kinds of proposals.

144
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,009
I think I was someone quite serious,

145
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,910
I knew what I wanted and what I didn't want.

146
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,849
It was quite surprising when I walked down the street,

147
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,220
I arrived at a street corner and children shouted gaijin! gaijin! gaijin!

148
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,840
It was a bit special and I had a little trouble in getting used to it

149
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,660
because at first, I wondered why they did that, I didn't understand.

150
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,680
What was surprising also is that every night,

151
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,509
when I went home,

152
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,789
for example when we went out and we came back later,

153
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,609
even though my brother had told me, "Here you do not risk anything",

154
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,060
every night there was someone who was taking me home.

155
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,920
In the train, there was always someone who wanted to speak with me in English, nicely,

156
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,040
and that person would walk me home.

157
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,789
At the beginning, I was a little worried, I thought: "What does he want?"

158
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:13,539
"Why is he following me".

159
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,819
Then I got used to it. They were very kind,

160
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,389
they just wanted to talk.

161
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,369
That was that.

162
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,520
They walked me home.

163
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,160
It was a bit strange.

164
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,179
Did you ever consider settling in Japan for good?, I would not have minded

165
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:32,239
Of course, I would not have minded at all to live in Japan.

166
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,460
At some point of our married life with Christian,

167
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,820
Yamaguchi Sensei was getting old,

168
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,800
so we thought of going back to live in Japan.

169
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,980
Christian wanted to benefit from his teaching a bit more.

170
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,139
He asked me about it, even though we already had 2 children,

171
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,680
he asked me,

172
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,420
and I accepted straight away.

173
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,200
It's a country that I have always loved.

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,920
Something happens each time I come back to Japan,

175
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,560
I feel like I come back

176
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,030
in a place that I loved as a child.

177
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,730
I feel like that I am coming back home each time.

178
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,850
It's quite bizarre, because I came here very young,

179
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,740
so as soon as I arrive in Tokyo, I hear the noises,

180
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,470
I feel like I'm coming home.

181
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,520
It's a country where I feel very good.

182
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,020
It's a sort of home away from home for me.

183
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,060
You were young when you came to Japan, did the country influence the adult that you have become?

184
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,540
I don't think that it had a particular influence.

185
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,660
Aikido had an influence.

186
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,800
It is it as a whole, Japan and Aikido.

187
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
I think that it's Aikido practice that had an influence on my life.

188
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,220
It shapes one's character,

189
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,040
even if one has that character to begin with,

190
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,740
everyone has their own character.

191
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,130
Before coming to Japan,

192
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,370
I had done a lot of athletics, I was very fit,

193
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,330
so already knew sports at a high level.

194
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,580
I had attended the

195
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,820
Font-Romeu sports high school.

196
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,220
For those who would become professionals.

197
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,530
So I had experienced intense training.

198
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,920
Training was very hard at the Aikikai.

199
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,930
When I started, it was very hard,

200
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,960
but somehow I could bear it because

201
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,900
I had already experienced that style of training.

202
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,310
It was totally different

203
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,620
but it was hard on the body.

204
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,720
When one begins at the Aikikai,

205
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,610
as I told you in a previous interview,

206
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,250
they make you walk on your knees for an hour until you get it right.

207
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,870
For Europeans, it's very hard to walk on the knees like that.

208
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,360
I see with my own students,

209
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,990
when make them do shikko for 10 minutes, they hurt everywhere.

210
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,270
My mind has to take over.

211
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,770
I had to do it or to lose my visa.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,620
One must have the strength of character

213
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,210
to take it and keep on learning.

214
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,900
So of course it shapes one's spirit,

215
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,260
it's obvious,

216
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,840
but it's not especially Japan, it's a whole.

217
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,340
I have been practicing for 40 years,

218
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,860
I know few people who have 40 years of practice

219
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,950
and who aren't hurting everywhere.

220
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,329
Sometimes it's the shoulders,

221
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:27,320
sometimes the knees.

222
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,060
For me it's the knees.

223
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,680
It came insidiously

224
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,480
but when it broke, it broke completely.

225
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,100
So I feel handicapped.

226
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,590
As you saw today, I can't kneel down.

227
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,380
I couldn't bow on my knees.

228
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,780
What is a bit of a shame is that

229
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,260
it is now that I feel at my best,

230
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,900
technically, because I feel good in my technique,

231
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,940
I feel good in my Aikido,

232
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,590
and that's where I feel limited,

233
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,400
because I am no longer able to do what I want to do.

234
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,730
At same time however, it's a challenge,

235
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,110
because I have to make do with what I have,

236
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,060
therefore,

237
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,080
since I know the technique well,

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,820
I try to do it relative to my handicap.

239
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,610
It's a new challenge,

240
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,730
and at same time, it's a new way to approach the technique.

241
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,990
It opens new doors.

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,580
Without doing it on purpose,

243
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,940
I try to do things a little differently because of my knees,

244
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,310
and eventually, I open new doors that I wasn't aware of initially.

245
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,830
It's wonderful, Aikido is really wonderful.

246
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,500
It's never over, there are always new doors to open.

247
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,410
The limitation opens a new way,

248
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,800
a new way to perform the technique...

249
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,100
And that's great!

250
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,200
3 or 4 years ago, I had a shoulder problem

251
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,700
- I still have it, but let's say at the moment it's muted, it does not hurt me -

252
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,790
one of my tendons is partly severed;

253
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,160
and that too has changed the way I do things.

254
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,500
I had to find other ways
because I could not raise my arm.

255
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,910
I managed to do my technique differently

256
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,670
but at the same time I realized that

257
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,500
I did not know I could do it that way.

258
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,000
It is infinite! And it's really great!

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,340
In hindsight, would you do anything differently?

260
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,800
It is clear that if I had to do it all again,

261
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,360
I would do as much Aikido,

262
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,720
but I wouldn't do other things I did next to it.

263
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,100
I would do less.

264
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,240
Every morning at sunrise,
I felt the need to do sport;

265
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,100
I was going for a run...

266
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
If I had to redo it,

267
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,480
I would avoid jogging because it damaged my knees.

268
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I also did a lot of dancing...

269
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,560
In dance there are a lot of pins, lots of jumps;

270
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,490
maybe I would do it differently if I had to do it again.

271
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,220
I would avoid some things, like jumps, etc.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,200
After that, other things
brought me tremendously in my Aikido

273
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,800
The practice of Karate, for example -.12 years of Karate -

274
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,500
it's one of the things that I wouldn't erase, because

275
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,000
I think what makes me stand out in Aikido,

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,690
is my experience in Karate.

277
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,500
Maybe my Aikido will be
edgier

278
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,100
than someone who has not done any, because

279
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,400
I also see the openings

280
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,630
for kicks

281
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,500
and punches

282
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
that I learned in Karate,

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
So, it's very important.

284
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,850
So that, I wouldn't erase.

285
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,600
But apart from that,

286
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,100
there are things that I would avoid.

287
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,000
re there things that you discourage your students from doing?

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,800
Absolutely.

289
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,500
Of course, I urge young people

290
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,900
those who want to become professionals,

291
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,920
or at least Aikido teachers,

292
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,300
to preserve themselves.

293
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,800
I stop them a little, especially with regard

294
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
the work on the knees;

295
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,660
I make sure they save themselves up a little.

296
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,530
And above all, I tell them not to fall for nothing.

297
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,400
When young, break falls are kind of magical,

298
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,300
and sometimes we do them for nothing:

299
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,430
someone throws us and we do break falls automatically.

300
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,000
So I tell them constantly:

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,390
"Don't fall,"

302
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,200
"don't take high ukemi unless you have to"

303
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,980
"do a normal fall, a small backwards roll"

304
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
"because you will regret it"

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,060
"in 10, 20 years, you will regret it, so"

306
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,220
"calm down!"

307
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,500
"don't fall"

308
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,510
"if you don't have to fall, don't fall".

309
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,750
"However, if someone throws you, go for it."

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,710
"Save it for when it gets harder!"

311
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,900
Yes, for sure,

312
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,900
I try to give them advice in the right direction.

313
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,760
After that, do they follow them, I don't know (laughter)... not always...

314
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,940
Do you see yourself in different generations of students?

315
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,900
Obviously!

316
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,360
What we just talked about ...

317
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
For example,

318
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,640
the fact of taking high falls,

319
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,300
to go for it, to hold nothing back...

320
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Necessarily,

321
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,380
I was like that at the same age!

322
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,700
Necessarily there are similarities.

323
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,600
And that is why we, being older, higher ranked,

324
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,400
we see the mistakes we've made

325
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,800
so we see ourselves in our student's work, it's obvious.

326
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,200
We all go through the same steps,

327
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,600
it's pretty funny actually.

328
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,700
1st Dan, we're a little shy

329
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,200
2nd Dan, we say: "Come on, I can go for it!"

330
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,499
we feel we can break everything...

331
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,239
3rd Dan, even more...

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,360
And like that at every stage...

333
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,339
After, there is a time when we calm down,

334
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,600
we become more serene,

335
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,860
we're a more detached relative to that.

336
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,770
But of course we see ourselves in the students!

337
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,270
How did you realize you wanted to become an Aikido teacher?

338
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,000
In fact, Christian did not offer me immediately

339
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,920
I don't know why,

340
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,800
perhaps because I was his wife and he just didn't think about it.

341
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,800
- It is not because he didn't want...

342
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,320
On the other hand

343
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,619
it came to me

344
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,610
at one point

345
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,880
- I think when I started -

346
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,319
- I was 4th Dan -

347
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,040
I think at some point,
everything we were given,

348
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,230
all we have learned,

349
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,880
all we have stored,

350
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,460
at one point

351
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,070
we want to give back.

352
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,000
And it is true that

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,440
when I was practicing as a student,

354
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,140
people frequently asked me: "correct me if it's no good";

355
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,850
Now, on this particular point, I remained very much into

356
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,300
the "Japanese system", that is to say:

357
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
when a sensei is there,

358
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,000
one doesn't correct others aside.

359
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,930
So I answered, "No, no, no."

360
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,900
"Christian is the Sensei, he will correct you";

361
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,300
"it's not my role."

362
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,470
And people didn't understand.

363
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,530
All the teaching that I did not want to do like that aside,

364
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,000
because it shouldn't happen,

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,530
I realized that the day I was able to teach,

366
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,500
it was like an open book inside me.

367
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,440
All I had learned...

368
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,100
I wondered where I was getting it from.

369
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,659
I had explanations that came
very naturally

370
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:27,960
for everything;

371
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,500
I could answer any
question,

372
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,310
for me it was clear, it was neat...

373
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,700
Yet I had never taught.

374
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,200
But in my head it was very clear.

375
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,500
All I had stored up,

376
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I wanted to share it with students.

377
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,100
For me it was normal.

378
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,580
It was a natural progression.

379
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,020
I think at some point we want to

380
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,100
give to others what we have learned.

381
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,420
Do you teach differently compared the way you learned in Japan? I think it's a big respo

382
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,310
Yes, that's obvious.

383
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,800
Everyone knows that in Japan,

384
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,410
they demonstrate the technique but don't explain it at all.

385
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,220
Without necessarily

386
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,800
talking for 40 min per class,

387
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,600
we explain the technique - as I did today -

388
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,179
When I see that people do not follow - and today I held back a little -

389
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,720
- because it's special -

390
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,400
in a normal class, I explain something;

391
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
if people can't do it,

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,950
I give them the keys to do so.

393
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
And all these keys,

394
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,960
that I was given,

395
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,000
all those little things that make people succeed in the technique,

396
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I find it normal to share them.

397
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,900
Christian gave me a lot of keys but not all of them;

398
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,970
there are some that I found myself.

399
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,300
It is important that I convey what I found.

400
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,510
I think it's logical.

401
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,000
Often at the end of a seminar, people say to me

402
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,600
"It's great : you explain for beginners
you explain for advanced people,"

403
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,700
"everyone understands what you want to do"...

404
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
But I think it is normal.

405
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,400
They shouldn't thank me for it

406
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
it's my job to do that.

407
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,700
It is normal that I share all that I was given

408
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,500
and I that explain the techniques as well as I can.

409
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Do you feel a sense of responsibility?

410
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes of course.

411
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I think it's a big responsibility to teach.

412
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,860
Talking about today's class,

413
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,300
4 years ago,

414
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,480
when I did my first class at the congress,

415
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,900
Christian was present.

416
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,500
It was the first time in my life I was teaching in front of him.

417
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
I don't know how many people were there, 600 maybe ...

418
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,500
I was afraid of one thing :

419
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,800
that he wouldn't be happy with what I was doing.

420
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,600
I didn't see the 600 people; they didn't scare me...

421
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,630
It was the fact that my Sensei was there,

422
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,800
that he was looking at me,

423
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,200
and he could have said after:

424
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,500
"It's good / not good."

425
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,440
There, I was a little bit scared ...

426
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,700
There was Christian Tissier on one side

427
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
and Osawa Sensei at the other end of the room.

428
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,380
They were both camped with arms crossed.

429
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,380
I had a lot of pressure!

430
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
But only because of the presence of 2 people in the room,

431
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,500
not because there were 600 around me.

432
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,590
It's incredible !

433
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,400
After all these years, do you consider Christian Tissier as your teacher?

434
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,500
Yes.

435
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,700
I think it is important to have a Sensei to follow...

436
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
even if he is my ex-husband. There is no problem,

437
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
for me he is my Sensei.

438
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,690
When he tells me something, I take it into account.

439
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,519
Whenever he says "this won't do" or "that's good"

440
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,880
I try to improve myself.

441
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,000
Until now he has not say it was wrong, so I'm OK (laughs)

442
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,890
It is true that it is a pressure for me :

443
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,890
when he is here, I'm always afraid of making a mistake.

444
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,080
I think I am not the only one to feel that way.

445
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,500
I will not name anybody but you can ask others,

446
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,080
I think they have the same pressure as me when Christian is around.

447
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,600
Do you teach the same way when Christian Tissier is here to watch?

448
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,470
Absolutely. Oh yes, today, for example, I did a class

449
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,700
that I have already done in other seminars,

450
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,450
because it's my way.

451
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,450
I have a little pressure before I step on the mat because he is there,

452
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,400
but once I'm on the mat, I'm home made, in my element,

453
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
it's my life...

454
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,600
My teaching takes precedence over the rest.

455
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,980
I am so comfortable in what I do,

456
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,000
that I forget everything that is happening around.

457
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,940
Only what I have to do becomes important to me;

458
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,940
I try to do the best I can.

459
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,380
Is there a point when you thought: "Now I can do thing on my way"?

460
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,620
It's not so much "I allow myself to do something else"

461
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,400
than a point one thinks...

462
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,060
actually, it comes naturally,

463
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,500
we discover other ways to do things.

464
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,380
I call that "applications":

465
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,140
suddenly, for a technique that you have been doing for 30 years,

466
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,060
you tell yourself :

467
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,180
"But it can also be done like this, it also works!"

468
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,100
In fact, it all comes naturally.

469
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,180
It's not :"I can do it".

470
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,120
You are doing something and suddenly...

471
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,310
actually...

472
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,230
I'll give an example:

473
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,000
I teach seminars frequently,

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I go abroad, I sometimes find myself with people

475
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,370
who are quite large and quite strong

476
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,669
and the technique that I've been doing for 30 years does not work

477
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,170
because they are too large, too beefy...

478
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,370
And there,

479
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,390
suddenly there is something else that comes out.

480
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,500
Because I can't do my technique as usual,

481
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,200
I'll take another route

482
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,170
and suddenly an application appears...

483
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
And that's really interesting, because

484
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,480
things are always different,

485
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,900
at each seminar,

486
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,000
there aren't the same people...

487
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,500
You have to face that every time,

488
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,070
and this is where, in fact,

489
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,000
we see if our technique works or not.

490
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,600
If, when doing my technique, what I try to do doesn't work at all,

491
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,760
and I don't have a "spare wheel"

492
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,200
that means that my technique isn't good,

493
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,280
that I don't really understand what I'm doing.

494
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,700
However, if we know that a technique isn't immutable,

495
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,000
that there is always a way to move elsewhere,

496
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the technique will work,

497
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
because we will deviate and an application will be born.

498
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,870
And there, suddenly, we say :

499
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,950
"I've been doing this technique for so many years"

500
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,950
"but I never suspected that I could also do it like that"

501
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,260
That's what's magic about Aikido...

502
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,440
Christian Tissier told me that some of his students got stuck in one phase of his evolution, did you?

503
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,030
It's very funny, because

504
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,870
when I was a student,

505
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,730
when Yamaguchi Sensei was still alive,

506
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,870
we would see him 2 to 3 times per year.

507
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,870
Often, Christian was happy because he realized that,

508
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,870
even if he did not see him every day,

509
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,440
he was following his path :

510
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,610
in the forms of the techniques, etc.

511
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,600
It's a bit the same for me :

512
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
even if I'm not working with Christian,

513
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,300
I realize that

514
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm always in his form,

515
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,580
I'm following

516
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,000
his evolution...

517
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,580
And often it has manifested itself in the past,

518
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,090
for example, a few years back,

519
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,740
- 15 years ago -

520
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,130
we had a dojo in Nice.

521
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,130
Sometimes I was teaching during lunch and Christian during the evening.

522
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We did not see each other between the classes.

523
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,500
For lunch, I was doing a class and Christian was doing the same thing at night.

524
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,830
And the students would tell me :

525
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,100
"Did Christian ask you to do that class at noon? Because you did the same thing"

526
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
I answered : "No, not at all."

527
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,900
It was just that I started this class,

528
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,270
and naturally,

529
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,730
it unrolled like this...

530
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,900
and Christian being my Sensei, obviously,

531
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,290
at one point,

532
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,280
our ideas converged.

533
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,810
It's still like that today,

534
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,310
I hardly train because I can't roll,

535
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:18,130
but often I watch Christian's courses,

536
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,900
and his logic is similar to mine,

537
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,900
so that makes me very happy.

538
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,480
Did other teachers influence you?

539
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,890
Influenced, no. Because it's true that I followed

540
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,360
mainly Christian.

541
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,500
Then, of course, I saw many other Sensei,

542
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I follow the classes of all Sensei who came to France,

543
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
but I can't say I was influenced by them

544
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
because I only see them occasionally.

545
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,500
Obviously there are plenty of Sensei I like,

546
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,290
but it's not them who influenced me.

547
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,290
The one who influences me is Christian, obviously.

548
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:01,270
You once told me that your main duty was to teach Christian Tissier's Aikido, do you still feel the same way?

549
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,870
Yes, I realize that more than ever.

550
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,400
I have a duty...

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,940
I have a background, I was given...

552
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,400
I am Christian Tissier's ex-wife, so I'm named after him.

553
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,960
It's true that sometimes it's an advantage,

554
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,030
but at the same time it's a responsibility for me

555
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,700
because everywhere I go

556
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,340
I have no room for error,

557
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,900
even less so than the others.

558
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
If others make a mistake, people will say: "OK, they made a mistake"

559
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
But if I make a mistake, I'm called Tissier;

560
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
so it's a big load on my shoulders...

561
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,840
I really have no room for error,

562
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,930
I know that whatever I do,

563
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,059
not only

564
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,470
people will talk about it,

565
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,200
but in addition, I'll be accountable to my Sensei,

566
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,400
he'll tell me: "But what did you do?"

567
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Somehow, I am accountable

568
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,299
because I have the same name, so

569
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:01,850
yes, it's a big burden for me.

570
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,880
I realize it and it is true that

571
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,639
it forces me

572
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:08,500
to be careful about what I'm doing,

573
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,800
to try to do the best I can,

574
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,230
to be always correct in what I do...

575
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,990
And it's true that I try not to deviate too far from...

576
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,560
I was going to say: "the basic technique".

577
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,840
I obviously do applications: I have applications that are mine,

578
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,160
that Christian does not do,

579
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,470
but I try to stay within

580
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,310
the basic technique that Christian taught me.

581
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,110
And I think that it goes further than that :

582
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,400
I think that we, the students of Christian,

583
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
are here precisely to teach the basics

584
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,760
to the people,

585
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,540
students, aikidokas

586
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,590
so that

587
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,610
when Christian comes to do a course,

588
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,549
people can understand

589
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,810
the "advanced" material that he shows

590
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,450
because they understood the basics with us.

591
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,450
I think it's important

592
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,400
to do that.

593
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Often when the opposite happens...

594
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,810
For example, Christian is teaching somewhere,

595
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,780
and he shows things that are a bit difficult.

596
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,780
When I go there afterwards people tell me :

597
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,300
"Christian came, he did this, this and this,"

598
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,980
"we didn't understand."

599
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,980
"Could you explain it differently"

600
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,759
"why he did it and where he was going?"

601
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:27,400
It's my job too,

602
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,500
to go ahead of him,

603
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,200
and say : "I'll do that, so that you understand what Christian wants to do when he comes"

604
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,780
or the opposite, when I go after him and they did not understand,

605
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,100
to show the basic techniques for people to understand where he wanted to go.

606
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,250
It happens quite often.

607
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,000
Did you consider loosing the name "Tissier" to gain more freedom?

608
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,500
I have never been tempted, but I think it would change nothing.

609
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,500
For the people I am Micheline Tissier, Micheline Vaillant-Tissier or just Micheline Vaillant,

610
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
but it changes nothing.

611
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,300
I think in people's heads, I am the ex-wife of Christian Tissier

612
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,710
and I represent Tissier technique.

613
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,710
So even if I wanted to, I think it would not change the problem:

614
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,700
psychologically I would have the same load on my shoulders

615
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,000
and I would say to myself the same things,

616
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that I have to do things well because I represent

617
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,190
the school of Christian Tissier...

618
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,190
It wouldn't change anything.

619
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,370
Do you encourage your students to cross-train in other martial arts?

620
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,300
I don't encourage them,

621
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,300
not immediately. I think we need to have a certain level

622
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,500
before going somewhere else, because

623
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,300
the big problem is that if you start too soon to do another activity,

624
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,720
you get mixed up in the forms,

625
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,230
everything merges and nothing good comes out.

626
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,909
So I think

627
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:56,500
you must already have a good background in Aikido, a 3rd or 4th Dan,

628
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,440
to have well integrated all forms in Aikido,

629
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,000
and then you can afford to go do something else.

630
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,700
Like that, it is a plus for your own practice.

631
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,040
It can be tempting to find answers elsewhere when they are too hard to find within Aikido...

632
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,490
Absolutely, this is exactly it.

633
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,389
That's why, I wouldn't recommend it to my students.

634
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:19,529
That said, some do it anyway, there are some who do Karate in parallel

635
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,400
but I do not encourage it. One can't be good at everything, so...

636
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,500
If I advise someone to do something, it is as a complement,

637
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,510
not to do 2 activities in parallel ;

638
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,460
it's hard to do 2 activities in parallel,

639
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,610
because if one wants to become "good",

640
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,410
a certain number of hours have to be spent each week

641
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,410
and in this case, there is no time to do 2 activities.

642
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,410
So I do not advise it

643
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,630
until one has a sufficient background...

644
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,450
Really, one life is not enough

645
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,600
to do all the things we should

646
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,620
to be proficient in one's discipline.

647
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,720
One should do some Judo, some Ju-Jutsu

648
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,770
some boxing, to find all openings and

649
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,770
to excel in one's own activity.

650
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,730
The Aikido population shrinks and gets older, haw can we retain beginners in Aikido?

651
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,090
Yesterday during the forae, we spoke about women,

652
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,369
but also about children... how to attract teenagers, and so on...

653
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:23,980
I have many in my teenagers in my dojos

654
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,400
I always have a class with about 20 teenagers.

655
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,440
And some of those teenagers

656
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,850
started Aikido at age 8,

657
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,250
and when they arrived at the age of 16 they are told to take a shodan exam.

658
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,120
It's their first exam, and for them, it's important...

659
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,230
But some of my 16 years old girls were failed by the jury.

660
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,800
I went to the jury and I said :

661
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,700
"What happened, didn't they do well?"

662
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,960
They answered : "No, technically it was fine."

663
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,270
I said, "That's what Shodan is about right?"

664
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,590
They said: "There were no technical errors"

665
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,200
"but they were not mature enough."

666
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,090
How can people progress like that?

667
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,590
How can we hope to retain Teenagers if we do that?

668
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,700
If you already put a barrier like that at Shodan?

669
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,100
These little girls, they quit Aikido.

670
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,590
For me, it was obvious they were going to quit Aikido.

671
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,250
They had been doing Aikido from the age of 8.

672
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,000
We brought them to Shodan, and they were told: "No black belt for you"

673
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
"You won't get it because"

674
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,440
"You are not mature enough."

675
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,740
This is nonsense!

676
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,020
When we have children who are in

677
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,020
a club since the age of 8 to 10 years old

678
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,160
we should be able to give them the Shodan

679
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,400
so they will want to continue Aikido.

680
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,940
That's how we could have people stick with Aikido,

681
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,620
basically.

682
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,600
However, there...

683
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,549
In some meetings with people who judge

684
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:44,140
Shodan examinations,

685
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,920
I said, "Wait, children - I mean youngsters who are around 16 years old -"

686
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,000
"unless their performance is really catastrophic,"

687
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,700
"you have to pass them."

688
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,170
They should be encouraged; we should give it to them.

689
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,000
This is what will move things forward.

690
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,200
This is what will make them want to continue :

691
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,980
the black belt.

692
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,500
What do you do in the the classes to appeal beginners?eone had told

693
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,279
During my courses, people often tell me that

694
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,629
there is something for everyone, including beginners.

695
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:15,189
Beginners come to me and tell me: "It's great!"

696
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:18,600
"For once we did an seminar were we felt included; we understood what you wanted to do"

697
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:20,679
"you put different levels of comprehension"

698
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,279
"in your way of teaching..."

699
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:25,229
I think we have to do this in the course.

700
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,229
Like many other teachers, in my club, I have two classes per week :

701
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,690
for 2 hours, 2 times a week,

702
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,329
I can't afford to have a classes with separate levels...

703
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,800
It is not possible! Everyone is together.

704
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,289
So, inevitably

705
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,100
I offer several levels in my teaching:

706
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,859
when I show the technique

707
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,859
I try to reach beginners - a bit like what I did today at some point :

708
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,829
"Beginners should understand that we pass by this step, then this step,"

709
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,269
"to get there."

710
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:54,939
I'm doing all this on several levels and after I say :

711
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:58,099
"Go ahead, each at his own level, do what you understand "

712
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,249
So people are very happy, because

713
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:04,349
everyone understands something, everyone takes something.

714
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,359
I do the same thing in my classes; I have to.

715
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,369
These are classes for all ranks, so there are beginners who just started,

716
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:14,000
who have two weeks Aikido,

717
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,279
as well as people with 20 years of practice; everything is mixed.

718
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:20,279
I don't have much choice.

719
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:20,779
One idea proposed during yesterday's Women forum was to separate men and women in different classes...

720
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,300
Personally, if someone had told me in Aikido: "This is a course exclusively for women"

721
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,509
I would not have continued Aikido.

722
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,879
That, I'm sure of because...

723
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,879
as I said at the forum :

724
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:42,330
when I was young, I was a little feisty...

725
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,519
maybe karate would have better suited me...

726
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,289
I wanted to do boxing, but we didn't want me...

727
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:51,729
I liked to fight so it's true that

728
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,500
if Aikido had offered to work only with women

729
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,349
it would not have suited me,

730
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:59,579
because someway, they are bit a fragile - not all of them of course -

731
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,800
- I had partners who were, very strong -

732
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,059
- which were real Budoka... -

733
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,789
I mean that the majority of women who come to Aikido

734
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:09,329
twice a week

735
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,500
approach it a bit like a gym.

736
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,560
I do not want to denigrate their interest in Aikido

737
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,899
nor that they develop through Aikido,

738
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:21,759
but in any case, initially, they are not coming

739
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:24,340
to get hurt or to hurt themselves,

740
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,789
and it is true that in Aikido

741
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:27,439
as in all Budo,

742
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:32,400
there is a point where, when we go full on, it hurts...

743
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,669
I did not like practicing with women, it is true.

744
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,269
When I practiced with them, I had to be very careful...

745
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:44,129
I was restraining myself all the time.

746
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:46,889
Because what I liked, actually,

747
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:50,239
at the beginning, when I was Shodan, was to fight.

748
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:52,829
So I had to fight

749
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,300
and it's true that it was often frowned upon

750
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,549
by my female partners,

751
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:59,549
so I didn't do it.

752
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:04,669
Is such intensity necessary to reach excellence?

753
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:07,739
Yes quite. And others share this view

754
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,449
Yoko [Okamoto] agrees with me, Janet [Clift] also...

755
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,670
High-ranking females

756
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,909
agree with what I said.

757
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,909
I think for those who have worked at a high level,

758
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,319
we have been forced to fight to get where we are,

759
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:26,339
we had to get through this anyway.

760
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:27,859
No one helped us out;

761
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,859
nobody gave us anything.

762
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,580
We know where we come from,

763
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,479
we know why we are here.

764
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:39,000
I know why I'm here.

765
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,519
And I think it is even harder for us...

766
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:45,839
For example: when I started giving courses,

767
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,939
I do know that some used to say :

768
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:52,369
"It's because it is the wife of Christian Tissier that she does seminars,"

769
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,040
"but OK then..."

770
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,039
And subsequently, I was being tested;

771
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,119
at each course, people had to test me...

772
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,249
Fortunately, in my practice,

773
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,479
I liked fighting and I had

774
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:08,700
that surly side because otherwise,

775
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,159
I'd never have made it.

776
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,159
And it's true that little surly side meant

777
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:18,500
that I got beaten up pretty bad at times.

778
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,739
When I practiced, I rarely

779
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,739
had the advantage at the time...

780
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,749
I was young; I was a little crazy in what I was doing,

781
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:29,690
but then once I got the technical level,

782
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,690
that side really served me well because

783
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:37,139
I didn't take any abuse.

784
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,399
And I understand that at the Aikikai, I have a bit of a reputation

785
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,750
- I learned it from Yasuno Sensei -

786
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,979
I think that at the Aikikai, I have the reputation of someone who does not give in. (laughs)

787
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,780
All female instructors who were chosen as teachers this week seem to share your views.

788
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,819
It's where we see the difference between

789
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:58,259
honorary and technical grades.

790
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:01,429
I think that's the big difference

791
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:04,539
between Japan and other countries.

792
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:07,299
Because people do not make the difference in our countries,

793
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:10,019
between honorary and technical grades but in Japan there is a big difference.

794
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,119
One who has a technical grade knows why,

795
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,119
and one who has an honorary one also knows why,

796
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:19,839
he never pretends to be a teacher. And that's a big problem here in the West.

797
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:24,139
We never say in France: "It's an honorary grade" or "It's a technical grade".

798
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:27,139
It doesn't exist ; they say: "This is a grade", that's all."

799
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,809
Already, from there, you can't tell the difference because nobody talks about it.

800
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,699
Aikido is supposed to make people better; does it?

801
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:40,869
This is not how

802
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:42,789
I would approach the problem...

803
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,789
It's true that after 40 years, I have lots of experience with students.

804
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,459
Not that it makes better,

805
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:50,289
but it helps people to progress in their life

806
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,079
in a positive way.

807
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,679
I think of specific cases of people

808
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,749
who came to Aikido, saying :

809
00:39:57,749 --> 00:40:01,329
"If ever I can get to the equivalent of a brown belt,"

810
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:02,269
"I will be happy"

811
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:05,289
These people have passed their 1st Dan, their 2nd Dan, their 3rd Dan...

812
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,429
But what was

813
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:09,149
very interesting for me

814
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:10,689
is that in their lives

815
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:13,069
they have progressed in the same way.

816
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:15,749
Those people managed

817
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,539
to do some very interesting things in their lives,

818
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:21,389
they rose in their job,

819
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,989
while they progressed in Aikido.

820
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,619
In the same manner that

821
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,569
they did not feel able, initially,

822
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:31,719
to become a black belt, for example,

823
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,069
they did not feel able to pass beyond a certain stage at work.

824
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:38,080
And that's really interesting because

825
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,329
we help people's progress

826
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:41,669
in their life.

827
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:44,579
With children, it is even more obvious.

828
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,409
I no longer teach children's classes

829
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:51,479
but when I used to, it was obvious.

830
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:54,829
For example : there were kids coming in,

831
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,509
who had not much respect, nor education...

832
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:01,839
Some were terrible so I thought:

833
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,669
"I'm going to tell parents that it won't do."

834
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:07,409
And when the parents came in,

835
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:08,379
I saw that they were worse than the kids.

836
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:11,099
So I thought that everything was up to me.

837
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:14,409
If the kid was to progress,

838
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:15,460
in everything he did,

839
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,480
it would have to be thanks to me.

840
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,089
I had to take the responsibility.

841
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:21,359
When after a year or two,

842
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,599
this child

843
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:25,819
became something other than what he was initially,

844
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,619
it made me feel really proud because I could say to myself :

845
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,429
"It's thanks to me that he become what he is."

846
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:33,449
Likewise, I have had cases

847
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,920
of kids who

848
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,649
were off track in their lives,

849
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:40,469
teens whose parents would call me and tell me :

850
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:43,509
"If someone can do something, it is you, because he sees only through you."

851
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:46,270
So, thanks to my advice,

852
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,609
with the direction I advised them to take...

853
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:53,159
Usually when I received such a call, I tried to take care

854
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,809
of these kids more than others,

855
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,769
to take them with me more, etc.

856
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:00,119
Suddenly, they were able to take completely different directions,

857
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,219
through Aikido.

858
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,449
And that, for a teacher of Aikido, it's super interesting.

859
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:10,200
This apsect of Aikido interests me very much.

860
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:14,400
Helping people advance in their lives,

861
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,459
especially children and teenagers,

862
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:18,459
it's super interesting,

863
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:22,400
showing them good directions...
