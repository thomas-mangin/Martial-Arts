00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
in this configuration so I want to get a
 

499
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,170
in this configuration so I want to get a
number of those right it's not quite

500
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,180
number of those right it's not quite
 

501
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,730
number of those right it's not quite
it's critical with this rotation that it

502
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:36,740
it's critical with this rotation that it
 

503
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,050
it's critical with this rotation that it
is with something like your shoulders so

504
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,060
is with something like your shoulders so
 

505
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,780
is with something like your shoulders so
you can do isometric exercises with your

506
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:40,790
you can do isometric exercises with your
 

507
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,360
you can do isometric exercises with your
arm too like so say I put a chair here

508
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,370
arm too like so say I put a chair here
 

509
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,370
arm too like so say I put a chair here
underneath my hand and then I push down

510
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,380
underneath my hand and then I push down
 

511
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,260
underneath my hand and then I push down
as hard as I can on the chair I'll only

00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,270
as hard as I can on the chair I'll only
 

513
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,000
as hard as I can on the chair I'll only
be isometrically only being a lot of

be isometrically only being a lot of
 

515
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,470
be isometrically only being a lot of
strength right in this range so I want

516
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
strength right in this range so I want
 

517
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,960
strength right in this range so I want
to change the different ranges as I

518
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:52,970
to change the different ranges as I
 

519
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,970
to change the different ranges as I
worked at isometrics not quite as

520
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:54,980
worked at isometrics not quite as
 

521
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,350
worked at isometrics not quite as
critical the way we were working it

522
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:56,360
critical the way we were working it
 

523
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,940
critical the way we were working it
right now because in truth you're really

right now because in truth you're really
 

525
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,320

00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,330
working that same group no matter where
 

527
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,570
working that same group no matter where
you're on the rotation but it gives us a

528
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:01,580
you're on the rotation but it gives us a
 

529
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,400
you're on the rotation but it gives us a
nice set to kind of work through which

530
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,410
nice set to kind of work through which
 

531
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:13,050

is good okay meditation guys okay so
observational meditation again I might

534
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,070
observational meditation again I might
 

535
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,050
observational meditation again I might
do a guided in the near future we'll see

536
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,060
do a guided in the near future we'll see
 

537
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,100
do a guided in the near future we'll see
because I've been doing this

538
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,110
because I've been doing this
 

539
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,350
because I've been doing this
observational I use it because this is

540
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
observational I use it because this is
 

541
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,790
observational I use it because this is
what I use for myself all the time it

542
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:24,800
what I use for myself all the time it
 

543
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,370
what I use for myself all the time it
it's the hardest for me in most ways

544
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:27,380
it's the hardest for me in most ways
 

545
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,980
it's the hardest for me in most ways
because

546
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:27,990
because
 

547
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,330
because
there's lots of little cool tricks and

548
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,340
there's lots of little cool tricks and
 

549
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,890
there's lots of little cool tricks and
meditation techniques you can use and

550
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,900
meditation techniques you can use and
 

551
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,840
meditation techniques you can use and
and sometimes neat fun stuff you can

552
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:32,850
and sometimes neat fun stuff you can
 

553
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,780
and sometimes neat fun stuff you can
explore in meditation which is cool but

554
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:35,790
explore in meditation which is cool but
 

555
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,000
explore in meditation which is cool but
to me the strictest hardest kind is just

556
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,010
to me the strictest hardest kind is just
 

557
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,190
to me the strictest hardest kind is just
observational meditation like this

558
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,200
observational meditation like this
 

559
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,870
observational meditation like this
where's you know I just stay present and

560
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:41,880
