1
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:40,040
How did you all meet and how does this common experience of Hombu unite you?

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:48,340
I joined the Hombu in April, 1975.

3
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:57,349
There were a lot of French people like Tissier Sensei back then.

4
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,019
I came from the Kyushu region,

5
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,690
so I hadn't seen many foreigners,

6
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,360
and it was like wow, this is so different.

7
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,238
Also, I’d only practiced with Japanese people

8
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:17,911
and the practice with the foreigners was really tough for me because they were taller and stronger.

9
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:25,002
At the Hombu, I trained with Tissier Sensei under Kisshomaru Sensei for about a year,

10
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:34,678
until he returned to France in 1976.

11
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:40,601
Regarding Okamoto Sensei, I think she arrived when I was live-in [instructor],

12
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,769
she came from France...

13
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,479
[Okamoto Yoko] It was in 1978.

14
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,439
1978...

15
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,273
1978

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,066
So that's definitely when I was living at Hombu.

17
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,568
[Okamoto Yoko] Yes, I started at Hombu.

18
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,615
I remember seeing her during Yamaguchi Sensei’s class.

19
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,076
Yes, around that time. It's only after that I went to France and came back.

20
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,579
Yes that's right.

21
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:07,044
I also remember Tissier Sensei training with a great variety of teachers,

22
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:14,426
starting with Kisshomaru Sensei from Monday to Sunday.

23
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,429
Yes, that's correct.

24
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,433
Yes, I don't have much to add to what he says but that's it.

25
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:26,355
Him and I met in 1975.

26
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:31,777
When he arrived from Kyushu, he had already some ranks.

27
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,405
He was very "lively" during practice.

28
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,367
I had a lot of pleasure practicing with him.

29
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,786
It was often a bit intense,

30
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,996
but those were the times.

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:48,877
Miyamoto Sensei, Shibata Sensei, Seki Sensei, Iwagaki Sensei, were there.

32
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,004
It was a very solid group.

33
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,674
I had a lot of pleasure training with them.

34
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,593
We had technique and we were young

35
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,471
so there was a sort of emulation between us.

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,976
For Yoko, it's a little bit different because we met before she started Aikido.

37
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,397
She studied French so we had some friends common.

38
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,317
It's along story.

39
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,655
She started Aikido after I left but we then met again in Paris.

40
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,199
She attended my dojo for a few years.

41
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,828
That is how life is.

42
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,455
In life, there are lots of opportunities to meet people.

43
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,291
Some are more important than others.

44
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,670
Some aren't important at the time while others are.

45
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,547
We can't foresee how things will turn out

46
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,342
but in the end, there is something that unites us, even though we don't know what it is.

47
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,929
At some point, it emerges again.

48
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,515
I have had that experience with many people.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,980
We have something in common, but we can't define it.

50
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,607
For us, it could be our love for Aikido.

51
00:03:52,774 --> 00:04:01,450
But with people like Miyamoto Sensei and Yoko, I think it is more of a heart connection.

52
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,578
On my part, I like the man.

53
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,955
I like what Yoko represents,

54
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,624
especially in a Japanese environment.

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,668
It must be difficult for her.

56
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,173
Things are difficult for women in Europe too, but here, it is even harder.

57
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,300
She's someone who found her place

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,597
and people give here that place because it's hers.

59
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,309
Miyamoto Sensei is very humble,

60
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,603
and very engaged in Aikido.

61
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,690
(I don't want to take too much time)

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,656
I think that what unites us even more among some Shihan

63
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,618
is our loyalty to the Ueshiba family.

64
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:49,039
I think that if Kisshomaru was still with us today,

65
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,166
he would be happy.

66
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:56,505
He would be happy to see that youngsters that he knew in their late teens

67
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,717
are still doing things together well into their 60's --67 for me---

68
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:07,265
with respect, joy, and, I hope, quality.

69
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,852
I started in 1978,

70
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,272
so that was about three years after Miyamoto Sensei came here.

71
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:21,112
Christian was already gone by the time I started,

72
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:29,204
but I went to his dojo for practice when I left for France to learn the language.

73
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:35,961
To go back to Guillaume’s question about what connects the three of us together,

74
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:42,384
of course, it is definitely like Christian said: our passion for Aikido, but there is more.

75
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:49,391
When I started, Miyamoto Sensei was an uchi deshi.

76
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:56,481
Miyamoto Sensei, Yokota Sensei, and Osawa Sensei were all uchi deshi.

77
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:03,697
They were considered the top three, the top three uchi deshi and we never dared to approach them. [laughs]

78
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:09,494
They are the ones who taught me everything.

79
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:16,918
And when I went to France, Christian taught me everything he learned at the Hombu Dojo.

80
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:25,886
We, the three generations including me, Christian, and Miyamoto Sensei,

81
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:31,308
attended practice sessions from every teacher there was,

82
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,025
and of course that of Doshu,

83
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,404
and it was completely different each day.

84
00:06:45,113 --> 00:07:03,131
We all learned Aikido by learning from all the different teachers and I think that is what connects us.

85
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:11,389
Of course we all had our favorite teachers,

86
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,726
as a human tendency, but we were all on the same boat called the Hombu,

87
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:23,193
as a human tendency, but we were all on the same boat called the Hombu.

88
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:30,825
I think that learning from every different teacher was a definite strength.

89
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:38,500
What is it that kept you together through all these years in spite of your parting ways and different practices?

90
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,129
Well,

91
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,301
Back in the 70's,

92
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,722
when Aikido wasn’t as prominent worldwide as today,

93
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,935
there were only one or two people per year that went abroad from the Hombu.

94
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:09,823
In the 90's however, we started getting requests to send instructors over.

95
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:22,460
And I think I started to come to France only in the past 15 years or so,

96
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,005
I started in the city of Lyon.

97
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:34,389
When I first came, Tissier Sensei came all the way to Lyon, and we ate together.

98
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,974
And from that point it happened agian afterwards.

99
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,854
When I was at the Hombu, I was Kisshomaru Sensei’s student first and foremost.

100
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:47,193
and I stayed there while he was promoting Aikido all over the world.

101
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:55,660
I think it was 15 years ago that I made it to France and was reunited with Tissier Sensei.

102
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:06,588
Okamoto Sensei also went to the US at some point to promote Aikido,

103
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:14,763
before she returned to Japan and taught at her dojo in Kyoto.

104
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:28,693
There were some French people among us, but I had the honor of being approached by them.

105
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,657
And that led to this friendship.

106
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:42,165
Hombu obviously has its own protocol and I couldn’t reach out to them myself.

107
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:47,337
We sometimes talk about the old days, specifically our practice.

108
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:53,968
I’m not going to drop name, but we were also attracted to the same Sensei.

109
00:09:54,344 --> 00:10:01,226
That’s how we formed this unique relationship, and I’m grateful for that.

110
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,273
What's important is that

111
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:15,740
in spite of different practices, our basics and the principles are the same.

112
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,702
It's the way we express them and teach people that differs.

113
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,210
What's interesting is to see how our students react.

114
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,880
I look at how my own students react.

115
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:42,517
When Miyamoto Sensei is in Lyon, or now that he come closer to my home in Puget when he has a bit of time,

116
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,021
my students want to attend.

117
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:57,657
The young ones, those who do a lot of Aikido, all get in a car and go there.

118
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:05,248
They are not concerned by our differences, for them, it is Aikido.

119
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:10,211
What's important is that the basics I gave them...

120
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,380
I often get back to basics, including during this seminar.

121
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:21,723
Yesterday I tried to do new things, even for me, while today, I showed basics, with an evolution.

122
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,393
If the basics are solid, we can read someone else's Aikido.

123
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,062
We have the keys to understand it.

124
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,398
That way we can see the more subtle aspects of the person.

125
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,484
We don't see it as "another style".

126
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,279
It's the same thing but interpretations can be different.

127
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,156
For Yoko, it's a little bit different

128
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,617
because we have been in permanent contact for a long time.

129
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:49,292
Every time she teaches in Scotland or in Germany, she comes to Paris if she has time.

130
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:54,255
We see each other for a day or two,

131
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,343
The ties that unite us are very strong.

132
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:03,431
I know well her family, her children so it's on a different level.

133
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:09,229
However, what pleases me is that

134
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:13,066
when Miyamoto Sensei goes to Argentina,

135
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,945
my Argentinian students go  because that's important for them.

136
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:22,033
Same when Yoko goes to Brazil or Argentina.

137
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,454
For people, after a point, it doesn't not make any difference.

138
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,873
We are happy to see everybody,

139
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,543
we don't have to go but we go if we want,

140
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,130
but we all belong to the same group.

141
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,260
People follow that group and I think it's great.

142
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:50,270
Of course I might get to see Miyamoto Sensei or Christian once in a while if I get the chance,

143
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:56,359
but obviously I don’t see them everyday.

144
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,570
But when I practice, which happens everyday,

145
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,908
I always see something that reminds me of them

146
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:10,248
like oh, I saw Christian do this, I saw MiyamotoSsensei do this,

147
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:17,797
he was also doing that at Hombu, so was Yasuno Sensei, and Yamaguchi Sensei and so on.

148
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:23,011
I see those personalities come out, different shades of Aikido come out all the time.

149
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,846
If I think about it,

150
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:30,393
I might get to see Miyamoto Sensei only every two months,

151
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:35,565
Christian once or twice a year,

152
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,818
but they are always in my head, every day.

153
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:44,574
o they are very close to me in that sense.

154
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,787
That is one thing.

155
00:13:49,996 --> 00:14:03,176
Even if we are physically very distant, I can always feel their presence.

156
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:18,483
And like Christian just said, I feel happy for my students to go to Miyamoto Sensei or Christian’s class.

157
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:25,448
I just want them to get the best training possible, including going to the Hombu.

158
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:37,460
Christian also mentioned this but I believe our role is to show them a variety of Aikido

159
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,882
and also teach them the basic skills so they can adapt to those different styles quickly.

160
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:55,186
Sorry I guess that was off topic, but anyways, yeah.

161
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,815
[Jordy Delage] It leads to the next question.

162
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,690
Oh the next question, really?

163
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:07,990
When I go to France, to Lyon, I can see Tissier Sensei’s students.

164
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,452
They take ukemi for me and it is a very good one.

165
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,581
Also, I see Yoko Sensei’s students at the Hombu, and they have a very good ukemi as well.

166
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:21,421
That assures me that they are receiving really good instruction.

167
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:27,051
I can tell by their ukemi without seeing their technique.

168
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,055


169
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:36,018
There are two ways to understand what "good ukemi" means.

170
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,021
Is is someone who know how to take break-falls?

171
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:47,071
Or is it someone who understand the connection during the movement?

172
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:54,579
It's important to highlight because who listen to the interview might misunderstand.

173
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:02,587
Our students who do "good ukemi" are not acrobats.

174
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:09,510
We want them to be present, fluid...

175
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,388
that they are compressed when they have to...

176
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,517
At same time, this connection must be felt.

177
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:21,439
I hope that the people who listen to this interview

178
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,526
understand that what we mean by "good ukemi" is not only doing break-falls

179
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,487
but it's how to establish a relationship with the person doing the technique...

180
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,899
[Guillaume Erard] To develop a sort of perception?

181
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:32,360
Absolutely, yes.

182
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,659
The outer form of your Aikido differs in spite of your common basics. Is it a manifestation of Shuhari?

183
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:45,505
Well, this Shuhari

184
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:59,602
Ukemi is a crucial part of practice.

185
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:09,570
It is the foundation of the technique, and it allows you to learn how to use your body.

186
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:18,120
Both sensei are doing a great job of teaching them that important aspect.

187
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:25,628
Hombu teachers like me can’t take direct students.

188
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,798
They are all Doshu Ueshiba Sensei's students.

189
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:35,513
Of course there is Shuhari

190
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:43,729
but the teacher who wants to instruct students has to navigate between those three states.

191
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:54,073
He might have achieved "Ri", the destructuring because he has internalized the principles,

192
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:59,370
but he must constantly go back to show the kata to the students.

193
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,916
Otherwise, he couldn't go further,

194
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,963
so he must constantly go back to the "Shu" of the construction of the kata.

195
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:13,092
We have no choice even sometimes we might do something else.

196
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,344
It's a bit of a trap for the teacher.

197
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:21,267
Sometimes, I don't teach the Aikido I'd like to do myself.

198
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,146
I teach the Aikido that you people need.

199
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,315
So we navigate between those states.

200
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:32,111
Sometimes, we no longer know where we are.

201
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,576
Sometimes we're a bit confused.

202
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,788
I think it's very important to understand those three states.

203
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,417
I define them as the kata, the form,

204
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:55,593
then, the kneading of the body, and then getting back to the kata

205
00:18:55,593 --> 00:19:01,515
and when all of this is done, the hips are made, the hands position is right,

206
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,226
the body can express itself,

207
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,647
but we need limits, that's why we need models.

208
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,775
It happened to me in my life as an Aikidoka.

209
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:20,743
I used to see Yamaguchi Sensei often but he also used to write to me for New Year.

210
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:26,123
One day, he wrote something to that effect:

211
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:42,556
"Happy New Year. Be careful, by doing too much sword, you risk to lose the principles."

212
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,020
I thought I wasn't doing a lot of sword to I wondered why he was saying that.

213
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:57,154
Then I thought that perhaps, my sword work was either too, or not rigid enough,

214
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,492
or perhaps too much based on form, or speed.

215
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:10,626
So I started to question myself and I deciced to leave the sword as a side thing.

216
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:16,132
I'm not a kenjutsu teacher, I'm an Aikido teacher.

217
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:24,890
By doing too much kata, perhaps he feared that my Aikido would become too rigid, I don't know.

218
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:37,278
So what's interesting is that we can be 6th, 7th, or even 8th Dan, but someone who was our model can still guide us.

219
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,490
"It's OK to go there a bit, but stop, come back a little".

220
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,285
We need that guidance.

221
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,581
We too give guidance to others.

222
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,625
That's our responsibility.

223
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:56,130
That also our legitimacy to say those things.

224
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:01,677
We have the legitimacy to say "this is OK, but until today only".

225
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,472
"You do it well until today, but from tomorrow, it must be something else".

226
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,558
"You are going too much in that direction, be careful".

227
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:14,982
That's why the term "Shihan" has a lot of meaning to me

228
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:23,908
because you are a model to others, but also to yourself.

229
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,995
A teacher navigates between all those things.

230
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,415
I don't know if you see things that way but I do.

231
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:38,672
To the question why is everyone still different even if they all receive the same instruction at Hombu,

232
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:44,345
That’s because everyone has their own personality.

233
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:51,227
In the context of Japanese tea lessons, we learn how to position our hands

234
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:59,902
and it must not be different even by a little.

235
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:08,911
And no matter how much you try to mold them into this, they will always show their personality.

236
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:15,876
Same with Aikido, regardless of how long we do the same practice,

237
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:23,384
you will see that person’s character and experiences.

238
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:34,478
So for me, we are all trying to achieve the same thing, but in different ways.

239
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:40,985
I’m not Miyamoto Sensei, Christian, Yamaguchi Sensei, Yasuno Sensei or anyone else,

240
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,988
so it’s impossible to do the same.

241
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:50,619
But how to achieve the same thing with the body that I have?

242
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,248
That’s the question that I have to think about and solve.

243
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:58,836
We are all different, origin, gender, body structure…

244
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,924
I think that’s why, that’s my answer to the first question.

245
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,094
And also, we talked about uke earlier.

246
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:13,017
What I think recently is, well Christian said that we have to explain in a way that’s easier for the audience to understand,

247
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:18,689
and you may think what is a good uke?

248
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,317
A good uke is not about taking an uke.

249
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:27,072
I think if you expect to take an ukemi, it’s not going to be a good ukemi.

250
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,785
There is tori and uke, and rather than just taking an ukemi,

251
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:50,095
you have to be able to instantly sense what is going on in the dynamic of the tori and uke through the technique.

252
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,767
I think that’s what a good uke is.

253
00:23:54,767 --> 00:24:02,650
Anyone can take an uke, especially if they’ve been doing Aikido for years,

254
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:14,036
but for both the uke and tori to learn, you have to go beyond that.

255
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,455
[Christian Tissier] That's right.

256
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,374
That’s so true.

257
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,794
As an instructor, whether you can express what you want,

258
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:30,803
whether it be your experiences, age, physical strength, and also how you interpret Aikido,

259
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:39,687
that depends on a good ukemi.

260
00:24:41,188 --> 00:25:00,916
We really get the help of ukemi to express what we want to express.

261
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:08,590
We see from your answers that terminology is very important. Is it necessary to speak Japanese or to know Japan to become proficient in Aikido?

262
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,681
It doesn’t matter technique-wise,

263
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:25,274
but when there is a cultural element, it’s better if you can speak the language.

264
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:30,696
And from what I heard from my seniors who’d always been at Hombu,

265
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:40,164
the instructors didn’t explain the techniques at all.

266
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:49,548
You learned by watching, by taking an ukemi.

267
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:59,558
Your ability to watch, and to copy without words is important regardless of your role.

268
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,980
So the language itself is not that important,

269
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:14,073
but learning a language is essential in learning about that country’s culture.

270
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:21,497
You may be able to learn the techniques, but may not go beyond that.

271
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:30,839
It's always interesting to bring another culture to one's own culture.

272
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,386
I think that people who do Aikido and aren't Japanese are interested in Japanese culture.

273
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,223
They read books and show an interest.

274
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:47,397
I'm sometimes surprised by how much knowledge people have even though they don't speak Japanese.

275
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:55,697
When I look here, most people make efforts to speak a bit of Japanese.

276
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,158
Hello, goodbye, and so on.

277
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:04,373
It's complicated when you teach because there are many elements.

278
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:12,631
Tamura Sensei used to say "you must steal my techniques".

279
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,093
He meant that you must pay attention.

280
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,429
It's important and one can teach without talking,

281
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:26,770
but it's important to realize that when you are dealing with people from Japan, Italy, or Sweden,

282
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,814
it's not the same thing.

283
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:34,862
In Sweden, they don't react the same way as in North Africa in Algeria.

284
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,200
They have their own culture too so as a teacher you can say:

285
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:45,080
"I'm the boss, you must adapt to my culture",

286
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:52,588
or you can adapt to what every of them needs.

287
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:59,636
I don't have the same vocabulary in Serbia for example.

288
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,307
In Serbia, Aikido is quite new, people are strong,

289
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:11,940
so I don't use the same vocabulary than in Stockholm where the Aikido is softer and more fluid.

290
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,113
Words aren't the same and sometimes, a word can unblock a situation.

291
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:24,119
To get back to culture, people are very interested in culture,

292
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,041
because Aikido is aimed at people who are already well educated.

293
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:42,596
But also knowing the language doesn’t mean you know Aikido, so the language is not everything.

294
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:47,184
I also think it helps to some extent like Christian said.

295
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:53,273
For example, we didn’t use any translations for this seminar.

296
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,776
And we didn’t for a reason.

297
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,111
We were initially going to.

298
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:07,454
But there was a sound issue, and also inserting translations really affects the rhythm.

299
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,791
The way the Sensei feel would be different, and the results would be different.

300
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:23,095
So we decided not to do that half way through.

301
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:30,310
And if you really wanted to listen to Miyamoto Sensei and Christian, you really had to go in front of them.

302
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:36,984
Or if you missed a really good point, you could ask them later what they’d said.

303
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,360
We can work around that.

304
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:46,368
And like Miyamoto Sensei said, the Sensei at Hombu Dojo back then never explained anything.

305
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:53,041
They say: "stop, this is not good", but never explain why.

306
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,043
All they say is no good. [laughs]

307
00:29:55,252 --> 00:30:05,053
So the question was: "Do you have to learn the language?"

308
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,013
[Jordy Delage] And the culture too.

309
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:12,144
Well knowing it somewhat helps.

310
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:23,822
The example I like to use is how Yamaguchi Sensei would always say "Get on".

311
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:33,165
And that "Get on" (乗る, noru) can be really difficult to translate in French or English.

312
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:47,679
If you know that noru in Japanese means to ride the wave, let it do what it wants,

313
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:56,229
it might make more sense to you.

314
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:06,656
But then again, being able to picture it helps, but that doesn’t mean you can actually do it.

315
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:17,918
So that’s my take on language.

316
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,169
Thank you very much.

317
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:19,795
You're welcome, thank you very much.

318
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,837
Thank you very much.

319
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,546
Thank you.

320
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,423
Thank you very much.
