tilt so I'm here and we're going to do

12
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:49,829
tilt so I'm here and we're going to do
 

13
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,430
tilt so I'm here and we're going to do
the outward backward Kazushi pattern

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,440
the outward backward Kazushi pattern
 

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,930
the outward backward Kazushi pattern
with the Adibi hand here so you're not

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,940
with the Adibi hand here so you're not
 

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,860
with the Adibi hand here so you're not
going to use the format so I'm going to

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:02,870
going to use the format so I'm going to
 

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,530
going to use the format so I'm going to
round him and do it

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:08,540
round him and do it
 

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,060

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
technique you're gonna use your down if
 

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,179
technique you're gonna use your down if
you want but you'll be more skilled if

26
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:17,189
you want but you'll be more skilled if
 

27
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:29,679
you want but you'll be more skilled if
you can hit it with one hand

00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:29,689

 

29
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,899

you see his body is going to tilt and

30
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:35,909
you see his body is going to tilt and
 

31
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,010
you see his body is going to tilt and
then I'm gonna read either leg clover

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,020
then I'm gonna read either leg clover
 

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,260
then I'm gonna read either leg clover
hold on immediately okay I'm bring the

00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:45,689
other leg forward and then it's going to
 

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,760
other leg forward and then it's going to
come out this way so forget the

back then this is all no okay so he's
 

59
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,350
back then this is all no okay so he's
gonna laundry that foot forward but I

60
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
gonna laundry that foot forward but I
 

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,089
gonna laundry that foot forward but I
brought it back see that and then he's

62
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:41,099
brought it back see that and then he's
 

63
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,339
brought it back see that and then he's
gonna want to put that foot down but

64
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:43,349
gonna want to put that foot down but
 

65
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,280
gonna want to put that foot down but
we're not going that way so his foot

66
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,290
we're not going that way so his foot
 

67
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,140
we're not going that way so his foot
goes forward and then he wants to put

the foot down but that's not where its
 

71
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,280
the foot down but that's not where its
head it's gonna be so the Kazushi angles

72
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,290
head it's gonna be so the Kazushi angles
 

73
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,250
head it's gonna be so the Kazushi angles
over here you see it goes that way he's

74
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,260
over here you see it goes that way he's
 

75
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,099
over here you see it goes that way he's
not gonna be able to do that so I don't

76

error I'm not grabbing him it's just

84
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,180
error I'm not grabbing him it's just
 

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,369
error I'm not grabbing him it's just
that I can't even

86
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:22,379
that I can't even
 

87
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,509

boom okay let's go

88
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:26,519
boom okay let's go
 

89
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,809
boom okay let's go
okay so so why my exercise is easier I'm

90
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:32,819
okay so so why my exercise is easier I'm
 

91
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,259
okay so so why my exercise is easier I'm
just changing my foot angle okay so

92
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:36,269
just changing my foot angle okay so
 

93
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,619
just changing my foot angle okay so
we're just here and now I'm giving it

94
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:39,629
we're just here and now I'm giving it
 

95
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:52,870
we're just here and now I'm giving it
some purpose

96
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:52,880

 

97
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,630

but in inside the spiral I can keep that

98
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
but in inside the spiral I can keep that
 

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:10,160
but in inside the spiral I can keep that
that tension I'm doing this with my feet

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,170
that tension I'm doing this with my feet
 

101
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:17,210
that tension I'm doing this with my feet
so if not this this not ending I'm doing

102
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,220
so if not this this not ending I'm doing
 

103
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:51,560
so if not this this not ending I'm doing
another cultivation take that step okay

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,570
another cultivation take that step okay
 

105
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:59,480
another cultivation take that step okay
try it again you want to but when you

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,490
try it again you want to but when you
 

107
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,130
try it again you want to but when you
take the step you generate my Kazushi

108
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,140
take the step you generate my Kazushi
 

109
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,040
take the step you generate my Kazushi
pattern you see it's when you take that

110
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,050
pattern you see it's when you take that
 

111
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,350
pattern you see it's when you take that
step then because you see this shiitakes

112
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
step then because you see this shiitakes
 

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,050
step then because you see this shiitakes
black hair do you see and then you want

114
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,060
black hair do you see and then you want
 

115
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,660
black hair do you see and then you want
to put it back and then it's over here

116
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,670
to put it back and then it's over here
 

117
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,900
to put it back and then it's over here
so your resistance is helping my

118
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,910
so your resistance is helping my
 

119
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,980
so your resistance is helping my
technique

120
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:22,990

athletic he knows he's supposed to go
 

169
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
athletic he knows he's supposed to go
over there and then yeah that was a lot

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:12,810
over there and then yeah that was a lot
 

171
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,770
over there and then yeah that was a lot
of my energy and I don't want him to

172
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:15,780
of my energy and I don't want him to
 

173
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,190
of my energy and I don't want him to
have that okay so we're not like when I

174
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,200
have that okay so we're not like when I
 

175
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,920
have that okay so we're not like when I
do the move but we're over here is I

176
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:21,930
do the move but we're over here is I
 

177
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:33,620
do the move but we're over here is I
don't want to be able to die okay on my

right away that becomes my pivot point I

182
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:40,770
right away that becomes my pivot point I
 

183
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,400
right away that becomes my pivot point I
don't let him do that okay so you're

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,410
don't let him do that okay so you're
 

185
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:52,360
don't let him do that okay so you're
gonna feel compression and then I do

186
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,370

 

187
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,120

yeah so he's not he's not gonna walk

188
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,130
yeah so he's not he's not gonna walk
 

189
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:03,230
yeah so he's not he's not gonna walk
around me and then I do the first just

190
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
around me and then I do the first just
 

191
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,650
around me and then I do the first just
like here this part of the drill was

192
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:06,660
like here this part of the drill was
 

193
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,290
like here this part of the drill was
that foot gets pinned you see and that's

194
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,300
that foot gets pinned you see and that's
 

195
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,810
that foot gets pinned you see and that's
what allows him to do it on so the same

196
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:11,820
what allows him to do it on so the same
 

197
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,570
what allows him to do it on so the same
thing here there's an absorption and the

198
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
thing here there's an absorption and the
 

199
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,900
thing here there's an absorption and the
whole foot gets pinned and then boom up

200
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:19,910
whole foot gets pinned and then boom up
 

201
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,170
whole foot gets pinned and then boom up
but so if he tries to dive under it it

202
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,180
but so if he tries to dive under it it
 

203
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,630
but so if he tries to dive under it it
just works better because he picked

204
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:26,640
just works better because he picked
 

205
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,080
just works better because he picked
himself for you see that so but if I

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,090
himself for you see that so but if I
 

207
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,240
himself for you see that so but if I
don't have a pit and he dives under it

208
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,250
don't have a pit and he dives under it
 

209
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,339
don't have a pit and he dives under it
he's gone you see okay so you have now a

210
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:37,349
he's gone you see okay so you have now a
 

211
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,870
he's gone you see okay so you have now a
pressure on I thought you have to

212
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
pressure on I thought you have to
 

213
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
pressure on I thought you have to
understand what you're doing you have a

214
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:40,650
understand what you're doing you have a
 

215
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,950
understand what you're doing you have a
gravitational

216
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:41,960

all that leg and did you can use it as a

218
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
all that leg and did you can use it as a
 

219
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,190
all that leg and did you can use it as a
pivot point where his body can pivot

220
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
pivot point where his body can pivot
 

221

okay let's go on pin turn and just hand

222
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:56,420
okay let's go on pin turn and just hand
 

223
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,199
okay let's go on pin turn and just hand
comes in here is falling anyways right

224
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:01,209
comes in here is falling anyways right
 

225
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,139
comes in here is falling anyways right
so inside this curve there's a line

226
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:05,149
so inside this curve there's a line
 

227
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,440
so inside this curve there's a line
there has to be a eun-jung rule is it is

228
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,450
there has to be a eun-jung rule is it is
 

229
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,100
there has to be a eun-jung rule is it is
a free space where I do the technique

230
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,110

 

231
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,180

those of you that duck it out the bottom

232
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,190
those of you that duck it out the bottom
 

233
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,199
those of you that duck it out the bottom
you nothing like that hey so I the

234
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:20,209
you nothing like that hey so I the
 

235
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,120
you nothing like that hey so I the
throat was already happening on one huh

236
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,130
throat was already happening on one huh
 

237
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,810
throat was already happening on one huh
right so this just fits in there and

238
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:25,820
right so this just fits in there and
 

239
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,300
right so this just fits in there and
continues the kuzushi here is already

240
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,310
continues the kuzushi here is already
 

241
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,070
continues the kuzushi here is already
falling this is at a Meehan not at

242
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,080
falling this is at a Meehan not at
 

243
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,550
falling this is at a Meehan not at
throwing back I'm not going here here

244
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
throwing back I'm not going here here
 

245
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,010
throwing back I'm not going here here
and it was already quality is a 18 okay

246
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,020
and it was already quality is a 18 okay
 

247
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:50,260
and it was already quality is a 18 okay
so it's very effortless but you can see

248
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,270
so it's very effortless but you can see
 

249
00:09:50,270 --> 00:10:00,190
so it's very effortless but you can see
that was the same and now I'm doing the

250
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,200
that was the same and now I'm doing the
 

251
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,910
that was the same and now I'm doing the
front inward put on the backside meaning

252
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
front inward put on the backside meaning
 

253
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,250
front inward put on the backside meaning
there's only two it's actually one okay

254
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,260
there's only two it's actually one okay
 

255
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:18,270
there's only two it's actually one okay
so pivot thread here you go

256
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,280

 

257
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,800

okay let's go throw happen with the hand

258
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:24,810
okay let's go throw happen with the hand
 

259
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,620
okay let's go throw happen with the hand
okay so Y at Y in turn

260
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,630
okay so Y at Y in turn
 

261
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,120
okay so Y at Y in turn
well I'm not going here and then

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
shutting his body in that sometime and
 

265
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,360
shutting his body in that sometime and
when I bring the front inward position

266
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,370
when I bring the front inward position
 

267
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,730
when I bring the front inward position
what I'm going to do is take this full

what I'm going to do is take this full
 

269
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,960
what I'm going to do is take this full
body and pick it up that's my dog my job

270
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:54,970
body and pick it up that's my dog my job

on now okay so what your IQ toe is doing

294
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,570
on now okay so what your IQ toe is doing
 

295
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,010
on now okay so what your IQ toe is doing
is he starts out with line of gravity

296
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,020
is he starts out with line of gravity
 

297
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,980
is he starts out with line of gravity
and then but this whole once I do this

298
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:40,990
and then but this whole once I do this
 

299
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,980
and then but this whole once I do this
and I do the triangle OBD be knocking a

my job is not to throw him why my job is

312
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
my job is not to throw him why my job is
 

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,170

et me is to displace him with muck with

314
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,180
et me is to displace him with muck with
 

315
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:25,490
et me is to displace him with muck with
me okay so same technique will displace

317
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,650

what's what's different different is

318
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:28,660
what's what's different different is
 

319
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:44,850
what's what's different different is
here so you said you do Nittany kill -
