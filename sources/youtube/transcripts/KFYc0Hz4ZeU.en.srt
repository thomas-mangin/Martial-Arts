on
on the weapon you go like this you're

90
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
on the weapon you go like this you're
 

91
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,990
on the weapon you go like this you're
down here

92
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
down here
 

93
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,270
down here
you have a lot of space here remember

94
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
you have a lot of space here remember
 

95
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,150
you have a lot of space here remember
this technique

96
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
this technique
 

97
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,630
this technique
weight is supposed to be on the tip so i

98
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
weight is supposed to be on the tip so i
 

99

have a tsuba on this sword
 

101
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,670
have a tsuba on this sword
so you can see that

102
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
so you can see that
 

103
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,710
so you can see that
as i go back my hands are there

104
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
as i go back my hands are there
 

105

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
i come in boom and my hands stay there
 

107
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,710
i come in boom and my hands stay there
they're in the same position it doesn't

108

109
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,790
they're in the same position it doesn't
keep sliding

110
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800

grip here
okay the reason that's happening is

116
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
okay the reason that's happening is
 

117
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,470
okay the reason that's happening is
there's a kind of

118
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
there's a kind of
 

119
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,830
there's a kind of
naggy relationship with the sword and

120
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
naggy relationship with the sword and
 

121
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,910
naggy relationship with the sword and
you're fighting the sword so it's

122
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
you're fighting the sword so it's
 

123
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,869
you're fighting the sword so it's
pulling on

124
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
pulling on
 

125
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,030
pulling on
what you're pulling and you're losing

126
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040

the battle
 

129
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,949
the battle
and that's how your hands slide

130
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
and that's how your hands slide
 

131
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,110
and that's how your hands slide
there is a timing that you have to have

132
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
there is a timing that you have to have
 

133
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,309
there is a timing that you have to have
between your hands

134
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319

i'm going to feel that initial contact

238
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
i'm going to feel that initial contact
 

239
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,390
i'm going to feel that initial contact
and that's what starts to drop my center

240
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400

 

241
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,830

so if i feel the contact

242
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
so if i feel the contact

shoulders
 

247
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,629
shoulders
and that will provide the resistance

248
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
and that will provide the resistance
 

249
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,990
and that will provide the resistance
that he needs to cut

250
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000

259
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,830

if you want to let go of the hand it's

260
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
if you want to let go of the hand it's

absorb

264
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

265
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:47,030

266
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040

 

267
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:59,750

you keep moving this way

268
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760

 

269
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:09,350

now as i come in

270
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
now as i come in
 

271
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,990

that he never touches the right hand

272
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
that he never touches the right hand
 

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,190
that he never touches the right hand
okay

okay
 

275
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:51,269
okay
so we'll do the technique

276
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279

 

277
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,269

okay now on to the complete form

278
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
okay now on to the complete form
 

279
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,190
okay now on to the complete form
so we're going to walk into sega

280
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
so we're going to walk into sega
 

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,949
so we're going to walk into sega
and that adds your your measuring okay

282
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
and that adds your your measuring okay
 

283
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,949
and that adds your your measuring okay
uh you're gonna hold the sword at this

284
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
uh you're gonna hold the sword at this
 

285
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,949
uh you're gonna hold the sword at this
kind of neutral position

286
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
kind of neutral position
 

287
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,230
kind of neutral position
so this would be threatening but this

288
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
so this would be threatening but this
 

289
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,230
so this would be threatening but this
is uh not threatening so here at that 45

290
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
is uh not threatening so here at that 45
 

291
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,750
is uh not threatening so here at that 45
degree angle

292
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
degree angle
 

293
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,110
degree angle
and you walk and you time it and you hit

294
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
and you walk and you time it and you hit
 

295
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,550
and you walk and you time it and you hit
sega then the guy goes forward

296
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
sega then the guy goes forward
 

297
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,230
sega then the guy goes forward
he goes and you do the same exact move

298
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
he goes and you do the same exact move
 

299
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,310
he goes and you do the same exact move
now i initiated so i continue initiating

300
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
now i initiated so i continue initiating
 

301
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:50,389
now i initiated so i continue initiating
i'll come back

302
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399

 

303
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,279

and you repeat repeat repeat okay
