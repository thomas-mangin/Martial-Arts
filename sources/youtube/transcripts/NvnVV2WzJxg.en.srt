to do now
 

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,949
to do now
is I if that's what I'm going to push

32
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:33,959
is I if that's what I'm going to push
 

33

00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,949
my body work you see how so get ready
feel that pressure increase okay so

38
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:43,959
feel that pressure increase okay so
 

39
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,910
feel that pressure increase okay so
watch what I do

40
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
watch what I do
 

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,910
watch what I do
now pressures increase too you see so I

42
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
now pressures increase too you see so I
 

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,509
now pressures increase too you see so I
use my body work my footwork my other

44
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:54,519
use my body work my footwork my other

use my body work my footwork my other
hand work to low that pressure you see

46
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
hand work to low that pressure you see
 

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,470
hand work to low that pressure you see
so I don't have to go here so I load the

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
so I don't have to go here so I load the
 

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,350
so I don't have to go here so I load the

50
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
pressure boom she hits the pressure do
 

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,229
pressure boom she hits the pressure do
you see that you see that so that's what

52
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
you see that you see that so that's what

we're trying to do so that's what I'm
 

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,670
we're trying to do so that's what I'm
doing here when I go here there's really

56
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680
doing here when I go here there's really
 

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,430
doing here when I go here there's really
nothing on there at first cuz there

nothing on there at first cuz there
 

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,750
nothing on there at first cuz there
shouldn't be right so but I load it

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
shouldn't be right so but I load it
 

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,270
shouldn't be right so but I load it
there she hit it

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
there she hit it
 

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,550
there she hit it
boom but how I'm moving the rest of me

64
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
boom but how I'm moving the rest of me
 

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:56,350
boom but how I'm moving the rest of me
okay that's what we're trying to do

66
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:56,360

 

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,030

77
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:44,090

out you heard it again okay

78
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,100

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,110

all right so this this is in the

82
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,120
all right so this this is in the
 

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,670
all right so this this is in the
techniques so what I what I did was I'm

84
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
techniques so what I what I did was I'm
 

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,350
techniques so what I what I did was I'm
not going to clash here I'm going to

86
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:10,360
not going to clash here I'm going to
 

87
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,029
not going to clash here I'm going to
take her at an angle and you feel the

88
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:12,039
take her at an angle and you feel the
 

89
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,550
take her at an angle and you feel the
pressure is starting to increase on that

90
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,560
pressure is starting to increase on that
 

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,870
pressure is starting to increase on that
hand you see I take her at an angle and

92
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
hand you see I take her at an angle and
 

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,830
hand you see I take her at an angle and
then that hand can now just got got her

94
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
then that hand can now just got got her
 

95
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,909
then that hand can now just got got her
okay so if you look at it same thing

96
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
okay so if you look at it same thing
 

97
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,670
okay so if you look at it same thing
here you

98
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
here you
 

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,909
here you
see meaning we go boom she she H that

100
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
see meaning we go boom she she H that
 

101
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,629
see meaning we go boom she she H that
hand see that on the other one we here

102
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:35,639
hand see that on the other one we here
 

103
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,510
hand see that on the other one we here
boom she Hit That Elbow can get it she's

104
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
boom she Hit That Elbow can get it she's
 

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,749
boom she Hit That Elbow can get it she's
here Bo a bottom elbow down just none of

that matters but pay attention to what's

that matters but pay attention to what's
 

109
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,830
that matters but pay attention to what's
happening as the white spiral rotates

110
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
happening as the white spiral rotates
 

111
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,950
happening as the white spiral rotates
the x pattern right that we've

112
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:49,960
the x pattern right that we've
 

113
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,070
the x pattern right that we've
identified it will cute the young hand

114
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
identified it will cute the young hand
 

115
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,629
identified it will cute the young hand
that's what happens

116
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
that's what happens
 

117
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,070
that's what happens
okay you're not trying to tr her you're

118
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
okay you're not trying to tr her you're
 

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,510
okay you're not trying to tr her you're
just working with these pressures with

120
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
just working with these pressures with
 

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,350
just working with these pressures with
that pattern finding the pattern again

122
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
that pattern finding the pattern again
 

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,189
that pattern finding the pattern again
you get it

124
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
you get it
 

125
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,390
you get it
so careful when you you're not doing the

126
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
so careful when you you're not doing the
 

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,790
so careful when you you're not doing the
patter you're doing modern stuff because

128
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:15,800
patter you're doing modern stuff because
 

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,670
patter you're doing modern stuff because
it gets soft again you feel it's getting

130
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680
it gets soft again you feel it's getting
 

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,150
it gets soft again you feel it's getting
soft

132
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
soft
 

133
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,909
soft
again so you can't just go

134
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:22,919
again so you can't just go
 

135
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,029
again so you can't just go
wherever it's never got hard again until

136
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:26,039
wherever it's never got hard again until
 

137
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,309
wherever it's never got hard again until
here's the x pattern again you see there

138
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
here's the x pattern again you see there
 

139
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,550
here's the x pattern again you see there
it is right there

140
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
it is right there
 

141
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,390
it is right there
so careful you're not just doing

142
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,400
so careful you're not just doing
 

143
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,029
so careful you're not just doing
something you're feeling

144
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
something you're feeling
 

145
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,110
something you're feeling
instead feeling

146
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,120
instead feeling
 

147
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,830
instead feeling
instead so where that those pressures

148
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
instead so where that those pressures
 

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,710
instead so where that those pressures
are it's got sof in you see CU I over

150
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,720
are it's got sof in you see CU I over
 

151
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,350
are it's got sof in you see CU I over
rotated

152
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
rotated
 

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,230
rotated
okay try it again the x pattern is

154
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
okay try it again the x pattern is
 

155
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,790
okay try it again the x pattern is
setting up the the Y hand that's where

156
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
setting up the the Y hand that's where
 

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,830
setting up the the Y hand that's where
the C

158
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:56,840

 

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,589

projection see over rotated so he got

160
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:00,599
projection see over rotated so he got
 

161
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,990
projection see over rotated so he got
soft that became in space and he fell

162
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
soft that became in space and he fell
 

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,990
soft that became in space and he fell
into the in space then he got heavy

164
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000

 

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:23,589

okay you're over rotating every

166
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599

 

167
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:42,350

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:47,800

 

171
00:07:47,800 --> 00:08:01,790

is a little over roating

172
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:01,800

 

173
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,869

so you see the the the less you bring

174
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
so you see the the the less you bring
 

175
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,230
so you see the the the less you bring
him onto that let's just call the X

176
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,240
him onto that let's just call the X
 

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,070
him onto that let's just call the X
patter the L you bring him onto the x

178
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
patter the L you bring him onto the x
 

179
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,469
patter the L you bring him onto the x
pattern now you got to you got to make

180
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
pattern now you got to you got to make
 

181
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,070
pattern now you got to you got to make
up for it with your lips do you see that

182
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,080
up for it with your lips do you see that
 

183
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,990
up for it with your lips do you see that
okay so let's try to figure out how to

184
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
okay so let's try to figure out how to
 

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,990
okay so let's try to figure out how to
do the taaki the

186
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,000
do the taaki the
 

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,110
do the taaki the
asiak so that I don't have to use make

188
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,120
asiak so that I don't have to use make
 

189
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,629
asiak so that I don't have to use make
up for all

190
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
up for all
 

191
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,070
up for all
my unacquired energetic value

192
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
my unacquired energetic value
 

193
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,190
my unacquired energetic value
you see with the movement of my hands to

194
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,200
you see with the movement of my hands to
 

195
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:45,190
you see with the movement of my hands to
space okay that's what we're doing try

196
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200

 

197
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,670

again over

198
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680

 

199
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,430

rotate so a lot of times why we have to

200
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,440
rotate so a lot of times why we have to
 

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,430
rotate so a lot of times why we have to
over

202
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
over
 

203
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,030
over
rotate is because I can't internalize

204
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,040
rotate is because I can't internalize
 

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,509
rotate is because I can't internalize
I'm going to lose

206
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
I'm going to lose
 

207
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,150
I'm going to lose
positional okay like this is oh that big

208
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,160
positional okay like this is oh that big
 

209
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,430
positional okay like this is oh that big
guy do you get it so we're like oh

210
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:04,440
guy do you get it so we're like oh
 

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,190
guy do you get it so we're like oh
better take him off of me you see that

212
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
better take him off of me you see that
 

213
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,190
better take him off of me you see that
but you can internalize and you just

214
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
but you can internalize and you just
 

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,829
but you can internalize and you just
you'll hit that you'll hit that do you

216
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
you'll hit that you'll hit that do you
 

217
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,230
you'll hit that you'll hit that do you
get that so by absorbing the energy

218
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240
get that so by absorbing the energy
 

219
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,430
get that so by absorbing the energy
inside you letting it pass through you

220
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,440
inside you letting it pass through you
 

221
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,110
inside you letting it pass through you
you are you don't have to do a big

222
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,120
you are you don't have to do a big
 

223
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,110
you are you don't have to do a big
movement to get we're

224
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
movement to get we're
 

225
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,389
movement to get we're
choosing to move to the x pattern which

226
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
choosing to move to the x pattern which
 

227
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,870
choosing to move to the x pattern which
has some rot

228
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
has some rot
 

229
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,069
has some rot
but I'm not having to rotate so that he

230
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:34,079
but I'm not having to rotate so that he
 

231
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,150
but I'm not having to rotate so that he
can't B me over do you see that subtle

232
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,160
can't B me over do you see that subtle
 

233
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,150
can't B me over do you see that subtle
difference okay so you end up feeling

234
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,160
difference okay so you end up feeling
 

235
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,590
difference okay so you end up feeling
his weight you over rotating soft

236
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:44,600
his weight you over rotating soft
 

237
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,310
his weight you over rotating soft
again you you you have to

238
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,320
again you you you have to
 

239
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,550
again you you you have to
absorb to to be able to feel that so you

240
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
absorb to to be able to feel that so you
 

241
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,790
absorb to to be able to feel that so you
got to ground on the foot the projection

242
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
got to ground on the foot the projection
 

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,389
got to ground on the foot the projection
Foot Right let it come in and let let

244
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:55,399
Foot Right let it come in and let let
 

245
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,990
Foot Right let it come in and let let
that hit you until it rebounds off for

246
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
that hit you until it rebounds off for
 

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,870
that hit you until it rebounds off for
you okay pay attention it's it's not

248
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
you okay pay attention it's it's not
 

249
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,910
you okay pay attention it's it's not
going to be just body work we're

250
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:02,920
going to be just body work we're
 

251
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,670
going to be just body work we're
assuming you can internalize the young

252
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:06,680
assuming you can internalize the young
 

253
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,790
assuming you can internalize the young
aspect right you get that that's we've

254
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:09,800
aspect right you get that that's we've
 

255
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:18,310
aspect right you get that that's we've
already done that okay try it

256
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320

 

257
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,389

again if we're getting pushed

258
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399

 

259
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,949

off so look your arches are

260
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:29,959
off so look your arches are
 

261
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,389
off so look your arches are
your toes are poting away from each

262
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
your toes are poting away from each
 

263
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,350
your toes are poting away from each
other right going to shift my weights my

264
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
other right going to shift my weights my
 

265
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,990
other right going to shift my weights my
heels along the midot it's going to be

266
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,000
heels along the midot it's going to be
 

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,430
heels along the midot it's going to be
much harder okay that's what I mean

268
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,440
much harder okay that's what I mean
 

269
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,590
much harder okay that's what I mean
we've already done the internalizing

270
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:44,600
we've already done the internalizing
 

271
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,190
we've already done the internalizing
young aspect work so you bring it into

272
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:48,200
young aspect work so you bring it into
 

273
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,030
young aspect work so you bring it into
this real okay not replace it with this

274
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
this real okay not replace it with this
 

275
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:28,110
this real okay not replace it with this
deviation of our body okay try it again

276
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,120

 

277
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,030

so there's a tail sign of

278
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,040

 

279
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,829

the fun okay so when I I come in and the

280
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
the fun okay so when I I come in and the
 

281
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,509
the fun okay so when I I come in and the
attachment is a tail tail sign of it

282
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:44,519
attachment is a tail tail sign of it
 

283
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,190
attachment is a tail tail sign of it
such that when you have two we can all

284
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
such that when you have two we can all
 

285
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,509
such that when you have two we can all
tell you're get

286
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:52,519
tell you're get
 

287
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,069
tell you're get
surprised when you're in the alchemical

288
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:57,079
surprised when you're in the alchemical
 

289
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,230
surprised when you're in the alchemical
state awareness increases

290
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
state awareness increases
 

291
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:13,110
state awareness increases
not decrease it you don't have this

292
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120

 

293
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,790

surprise okay you see I'm not really

294
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:15,800
surprise okay you see I'm not really
 

295
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,990
surprise okay you see I'm not really
even looking at them okay so try to keep

296
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,000
even looking at them okay so try to keep
 

297
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,030
even looking at them okay so try to keep
that because a lot of people

298
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
that because a lot of people
 

299
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,990
that because a lot of people
think you're looking for a

300
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
think you're looking for a
 

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,550
think you're looking for a
hyperfocus and you're not that you're

302
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,560
hyperfocus and you're not that you're
 

303
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,430
hyperfocus and you're not that you're
not trying to concentrate on something

304
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,440
not trying to concentrate on something
 

305
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,230
not trying to concentrate on something
there's just an expansion of awareness

306
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
there's just an expansion of awareness
 

307
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,470
there's just an expansion of awareness
okay which which is why you need the

308
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,480
okay which which is why you need the
 

309
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,870
okay which which is why you need the
other line because that doesn't function

310
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:37,880
other line because that doesn't function
 

311
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,350
other line because that doesn't function
all the time right like I told you

312
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
all the time right like I told you
 

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,350
all the time right like I told you
driving through traffic don't drive like

314
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,360
driving through traffic don't drive like
 

315
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,430
driving through traffic don't drive like
that you got to pay attention because

316
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,440
that you got to pay attention because
 

317
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,829
that you got to pay attention because
there's so many things I got to obey the

318
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:46,839
there's so many things I got to obey the
 

319
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,350
there's so many things I got to obey the
law how's my car freaking work what's

320
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
law how's my car freaking work what's
 

321
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,350
law how's my car freaking work what's
that do that that kind it doesn't do any

322
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
that do that that kind it doesn't do any
 

323
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,110
that do that that kind it doesn't do any
good to go I'm about to be hit but I

324
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,120
good to go I'm about to be hit but I
 

325
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,230
good to go I'm about to be hit but I
forgot where my blinker is and you know

326
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
forgot where my blinker is and you know
 

327
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,110
forgot where my blinker is and you know
cuz I'm driving the White's car or what

328
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,120
cuz I'm driving the White's car or what
 

329
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,389
cuz I'm driving the White's car or what
have you make sense okay but we

330
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
have you make sense okay but we
 

331
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,710
have you make sense okay but we
shouldn't see a

332
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
shouldn't see a
 

333
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,750
shouldn't see a
surprise and we shouldn't see the

334
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
surprise and we shouldn't see the
 

335
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,670
surprise and we shouldn't see the
surprise breath where we're holding it

336
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:08,680
surprise breath where we're holding it
 

337
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,269
surprise breath where we're holding it
and then we start breathing again okay

338
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
and then we start breathing again okay
 

339
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,110
and then we start breathing again okay
let's try it again we're we're not doing

340
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
let's try it again we're we're not doing
 

341
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:28,110
let's try it again we're we're not doing
fut doie but we still shouldn't see that

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,120

 

343
00:13:28,120 --> 00:14:22,910

okay for

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:22,920

 

345
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,710

all right I in this kind of drone this

346
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:25,720
all right I in this kind of drone this
 

347
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,430
all right I in this kind of drone this
is like freom me like G okay they're

348
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
is like freom me like G okay they're
 

349
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,350
is like freom me like G okay they're
coming in with different angles from

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
coming in with different angles from
 

351
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,550
coming in with different angles from
different vectors all that kind of stuff

352
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:33,560
different vectors all that kind of stuff
 

353
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,990

so I don't want to really prescribe it

354
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
so I don't want to really prescribe it
 

355
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,790
so I don't want to really prescribe it
but if you pay attention okay here's the

356
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
but if you pay attention okay here's the
 

357
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,790
but if you pay attention okay here's the
180 you see make sense okay so I have to

358
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:45,800
180 you see make sense okay so I have to
 

359
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,189
180 you see make sense okay so I have to
get off the

360
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
get off the
 

361
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,590
get off the
180 so I will start to move my

362
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:50,600
180 so I will start to move my
 

363
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,629
180 so I will start to move my
body at some 90° fluctuation to it do

364
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
body at some 90° fluctuation to it do
 

365
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,710
body at some 90° fluctuation to it do
you see that but I don't want to do that

technique okay we're not fighting okay
 

497
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:08,750
technique okay we're not fighting okay
so try it

498
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760

 

499
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,270

again yeah there's a lot of leg tension

500
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
again yeah there's a lot of leg tension
 

501
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,830
again yeah there's a lot of leg tension
there do you see and the and the

502
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:12,840
there do you see and the and the
 

503
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,149
there do you see and the and the
projection decreased so probably more of

504
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:15,159
projection decreased so probably more of
 

505
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:18,630
projection decreased so probably more of
it was just moving my body mass okay and

506
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
it was just moving my body mass okay and
 

507
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,830
it was just moving my body mass okay and
you're bigger than all of

508
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:20,840
you're bigger than all of
 

509
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,789
you're bigger than all of
them keep

510
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
them keep
 

511
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:36,669
them keep
going tension out of your lower body

512
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:36,679

 

513
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:53,350

we're back to

514
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360

 

515
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:03,470

surprise good watch your feet angle

516
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:03,480

 

517
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:16,669

he

518
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:16,679

 

519
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,870

weighted

520
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880

 

521
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:37,750

stay tension in the lower legs

522
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760

 

523
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,070

so I can't it's so hard I you can't be

524
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
so I can't it's so hard I you can't be
 

525
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,909
so I can't it's so hard I you can't be
corrected in the middle of a g was it

526
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:44,919
corrected in the middle of a g was it
 

527
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,390
corrected in the middle of a g was it
you get it so you have to use all your

528
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
you get it so you have to use all your
 

529
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,110
you get it so you have to use all your
training there's a way of moving from

530
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
training there's a way of moving from
 

531
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,950
training there's a way of moving from
one point on the map to the other point

532
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
one point on the map to the other point
 

533
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,270
one point on the map to the other point
on the map I have to get the Y knee

534
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
on the map I have to get the Y knee
 

535
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,870
on the map I have to get the Y knee
right I single p Pivot Point all that

536
00:20:59,870 --> 00:20:59,880
right I single p Pivot Point all that
 

537
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,070
right I single p Pivot Point all that
kind of stuff I keep my Cent my line of

538
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
kind of stuff I keep my Cent my line of
 

539
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,190
kind of stuff I keep my Cent my line of
gravity out from between my feet do you

540
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
gravity out from between my feet do you
 

541
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,909
gravity out from between my feet do you
see that we're not really doing that

542
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:06,919
see that we're not really doing that
 

543
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,549
see that we're not really doing that
you're kind of just constantly double

544
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:09,559
you're kind of just constantly double
 

545
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,470
you're kind of just constantly double
waiting line of gravity in between your

waiting line of gravity in between your
 

547
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,190
waiting line of gravity in between your
feet and all it takes is for

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
feet and all it takes is for
 

549
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,430
feet and all it takes is for
some a little bit of Mind

550
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,440
some a little bit of Mind
 

551
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,789

go this is a lot of wrong foot angle and

562
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,120
go this is a lot of wrong foot angle and
 

563
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,190
go this is a lot of wrong foot angle and
a lot of line of gravity between the two

it it just goes up okay um but by

588
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:50,840
it it just goes up okay um but by
 

589
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,149
it it just goes up okay um but by
bringing it to the surface now we can

590
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:53,159
bringing it to the surface now we can
 

591
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,750
bringing it to the surface now we can
work on it before we were hiding on it

592
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:56,760
work on it before we were hiding on it
 

593
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,470
work on it before we were hiding on it
and let's do a side note here that's

594
00:23:59,470 --> 00:23:59,480
and let's do a side note here that's
 

595

training that is what it does okay to

606
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:15,559
training that is what it does okay to
 

607
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,590
training that is what it does okay to
not be surprised that it doesn't and in

608
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:18,600
not be surprised that it doesn't and in
 

609
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,390
not be surprised that it doesn't and in
its personation it will hide that it was

610
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
its personation it will hide that it was
 

611
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,070
its personation it will hide that it was
doing that do you see and the

612
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
doing that do you see and the
 

613
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,470
doing that do you see and the
teacher is going to one know that

614
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:29,480
teacher is going to one know that
 

615
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,070
teacher is going to one know that
process two that mind cannot hide from

616
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,080
process two that mind cannot hide from
 

617
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,310
process two that mind cannot hide from
the teacher so the teacher will find the

618
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,320
the teacher so the teacher will find the
 

619
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,350
the teacher so the teacher will find the
thing make you work on that thing that

620
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:40,360
thing make you work on that thing that
 

621
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,029
thing make you work on that thing that
will allow you to see that thing do do

622
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
will allow you to see that thing do do
 

623
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,149
will allow you to see that thing do do
you get that it's not a comfortable

624
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:47,159
you get that it's not a comfortable
 

625
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,470
you get that it's not a comfortable
process especially when it's something

626
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:49,480
process especially when it's something
 

627
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,110
process especially when it's something
that's really got your freaking mind

628
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
that's really got your freaking mind
 

629
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,470
that's really got your freaking mind
okay but that's the process and now you

630
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,480
okay but that's the process and now you
 

631
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,990
okay but that's the process and now you
can work on it do you see before

632
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
can work on it do you see before
 

633
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,630
can work on it do you see before
whatever success I thought I had was

634
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:01,640
whatever success I thought I had was
 

635
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,389
whatever success I thought I had was
that uration that was unexposed okay and

that uration that was unexposed okay and
 

637
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,549
that uration that was unexposed okay and
now you can work on it so we'll work on

638
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
now you can work on it so we'll work on
 

639
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,950
now you can work on it so we'll work on
it

noting
 

647
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,669
noting
was my ego tripartite mind is

648
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
was my ego tripartite mind is
 

649
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,990
was my ego tripartite mind is
functioning made evident in the surprise

650
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,000
functioning made evident in the surprise
 

651
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,510
functioning made evident in the surprise
and the breath holding all that kind of

652
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
and the breath holding all that kind of
 

653
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,230
and the breath holding all that kind of
stuff right the muscle uh tension

654
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,240
stuff right the muscle uh tension
 

655
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,549
stuff right the muscle uh tension
variation all that is that mind is

656
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:33,559
variation all that is that mind is
 

657
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,510
variation all that is that mind is
working okay and uh it's not going to

658
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
working okay and uh it's not going to
 

659
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,669
working okay and uh it's not going to
stop working if you have tension in the

660
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:40,679
stop working if you have tension in the
 

661
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,470
stop working if you have tension in the

is there okay you're going to have to
 

755
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,430
is there okay you're going to have to
learn how to use the x pattern past the

756
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
learn how to use the x pattern past the
 

757
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,630
learn how to use the x pattern past the
8:00 reversing it all that kind of stuff

okay find the center ignore the knife up
 

769
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,909
okay find the center ignore the knife up
did you see that

770
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919

 

771
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:37,669

so so the the first thing you have to

786
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:19,159
so so the the first thing you have to
 

787
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,269
so so the the first thing you have to
always do right so let's go back to this

788
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
always do right so let's go back to this
 

789
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,789
always do right so let's go back to this
and look at the Marshall concept she's

790
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:23,799
and look at the Marshall concept she's
 

791
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,950
and look at the Marshall concept she's
trying she was trying some grab

792
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
trying she was trying some grab
 

793
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,029
trying she was trying some grab
a she's trying some gravit right

794
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:30,039
a she's trying some gravit right
 

795
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,430
a she's trying some gravit right
whatever it is my whatever and I disarm

796
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
whatever it is my whatever and I disarm
 

797
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,310
whatever it is my whatever and I disarm
stick okay right you got to do that in

798
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,320
stick okay right you got to do that in
 

799
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,149
stick okay right you got to do that in
other words you have to have some angle

800
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:39,159
other words you have to have some angle
 

801
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,070
other words you have to have some angle
of deviation coupled with some angle of

of deviation coupled with some angle of
 

803
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,870
of deviation coupled with some angle of
deflection right and you have to have a

804
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:45,880
deflection right and you have to have a
 

805
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,669
deflection right and you have to have a
center you see you have to have a center

806
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:48,679

I'm not just going here like this do you
 

811
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,870
I'm not just going here like this do you
understand so I as I deflect I have her

812
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
understand so I as I deflect I have her
 

813
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,909

Center already see that and then I have

814
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
Center already see that and then I have
 

815
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,950
Center already see that and then I have
to spiral rotate the fight so that I get

816
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
to spiral rotate the fight so that I get
 

817
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,149
to spiral rotate the fight so that I get
into the x pattern and I can find the

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,069

on all right

1002
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
on all right

on all right
uh you can see how the added element is

1004
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:25,839
uh you can see how the added element is
 

1005
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,630
uh you can see how the added element is
making it more access the information

1006
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:29,640
making it more access the information
 

1007
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,750
making it more access the information
but that difficulty was in the other

drill too it's just so subtle you
probably aren't seeing it okay so this

1012
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:37,680
probably aren't seeing it okay so this
 

1013
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,190
probably aren't seeing it okay so this
again that this is the process the

which is solved by the same process of
 

1027
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,589
which is solved by the same process of
your internalizing your

to this same freaking technique do you

1232
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:23,599
to this same freaking technique do you
 

1233
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,230
to this same freaking technique do you
see that over and over and if you start

1234

see that over and over and if you start
 

1235
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,470
see that over and over and if you start
now analyzing

The Waiting was the same the adhesion
was the same the traversing of her

1244
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
was the same the traversing of her
 

1245
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,670
was the same the traversing of her
Center across the mat was the same The

1246

Gaze was the same the breath pattern was
 

1249
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,030
Gaze was the same the breath pattern was
the same do you do you see

1250
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
the same do you do you see
 

1251
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,430
the same do you do you see
that but yet there was a difference to

1252
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:56,440
that but yet there was a difference to
 

1253
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,630

we ran into problems okay

1260
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:05,480
we ran into problems okay
 

1261
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,549
we ran into problems okay
uh any comments or

1262
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,559

questions do you have anything to share
on that experience of the ukemi on that

1266
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,240
on that experience of the ukemi on that

last one you might not I don't know well

1268
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:19,720
last one you might not I don't know well
 

1269
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,710
last one you might not I don't know well
well yeah as usual you always had my

1270
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:22,720
well yeah as usual you always had my
 

1271
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,230
well yeah as usual you always had my
Center where there's times when going

1272
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:26,240
Center where there's times when going
 

1273
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,990
Center where there's times when going
with SH CH

1274
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,000
with SH CH
 

1275
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,030
with SH CH
where I have a solid stance or they have

1276
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
where I have a solid stance or they have
 

1277
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,670
where I have a solid stance or they have
a solid stance um and so it's harder to

1278
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:35,680
a solid stance um and so it's harder to
 

1279
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,990
a solid stance um and so it's harder to
find the rotation because you don't I

1280
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,000
find the rotation because you don't I
 

1281
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,030
find the rotation because you don't I
don't have the center yeah

1282
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,040
don't have the center yeah
 

1283
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,950
don't have the center yeah
um probably the

1284
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:44,960
um probably the
 

1285
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,190
um probably the
most okay yeah when we start just arm

1286
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:48,200
most okay yeah when we start just arm
 

1287
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,069
most okay yeah when we start just arm
fighting okay and so in in

1288
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:53,079
fighting okay and so in in
 

1289
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:58,270
fighting okay and so in in
my in my uh understanding

1290
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:58,280
my in my uh understanding
 

1291
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,470
my in my uh understanding
of all this stuff if I if I have your

1292
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:03,480
of all this stuff if I if I have your
 

1293
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,470
of all this stuff if I if I have your
Center you have to now

1294
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
Center you have to now
 

1295
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,309
Center you have to now
fight to regain your

1296
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
fight to regain your
 

1297
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,150
fight to regain your
initiative

1298
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
initiative
 

1299
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,549
initiative
and that is a lot harder to

1300
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:15,559
and that is a lot harder to
 

1301
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,790
and that is a lot harder to
do than you had initiative and you keep

1302
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:19,800
do than you had initiative and you keep
 

1303
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,589
do than you had initiative and you keep
initiative do you understand that so

1304
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:22,599
initiative do you understand that so
 

1305
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,910
initiative do you understand that so
whatever your counter might be let's say

1306
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:24,920
whatever your counter might be let's say
 

1307
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,589
whatever your counter might be let's say
you love the the double leg okay if you

1308
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:30,599
you love the the double leg okay if you
 

1309
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,589
you love the the double leg okay if you
can throw the double leg from initiative

1310
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
can throw the double leg from initiative
 

1311
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,109
can throw the double leg from initiative
you're going to be very very

1312
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:36,119
you're going to be very very
 

1313
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,270
you're going to be very very
successful you try to throw the double

1314
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:39,280
successful you try to throw the double
 

1315
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,109
successful you try to throw the double
leg from no initiative you're not

1316
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:42,119
leg from no initiative you're not
 

1317
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,390
leg from no initiative you're not
 getting it do you see or if you

1318
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:45,400
getting it do you see or if you
 

1319
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,109
getting it do you see or if you
try to have to regain initiative so you

1320
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
try to have to regain initiative so you
 

1321
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,030
try to have to regain initiative so you
can throw the double leg you probably

1322
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,040
can throw the double leg you probably
 

1323
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,829
can throw the double leg you probably
are not going to get it either I'm way

1324

then in comparison the double leg from
initiative so the same thing goes with

00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,990
Sean you're over rotating past that X
right but once you know how to do that

1480
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,000
right but once you know how to do that
 

1481
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,230
right but once you know how to do that
that to me the technique is is really

1482
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,240
that to me the technique is is really
 

1483
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,630
that to me the technique is is really
over the drill is over because the

1484
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:43,640
over the drill is over because the
 

1485
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,349
over the drill is over because the
spiritual aspects already happen if my

1486
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:46,359
spiritual aspects already happen if my
 

1487
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:47,950
spiritual aspects already happen if my
mind did not

1488
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:47,960
mind did not
 

1489
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,630
mind did not
drop in the beginning I wouldn't have

1490
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
drop in the beginning I wouldn't have

adhered and seized your Center at the at

1492
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:53,240
adhered and seized your Center at the at
 

1493
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,910
adhered and seized your Center at the at
the first Contact you see that and if I

1494
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:56,920
the first Contact you see that and if I
 

1495
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,510
the first Contact you see that and if I
can't take it on a curve I would have

1496
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:00,520
can't take it on a curve I would have
 

1497
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,789
can't take it on a curve I would have
been

1498
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:01,799
been
 

1499
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:05,190
been
contesting do you see that and so I

1500
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
contesting do you see that and so I
 

1501
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,230
contesting do you see that and so I
would have had to also know how to uh

1502
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:09,240
would have had to also know how to uh
 

1503
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,470
would have had to also know how to uh
drop the Yang aspect internalize the

1504
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:11,480
drop the Yang aspect internalize the
 

1505
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,390
drop the Yang aspect internalize the
Yang aspect so there's really nothing

1506
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
Yang aspect so there's really nothing
 

1507
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,510
Yang aspect so there's really nothing
left to do for the co that all all the

1508
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:18,520
left to do for the co that all all the
 

1509
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,630
left to do for the co that all all the
aspects of Coq already happen so that's

1510
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640
aspects of Coq already happen so that's
 

1511
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,589
aspects of Coq already happen so that's
why a lot of times I just leave the

1512
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:24,599
why a lot of times I just leave the
 

1513
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,710
why a lot of times I just leave the
curve and stop the projection okay

1514
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:27,720
curve and stop the projection okay
 

1515
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,230
curve and stop the projection okay
sometimes I just make sure I can feel it

1516
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
sometimes I just make sure I can feel it
 

1517
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,670

1519
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,910
but you don't have to you're you did the
drill you did what we want out of the

1520
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:34,920
drill you did what we want out of the
 

1521

that'll give me the technique but this
 

1567
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,589
that'll give me the technique but this
this can't so before keep in mind what

whether it's whether you your analogy is
magnet boots or suction cuffs or it

1638

okay um but it goes back there no

1642
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480
okay um but it goes back there no
 

1643
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,750
okay um but it goes back there no
flexion in the feet so the weight of the

make sense but when we push on the UK
 

1651
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,510
make sense but when we push on the UK

push on the mat the opposite starts to
happen we don't sink into the mat

1654
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:46,640
happen we don't sink into the mat
 

1655

comments yep I mean we we touched on

1714
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
comments yep I mean we we touched on
 

1715
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,230
comments yep I mean we we touched on
this already but um that analogy of the

1716
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,240
this already but um that analogy of the
 

1717
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,430
this already but um that analogy of the
fight the Archer not the arrow yes so

1718
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:18,440
fight the Archer not the arrow yes so
 

1719
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,829
fight the Archer not the arrow yes so
you were fighting the Archer we were our

you were fighting the Archer we were our
 

1721
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,029
you were fighting the Archer we were our
first concern is the knife and then we

1722
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:23,039
first concern is the knife and then we
 

1723
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,670
first concern is the knife and then we
get to go to the rest whereas no matter

1724
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:26,680
get to go to the rest whereas no matter
 

1725
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,910
get to go to the rest whereas no matter
what position I was in no matter where

1726
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:28,920
what position I was in no matter where
 

1727
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,870
what position I was in no matter where
my knife was you had everything else

1728
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
my knife was you had everything else
 

1729
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,230
my knife was you had everything else
yeah and just I didn't make that up

1730
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:35,240
yeah and just I didn't make that up
 

1731
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,829
yeah and just I didn't make that up
that's the old Roman legion Maxim fight

1732

that's the old Roman legion Maxim fight
 

1733
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:42,430
that's the old Roman legion Maxim fight
the Archer not the arrow so kind of take

1734
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:42,440
the Archer not the arrow so kind of take
 

1735
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,950
the Archer not the arrow so kind of take
that into context those people

1736
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:45,960
that into context those people
 

1737
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,789
that into context those people
conquered right they kicked the out

1738
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:48,799
conquered right they kicked the out
 

1739
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,750
conquered right they kicked the out
of people after people and ultimately

1740
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:52,760
of people after people and ultimately
 

1741
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,349
of people after people and ultimately
decided not to do it anymore is what

1742
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:55,359
decided not to do it anymore is what
 

1743
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,029
decided not to do it anymore is what
happened okay and then and then they

1744
00:58:58,029 --> 00:58:58,039
happened okay and then and then they
 

1745
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,230
happened okay and then and then they
lost their Edge there but there was a

1746
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:01,240
lost their Edge there but there was a
 

1747
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,670
lost their Edge there but there was a
time when any time they wanted

1748
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:03,680
time when any time they wanted
 

1749
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,270
time when any time they wanted
to they they would and could and so you

1750
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
to they they would and could and so you
 

1751
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,670
to they they would and could and so you
got to take that to heart it's not it's

1752
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:09,680
got to take that to heart it's not it's
 

1753
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,710
got to take that to heart it's not it's
not a

not a
marshall take it or leave it it's like

1756
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:13,559
marshall take it or leave it it's like
 

1757
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,990
marshall take it or leave it it's like
no no no no I have to figure out what

1758
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
no no no no I have to figure out what
 

1759
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,589
no no no no I have to figure out what
this means and that is how I understood

1760
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:18,599
this means and that is how I understood
 

1761
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,270
this means and that is how I understood
that Maxim in in this kind of oneon-one

1762
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:22,280
that Maxim in in this kind of oneon-one
 

1763
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,670
that Maxim in in this kind of oneon-one
sees the center everything else Falls

1764
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
sees the center everything else Falls
 

1765
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,950
sees the center everything else Falls
from there

1766
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
from there
 

1767
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,349
from there
