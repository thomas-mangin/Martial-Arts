1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,330

okay

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:02,340
okay
 

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,390
okay
Okay

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400

 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,309

the third spur is very hard to get hold

6
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:07,319
the third spur is very hard to get hold
 

7
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:08,210
the third spur is very hard to get hold
of

8
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,220
of
 

9
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,730
of
and you know to uh the third square is

10
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:10,740
and you know to uh the third square is
 

11
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,490
and you know to uh the third square is
very hard to do

12
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:13,500

 

13
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,250

I was saying you are only I think

14
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,260
I was saying you are only I think
 

15
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,349
I was saying you are only I think
yesterday

16
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
yesterday
 

17
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,410
yesterday
it should be

18
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,420
it should be
 

19
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,510
it should be
straight up

20
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,520
straight up
 

21
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,509
straight up
over the head because the intention is

22
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:26,519
over the head because the intention is
 

23
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,330
over the head because the intention is
to take in the Universal key this is

24
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,340
to take in the Universal key this is
 

25
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,890
to take in the Universal key this is
like a funnel

26
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:30,900
like a funnel
 

27
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,030
like a funnel
and the and the key is pouring down into

28
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
and the and the key is pouring down into
 

29
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,110
and the and the key is pouring down into
our head

30
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,120
our head
 

31
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,130
our head
this is you know the Japanese uh belief

32
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,140
this is you know the Japanese uh belief
 

33
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,209
this is you know the Japanese uh belief
but

34
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219
but
 

35
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,790
but
most people they try and get all these

36
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
most people they try and get all these
 

37
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,549
most people they try and get all these
points points correct and then they go

38
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
points points correct and then they go
 

39
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,110
points points correct and then they go
and drop it out to the side

40
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120

 

41
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,630

and so the enemy can see exactly where

42
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
and so the enemy can see exactly where
 

43
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,529
and so the enemy can see exactly where
their sword is or they get here

44
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:57,539
their sword is or they get here
 

45
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,330
their sword is or they get here
and then they turn their body like that

46
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,340
and then they turn their body like that
 

47
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,850
and then they turn their body like that
so it's like it's difficult I've got the

48
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:04,860
so it's like it's difficult I've got the
 

49
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,969
so it's like it's difficult I've got the
sword in the right place now the body's

50
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:07,979
sword in the right place now the body's
 

51
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,270
sword in the right place now the body's
showing all this

52
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280

 

53
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,810

the third one that I I see quite regular

54
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:14,820
the third one that I I see quite regular
 

55
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,270
the third one that I I see quite regular
is as they drop it

56
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
is as they drop it
 

57
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,510
is as they drop it
they sort of go forward like that

58
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,520
they sort of go forward like that
 

59
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,910
they sort of go forward like that
so to me they're becoming the aggressor

60
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:22,920
so to me they're becoming the aggressor
 

61
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,050
so to me they're becoming the aggressor
because they're becoming the enemy

62
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,060

 

63
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,310

so I just prefer to teach

64
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
so I just prefer to teach
 

65
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,109
so I just prefer to teach
show that

66
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
show that
 

67
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,429
show that
teach

68
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:34,439
teach
 

69
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,130
teach
the first movie

70
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,140
the first movie
 

71
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,069
the first movie
the second suburbs

72
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,079

 

73
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,950

the third surprise

74
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
the third surprise
 

75
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,730
the third surprise
or if I do the first

76
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:48,740
or if I do the first
 

77
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,249
or if I do the first
three or should I do the second

78
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:52,259
three or should I do the second
 

79
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,690
three or should I do the second
so I I hit the same

80
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:56,700

 

81
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,190

spot

82
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,200
spot
 

83
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,469
spot
first movie

84
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
first movie
 

85
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,690
first movie
seconds of early

86
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:02,700
seconds of early
 

87
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,330
seconds of early
I'll do the third story

88
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:05,340
I'll do the third story
 

89
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,510
I'll do the third story
so I'm not so interested in

90
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
so I'm not so interested in
 

91
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,630
so I'm not so interested in
because it's my body that I'm interested

92
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
because it's my body that I'm interested
 

93
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,570
because it's my body that I'm interested
in developing it's we do the weapons to

94
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:14,580
in developing it's we do the weapons to
 

95
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,110
in developing it's we do the weapons to
develop our taijitsu

96
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,120
develop our taijitsu
 

97
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,229
develop our taijitsu
and if we start making it complicated

98
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:21,239
and if we start making it complicated
 

99
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,990
and if we start making it complicated
this is the first

100
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
this is the first
 

101
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,030
this is the first
this is the second

102
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
this is the second
 

103
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,150
this is the second
because we think about stepping back it

104
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
because we think about stepping back it
 

105
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,970
because we think about stepping back it
means this gets a bit a little bit late

106
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:31,980
means this gets a bit a little bit late
 

107
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,850
means this gets a bit a little bit late
sometimes we do that we step in back

108
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:34,860
sometimes we do that we step in back
 

109
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,830
sometimes we do that we step in back
while we're lifting this

110
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:36,840
while we're lifting this
 

111
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,430
while we're lifting this
so we do that it's like pulling a fish

112
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
so we do that it's like pulling a fish
 

113
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,070
so we do that it's like pulling a fish
out of the sea

114
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,080
out of the sea
 

115
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,009
out of the sea
since we do that

116
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:46,019
since we do that
 

117
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,750
since we do that
if you think of the first degree

118
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:50,760

 

119
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,250

first of all the

120
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,260

 

121
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,430

second super early but notice my body is

122
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,440
second super early but notice my body is
 

123
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,949
second super early but notice my body is
up one

124
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959

 

125
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,830

so when you do the third super early the

126
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
so when you do the third super early the
 

127
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:13,130
so when you do the third super early the
body stays where it is

128
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,140

 

129
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,369

back to the seconds of Brewery

130
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:16,379
back to the seconds of Brewery
 

131
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,070
back to the seconds of Brewery
back to the first

132
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,080
back to the first
 

133
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,350
back to the first
complete

134
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
complete
 

135
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,350
complete
so we make a pattern that our body can

136
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
so we make a pattern that our body can
 

137
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,030
so we make a pattern that our body can
remember

138
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,040
remember
 

139
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,330
remember
what one am I doing oh yeah

140
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,340
what one am I doing oh yeah
 

141
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,670
what one am I doing oh yeah
so I mean you can just quickly switch

142
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
so I mean you can just quickly switch
 

143
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,589
so I mean you can just quickly switch
because you've only got switched the

144
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
because you've only got switched the
 

145
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,850
because you've only got switched the
second half

146
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:37,860

 

147
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,710

as I do in the second or third I don't

148
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720
as I do in the second or third I don't
 

149
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,530
as I do in the second or third I don't
know because I'm in The Cutting position

150
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:42,540
know because I'm in The Cutting position
 

151
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,270
know because I'm in The Cutting position
of the second

152
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:50,280

 

153
00:03:50,280 --> 00:04:05,830

foreign

154
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840

 

155
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,949

it's easy because they all feel the same

156
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
it's easy because they all feel the same
 

157
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,990
it's easy because they all feel the same
apart from

158
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
apart from
 

159
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,809
apart from
the small piece at the end

160
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
the small piece at the end
 

161
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,330
the small piece at the end
if you break them down as I say if you

162
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,340
if you break them down as I say if you
 

163
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,449
if you break them down as I say if you
break them down you get

164
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:20,459
break them down you get
 

165
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,730
break them down you get
ah this is the first sometimes

166
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,740

 

167
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,210

you'll get this for the second

168
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,220
you'll get this for the second
 

169
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,450
you'll get this for the second
and then you do this

170
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,460
and then you do this
 

171
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,450
and then you do this
so the timing is wrong but sometimes

172
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,460
so the timing is wrong but sometimes
 

173
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,749
so the timing is wrong but sometimes
you'll get this for the third because

174
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:38,759
you'll get this for the third because
 

175
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,030
you'll get this for the third because
this is the right way of doing it but

176
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
this is the right way of doing it but
 

177
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,249
this is the right way of doing it but
