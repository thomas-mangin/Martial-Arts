1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,110

so um the kazushi geometry so what

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
so um the kazushi geometry so what
 

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,190
so um the kazushi geometry so what
what's happening to you is you're doing

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
what's happening to you is you're doing
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,589
what's happening to you is you're doing
the technique you're doing EO you're

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
the technique you're doing EO you're
 

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,709
the technique you're doing EO you're
doing

8
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719

 

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,590

uh uh and because the way we are when we

10
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
uh uh and because the way we are when we
 

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,189
uh uh and because the way we are when we
start training we just learning

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
start training we just learning
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,349
start training we just learning
techniques and you're doing the

14
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:20,359
techniques and you're doing the
 

15
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,509
techniques and you're doing the
technique but you want to do the

16
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:22,519
technique but you want to do the
 

17
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,670
technique but you want to do the
concepts the concept you do the concepts

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
concepts the concept you do the concepts
 

19
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,950
concepts the concept you do the concepts
coincidentally the technique manifest as

20
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:27,960
coincidentally the technique manifest as
 

21
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,990
coincidentally the technique manifest as
opposed to I'm going to do the technique

22
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
opposed to I'm going to do the technique
 

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,509
opposed to I'm going to do the technique
it's a totally different way of looking

24
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
it's a totally different way of looking
 

25
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,830
it's a totally different way of looking
at it so we know uh in that we're going

26
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
at it so we know uh in that we're going
 

27
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,630
at it so we know uh in that we're going
to be using the front award kazushi so

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
to be using the front award kazushi so
 

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,830
to be using the front award kazushi so
that means that I have to start this

30
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
that means that I have to start this
 

31
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,310
that means that I have to start this
fight uh

32
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
fight uh
 

33
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,470
fight uh
rotating this

34
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
rotating this
 

35
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,189
rotating this
way such that I get a tilt on his body

36
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:50,199
way such that I get a tilt on his body

proportion in which centrifugal energy
 

41
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,470
proportion in which centrifugal energy
is pulling outward on it and I am

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
is pulling outward on it and I am
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,030
is pulling outward on it and I am
using I key to generate a centri energy

44
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
using I key to generate a centri energy
 

45
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,870
using I key to generate a centri energy
that's what generates the cental energy

46
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:07,880
that's what generates the cental energy
 

47
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,870
that's what generates the cental energy
and then I project the

48
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:11,880
and then I project the
 

49
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,950
and then I project the
center perpendicular to the axis of the

50
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:15,960
center perpendicular to the axis of the
 

51
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,109
center perpendicular to the axis of the
Spiral that I just

52
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:18,119
Spiral that I just
 

53
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,789
Spiral that I just
created you guys get that that's what

54
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
created you guys get that that's what
 

55
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,230
created you guys get that that's what
you do every time so I'm not going to go

56
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,240
you do every time so I'm not going to go
 

57
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,469
you do every time so I'm not going to go
over

58
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
over
 

59
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,910
over
here and then

60
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
here and then
 

61
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,350
here and then
push straight on that

62
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
push straight on that
 

63
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,590
push straight on that
180 you guys see that that's it looks

64
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:34,600
180 you guys see that that's it looks
 

65
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,630
180 you guys see that that's it looks
like the technique but it's not the

66
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
like the technique but it's not the
 

67
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,910
like the technique but it's not the
technique so you're

68
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:38,920
technique so you're
 

69
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,789
technique so you're
here and you're just accelerating that

70
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:41,799
here and you're just accelerating that
 

71
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,749
here and you're just accelerating that
way that's not what we're

72
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759

 

73
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,830

doing you're going to start this thing

74
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
doing you're going to start this thing
 

75
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,310
doing you're going to start this thing
rotating this is why I'm moving this way

76
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
rotating this is why I'm moving this way
 

77
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,590
rotating this is why I'm moving this way
you see his head came this way and then

78
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
you see his head came this way and then
 

79
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,230
you see his head came this way and then
this hand projects to the center at that

80
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,240
this hand projects to the center at that
 

81
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,270
this hand projects to the center at that
angle

82
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
angle
 

83
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,910
angle
okay and you see his body's in a

84
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:02,920
okay and you see his body's in a
 

85
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,830
okay and you see his body's in a
different

86
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840

 

87
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,790

place same thing on the Pama we're doing

88
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:09,800
place same thing on the Pama we're doing
 

89
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,869
place same thing on the Pama we're doing
okay as I'm here we pay attention what

90
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
okay as I'm here we pay attention what
 

91
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,509
okay as I'm here we pay attention what
I'm doing here here he touched the attmy

92
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:16,519
I'm doing here here he touched the attmy
 

93
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm doing here here he touched the attmy
so I'm using that hand here inside the

94
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
so I'm using that hand here inside the
 

95
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,430
so I'm using that hand here inside the
grip I'm using the grip and you can see

96
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
grip I'm using the grip and you can see
 

97
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,110
grip I'm using the grip and you can see
his head is now moving towards me ever

98
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,120
his head is now moving towards me ever
 

99
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,070
his head is now moving towards me ever
so slightly it's not on the 180 it's

100
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,080
so slightly it's not on the 180 it's
 

101
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,790
so slightly it's not on the 180 it's
moving towards me

102
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
moving towards me
 

103
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,790
moving towards me
me there's the spiral and then the

104
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:33,800
me there's the spiral and then the
 

105
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,790
me there's the spiral and then the
projection through the center and you're

106
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
projection through the center and you're
 

107
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:56,509
projection through the center and you're
just doing that

108
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:56,519

 

109
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,309

time this is different

110
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319

 

111
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,309

there's less reaction in it because

112
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
there's less reaction in it because
 

113
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,110
there's less reaction in it because
there's less forces working on his basis

114
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,120
there's less forces working on his basis
 

115
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,990
there's less forces working on his basis
for

116

for
okay bring it in you make sure his head

118
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:13,959
okay bring it in you make sure his head
 

119
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,190
okay bring it in you make sure his head
comes off that 126 line it's indicative

120
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
comes off that 126 line it's indicative
 

121
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,070
comes off that 126 line it's indicative
of the

Spiral which is indicative of the
 

125
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,750
Spiral which is indicative of the
centrifugal cental energies that work

centrifugal cental energies that work
 

127
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,229
centrifugal cental energies that work
which now gives me my Axis at which I

128
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
which now gives me my Axis at which I

let's do a little iner in here

134
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
let's do a little iner in here
 

135
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,030
let's do a little iner in here
um so as the guy's coming in he' have

136
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
um so as the guy's coming in he' have
 

137
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,350
um so as the guy's coming in he' have
this hand so as he's coming in and I'm

138
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,360
this hand so as he's coming in and I'm
 

139
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,350
this hand so as he's coming in and I'm
starting this spiral that we just talked

140
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
starting this spiral that we just talked
 

141
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,350
starting this spiral that we just talked
about okay and then I'm going to project

142
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,360
about okay and then I'm going to project
 

143
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,110
about okay and then I'm going to project
on this now here's what happens to to

144
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
on this now here's what happens to to
 

145
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,190
on this now here's what happens to to
the UK

146
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,200
the UK
 

147
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,789

they have a pattern in their
 

153
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,910
they have a pattern in their
head and that pattern tells

154
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:12,920
head and that pattern tells
 

155
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,830
head and that pattern tells
them that that knee is going to be

156
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:16,840
them that that knee is going to be
 

157
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,749
them that that knee is going to be
there and this center of gravity is

158
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:20,759
there and this center of gravity is
 

159

rotate along the radius it is on now so

162
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:26,600
rotate along the radius it is on now so
 

163
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,790
rotate along the radius it is on now so
they all picture that it just rolls out

164
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
they all picture that it just rolls out

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,240

 

171
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,830

go the problem that comes up is when I'm

172
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
go the problem that comes up is when I'm
 

173
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,590
go the problem that comes up is when I'm
projecting that you're going to on that

174
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
projecting that you're going to on that
 

175
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,270
projecting that you're going to on that
line that I told you right the

176
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,280
line that I told you right the
 

177
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,710
line that I told you right the
perpendicular line to the axis rotation

178
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
perpendicular line to the axis rotation
 

179
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,710
perpendicular line to the axis rotation
of the

180
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:53,720
of the
 

181
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,270
of the
Spiral it's not that radius is going to

182
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
Spiral it's not that radius is going to
 

183
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,469
Spiral it's not that radius is going to
lengthen so he doesn't get to to go

184
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
lengthen so he doesn't get to to go
 

185
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,950
lengthen so he doesn't get to to go
right

186
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:01,960
right
 

187
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,550
right
there there'll be even if it's just an

188
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:05,560
there there'll be even if it's just an
 

189
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,029
there there'll be even if it's just an
inch there'll be

190
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:08,039
inch there'll be
 

191
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,749
inch there'll be
some movement of the center across the

00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
some movement of the center across the
 

193
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,390
some movement of the center across the
sagittal plane on that one I think it

194
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
sagittal plane on that one I think it
 

195
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,870
sagittal plane on that one I think it
was about 4 in okay do do you guys see

196
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:17,880
was about 4 in okay do do you guys see
 

197
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,189
was about 4 in okay do do you guys see
that all right

198
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:20,199
that all right
 

199
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,430
that all right
so because the ego Tri parti mind is

200
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:24,440
so because the ego Tri parti mind is
 

201
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,390
so because the ego Tri parti mind is
afraid it seeks control in its will

202
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,400
afraid it seeks control in its will

and they will start hyper Yin yielding

206
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:34,919
and they will start hyper Yin yielding
 

207
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,749
and they will start hyper Yin yielding
there do you see and then they're trying

208
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
there do you see and then they're trying
 

209
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,629
there do you see and then they're trying
to get it to have the same radius that

210
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:41,639
to get it to have the same radius that
 

211
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,710
to get it to have the same radius that
they

212
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
they
 

213
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,350
they
desire all

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
desire all
 

215
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,430
desire all
right and that is more the case when you

216
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:48,440
right and that is more the case when you
 

217
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,390
right and that is more the case when you

without my weapons between him and I so

258
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,520
without my weapons between him and I so
 

259
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,790
without my weapons between him and I so
he can grab my GR

260
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
he can grab my GR

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,150
he can grab my GR
you see he starts to fall over he'll

262
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
you see he starts to fall over he'll

go into that Center do you do you feel
 

305
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,110
go into that Center do you do you feel
that okay as he starts to I'm going to

that okay as he starts to I'm going to
 

307
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,110
that okay as he starts to I'm going to
do it here where you watch his center

308
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
do it here where you watch his center
 

309
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,230
do it here where you watch his center
it's going to go into his Center you can

310
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
it's going to go into his Center you can
 

311
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,830
it's going to go into his Center you can
even it's going to go into the

bend that arm you just have to follow

316
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
bend that arm you just have to follow
 

317
