00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,950
As we commemorate the first anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake,
 together with the people gathered here today,

2
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:41,600
I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the many 
people who lost their lives in this earthquake.

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:53,150
A year ago today, Japan was unexpectedly struck by a huge earthquake and tsunami,

4
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:01,500
which resulted in almost twenty thousand dead and missing persons.

5
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:10,040
We must not forget that this included many people, such as fire fighters,

6
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,480
who lost their lives as they devoted themselves to relief operations 

7
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:24,470
and disaster control without regard for their own safety.

8
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,330
As this earthquake and tsunami caused the nuclear power plant accident, 

9
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:49,280
those living in areas designated as the danger zone lost their homes 
and livelihoods, and had to leave the places they used to live.

10
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,930
In order for them to live there again safely, 

11
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:04,040
we have to overcome the problem of radioactive contamination, which is a formidable task.

12
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,170
After the earthquake, many people, including members of the Government 

13
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:19,020
and of the local authorities as well as many volunteers, 

14
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:28,730
went to the afflicted areas and carried out various efforts to support the afflicted people.

15
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:39,810
I am sure their activities helped to comfort the evacuees living under harsh conditions

16
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,490
and encouraged them to think positively about the future. 

17
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:55,920
I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude 
to the people who have worked for the afflicted people

18
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:06,100
and ravaged regions, and to those who have been trying to 
contain the damage from the nuclear power plant accident.

19
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:20,050
Many people overseas responded to the disaster 
by sending us relief teams and offering us help in various ways. 

20
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,330
In many cables of sympathy that I received from the foreign heads of state,

21
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,330
they commented on how truly impressed they were by how, under severe conditions, 

22
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:42,700
the afflicted people were helping each other and 
working towards reconstruction with a strong sense of solidarity. 

23
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:53,920
I am deeply grateful for the kindness shown by the people around the world.

24
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:06,120
It is expected that many difficult challenges lie ahead in the reconstruction of the afflicted areas. 

25
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,530
It is my hope that the people's hearts will always be with the afflicted people and regions, 

26
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:22,270
and that everyone will continue to work towards improving the conditions of those areas. 

27
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,450
It is important for us to never forget this disaster and to learn the lessons for the future generations,

28
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:42,770
and foster the proper attitude towards disaster prevention, in the aim of making our country a safer place.

29
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:54,860
In closing, I would like to express my hope that Japan will become once again 
a country where people can live with a sense of security

30
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,890
and again offer my sincere condolences for all those who lost their lives in the Great East Japan Earthquake.
