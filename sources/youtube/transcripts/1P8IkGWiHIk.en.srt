00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840

 

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:38,580

so

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800

 

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,069

turn this

8
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079

 

9
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,349

all right so uh i i can't wrestle

10
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
all right so uh i i can't wrestle
 

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,710
all right so uh i i can't wrestle
him all right so his

12
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
him all right so his
 

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,350
him all right so his
his initial energy there's a yield and

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
his initial energy there's a yield and
 

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,149
his initial energy there's a yield and
then boom

16
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
then boom
 

17
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,710
then boom
there is a ground vectoring there's a

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
there is a ground vectoring there's a
 

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,350
there is a ground vectoring there's a
cochlea

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
cochlea
 

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,469
cochlea
yield pop and then when i do that i

22
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
yield pop and then when i do that i
 

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,950
yield pop and then when i do that i
don't need tension in my arms

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
don't need tension in my arms
 

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,109
don't need tension in my arms
easy

00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119

 

27
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,270

so first of all you produce it and then

00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
you're gonna have another one
 

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,950
you're gonna have another one

oh and he'll hit your hand as he tries
to get his height

42
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
to get his height
 

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,149
to get his height
i'm not here shoving this down i wait

44
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
i'm not here shoving this down i wait
 

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,950

for him to get up
that's what causes that then here

48
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
that's what causes that then here
 

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,310
that's what causes that then here
i move to where that's going to be in

50
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
i move to where that's going to be in
 

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,429
i move to where that's going to be in
place

52
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
place
 

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,230
place
i don't turn this i move to where it's

54
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
i don't turn this i move to where it's
 

55

00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
going to be
 

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,109
going to be
and then i'm just waiting for him to

58
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
and then i'm just waiting for him to
 

59
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,069
and then i'm just waiting for him to
come around

60
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079

 

61
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,190

so boom around

62
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
so boom around
 

63
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,229
so boom around
up help you move in place wait for him

64
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239

 

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:32,470

so no contestation

66
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480

 

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,509

don't wrestle this down

68
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
don't wrestle this down
 

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,270
don't wrestle this down
go around go around

70
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
go around go around
 

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,190
go around go around
go around boom

72
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200

 

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,869

it's subtle but it's there oh

74
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
it's subtle but it's there oh
 

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:03:02,830
it's subtle but it's there oh
go around it

76
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840

 

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:16,830

here

78
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:27,830

here

80
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840

 

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,589

so the concept of wu wei is not to do

82
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
so the concept of wu wei is not to do
 

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,869
so the concept of wu wei is not to do
anything yet it happens okay so

84
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
anything yet it happens okay so
 

85
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,670
anything yet it happens okay so
but better to do the right action so do

86
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
but better to do the right action so do
 

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,309
but better to do the right action so do
the right

88
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
the right
 

89
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,630
the right
action that allows for what's happening

90
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
action that allows for what's happening
 

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,670
action that allows for what's happening
to happen

92
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
to happen
 

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,030
to happen
okay so uh when you're here

94
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
okay so uh when you're here
 

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,550
okay so uh when you're here
you get that second boom you

96
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
you get that second boom you
 

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,789
you get that second boom you
this this hand if you look at it

98
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
this this hand if you look at it
 

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,670
this this hand if you look at it
somewhere in space it's already in the

100
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
somewhere in space it's already in the
 

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,309
somewhere in space it's already in the
nicu

102
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
nicu
 

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,670
nicu
on my shoulder okay

104
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
on my shoulder okay
 

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,830
on my shoulder okay
but i can move in some weird places

106
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
but i can move in some weird places
 

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,830
but i can move in some weird places
where it's not

108
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
where it's not
 

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,470
where it's not
so this right where it is

110
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
so this right where it is
 

111
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,149
so this right where it is
that's where i'm going to try to put my

112
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
that's where i'm going to try to put my
 

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,390
that's where i'm going to try to put my
shoulder okay

114
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
shoulder okay
 

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,429
shoulder okay
i mean how it is don't move it don't

116
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
i mean how it is don't move it don't
 

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,550
i mean how it is don't move it don't
require any grip strength

118
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
require any grip strength
 

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,550
require any grip strength
by leaving it where it is and instead

120
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
by leaving it where it is and instead
 

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,150
by leaving it where it is and instead
move where that goes without any turning

122
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
move where that goes without any turning
 

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,950
move where that goes without any turning
of it

124
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960

 

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,670

right here i want it to be

126
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
right here i want it to be
 

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,390
right here i want it to be
where i don't have to turn it i don't

128
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
where i don't have to turn it i don't
 

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,469
where i don't have to turn it i don't
need any strength at all

130
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
need any strength at all
 

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,670
need any strength at all
and then when i get here then i have

132
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
and then when i get here then i have
 

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,710
and then when i get here then i have
this three contact grip okay

134
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
this three contact grip okay
 

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,670
this three contact grip okay
and again if he stays here no problem

136
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
and again if he stays here no problem
 

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,310
and again if he stays here no problem
but

138
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
but
 

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,550
but
in the technique he comes around to a

140
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
in the technique he comes around to a
 

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,710
in the technique he comes around to a
grass and that's when he puts himself in

142
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
grass and that's when he puts himself in
 

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,990
grass and that's when he puts himself in
the technique

144
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000

 

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,670

so

146
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680

 

147
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,270

in this

148
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
in this
 

149
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,590
in this
leave it where it is feel whether you

150
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
leave it where it is feel whether you
 

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,950
leave it where it is feel whether you
need torque

152
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
need torque
 

153
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,070
need torque
or thumb pressure or grip pressure and

154
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
or thumb pressure or grip pressure and
 

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,629
or thumb pressure or grip pressure and
that

156
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
that
 

157
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,150
that
where you move where you don't have

158
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
where you move where you don't have
 

159
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,830
where you move where you don't have
those things

160
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
those things
 

161
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,480
those things
that's where enikio is

162
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,490
that's where enikio is
 

163
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:57,350
that's where enikio is
[Music]

164
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360

 

165
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,950

all right so here you have this

166
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
all right so here you have this
 

167
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,790
all right so here you have this
small window of opportunity okay

168
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
small window of opportunity okay
 

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,070
small window of opportunity okay
and you're not gonna crank this guy

170
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080

 

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,430

you're not gonna get it so you just stop

172
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
you're not gonna get it so you just stop
 

173
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,950
you're not gonna get it so you just stop
it from going down

174
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
it from going down
 

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,189
it from going down
okay and you go around it you see

176
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
okay and you go around it you see
