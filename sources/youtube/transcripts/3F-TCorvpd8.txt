oh coming forward it's looking fine
but i'm not saying you push
here that stretch there you need to push
your
mass so i'd like you to think about what
we were doing in the exercise
and when this comes forward
i actually can see some weight here
in your step not just not just a
step and a powerful see if i see a
powerful
strike it's showing me that it's all up
here and the bottle is the wrong way up
again
so here
this is it all of this look
all of this is going
and the joe comes out of that power
some of you are
[Music]
comes from the power not the other way
around
