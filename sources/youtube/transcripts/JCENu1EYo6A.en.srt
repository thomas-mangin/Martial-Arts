1
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,340
Why? By chance...

2
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,920
When I was 9 years old, I lived next to the Cercle Tissier in Vincennes.

3
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,480
I had a friend who was doing Aikido brought me to the Cercle Tissier.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,100
I sat on the edge of the tatami and watched a class

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,480
and I asked to be registered on the spot, twice per week.

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,440
It was unusual at the time because children usually practiced once a week.

7
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,320
I fell into it when I was little.

8
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,860
I started in 1989,

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,880
it's going to be my 30th year of practice, all of it at the Cercle Tissier.

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,080
I went to all the classes at the Cercle,

11
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,020
I did the children's classes, the teenagers classes, the adult classes, the weapons classes.

12
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,000
When I turned 17, I started the weapons classes so here it is.

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
It's been thirty years of practice with Christian and with his students who taught at the Cercle.

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,160
No, there aren't that many.

15
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,340
There are few who have such a long experience.

16
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,200
For instance, the children who started with me all stopped.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,520
I don't know any who have continued

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,600
and unfortunately this is still the case from generation to generation, there are some who continue but not many...

19
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,340
What I notice though, is that people who started early

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,900
often end up becoming professionals, or teach classes,

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,140
or get invested in the discipline for a long time,

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,100
but there are few, it's true.

23
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,280
So, I'll start with the pros...

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,680
It's the largest European center for Aikido,

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,860
there are many people, there are many different levels,

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,200
there are many high level people of course,

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,060
there are many teachers there, so it's challenging from the get go.

28
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,240
There are beginners classes in Vincennes though,

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,140
which allows to have some scaffolding before getting to the big yard.

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,100
So that's a real opportunity to progress quickly

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,340
because you are with people who practice well,

32
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,880
with good teachers,

33
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,280
but the drawback is that you have to hang on because it's a bit hard,

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,300
the level is high, the pace of practice is fast...

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,960
Excellence is demanding so it takes a special king of people who are ready to commit to it.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,080
It is true that people who come only for leisure

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,280
will have a little a harder time staying long in this particular club.

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,120
Yes and no because he tries to be present very regularly when he's not in teaching abroad,

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,560
which requires him to be absent in the week,

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,420
but he has a regularity of presence about which we can be honored and proud

41
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,300
because it is does that every week and it's not easy for him I think.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
So he's still very, very present.

43
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,540
the chance we have is to have since ...

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,480
We're also lucky in that even though some teachers who have changed of course

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
but to have a regularity in the teachers who are there.

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,460
I think of Pascal, Bruno, Fabrice who have been here for years,

47
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,100
but we had other teachers too who were there for a long time

48
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,700
and who built the foundations...

49
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,720
That's the richness of this place, having Christian's teaching twice a week,

50
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,640
but supplemented by a number of teachers who are there to ensure...

51
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,260
At the time it was Pascal and Bruno who took care of the basics for Christian

52
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
so that he can do teach the more advanced material.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Today it has evolved a bit, that is to say that

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,880
each teacher having also gone up the ranks, each one does more of his personal work

55
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,880
so in that sense maybe there are fewer teachers who teach the basics

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,780
and a little bit more...

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,580
It may be a bit more diverse in the ways of teaching, maybe that's what has evolved.

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,820
But Christian's presence is just as important today compared to when I started.

59
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,180
In the atmosphere, yes, certainly.

60
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,880
I have to put that in context: When I started going to adult classes, I was 14

61
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,940
I was with my brown belt and my hakama,

62
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,980
the first 3 years, until I got my black belt were very very difficult

63
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,520
because the teaching was perhaps harder, more physical

64
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,380
physical in the sense a little "rough"

65
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,960
so I got hurt quite a bit.

66
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,740
The protocol was perhaps much stricter too.

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,400
It was a little harder overall.

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,140
The relationships between people were hard too

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,400
Today the relationships are technical, tonic, physical,

70
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,820
but perhaps more benevolent.

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,180
People are a bit more caring with each other,

72
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,960
men towards women, women towards each other...

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,920
I have known a time when women were hard with each other,

74
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,420
women were tough with men, men...

75
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,740
It was a hard environment overall.

76
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,380
In terms of physical relationships but even more so in terms of human relationships

77
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,840
and that was the hardest thing.

78
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
Today, of course I don't have the same level, nor the same experience,

79
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,760
we should ask people who start nowadays...

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,640
I think it's still hard for them

81
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,320
but it's hard because the technical level and the expectations are high.

82
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,940
I think that it's in the relations between people that it has evolved in a good way.

83
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,740
This is not only my opinion, I heard it from several generations of practitioners

84
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,360
and female practitioners especially.

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
I think it has evolved...

86
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,600
It's still as intense

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
but more caring,

88
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
I would say more caring.

89
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,680
The technical coherence is still there, of course,

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,180
because the people who teach at the Cercle are students of Christian

91
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,500
so there is a definite consistency,

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,660
but those are people who have evolved in their practice

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,120
so they don't teach now in the same way as they taught before.

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,640
Obviously Christian's teaching has evolved as well.

95
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,440
But...

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,600
There might have been more of a direct connection in the classes we did Monday to Friday,

97
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,020
because I was doing all the classes of the Cercle.

98
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,440
There was maybe more of a systematic repetition,

99
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
suwari, hanmi handachi, tachi waza...

100
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,860
I remember classes with Bruno where we did a lot of suwari waza and hanmi handachi waza,

101
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,880
which really gave us the keys to practice afterwards in tachi waza.

102
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,920
Maybe today they all teach a little less on their knees so maybe we do less of it.

103
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,380
They don't have the same level either, so they don't teach the same things.

104
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:35,200
So it's possible that the discourse is now more geared towards people who have already learned the basics elsewhere.

105
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,500
Perhaps they're less lost.

106
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,540
While before, it was perhaps easier to catch up.

107
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,660
That's a feeling that I have.

108
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,240
GE: Because in terms of staff it's the same people?

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,220
It's roughly the same people, Pascal, Bruno, Fabrice, and Patrick as well.

110
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,120
Patrick Benezzi has been teaching for a long time.

111
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,800
Philippe Orban also taught, but he's no longer there now,

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,720
Daniel Bourguignon who was teaching the Friday night class, who's no longer there now,

113
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,500
Philippe Bersani who taught weapons classes, who's not either ...

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Some teachers have come and gone, but...

115
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,040
Marc Bachraty also taught at the Cercle,

116
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,860
but for people who've been practicing for a long time,

117
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,160
we've had the same teachers for 15 - 20 years yes, it didn't change...

118
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,760
Teachers have moved in their teaching and in their practice, of course, but...

119
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,700
When I met Pascal, he must have been 2nd or 3rd dan, now he is 6th dan,

120
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
same for Bruno,

121
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,120
so obviously it's not the same context

122
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:39,360
and perhaps today the teachers allow themselves a more personal research.

123
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,920
Ah it's hard to evaluate...

124
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,580
The economic circumstances have changed a little too.

125
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,560
I think there are fewer people who can afford, economically or in terms of time,

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
to do all the classes of the Cercle, there are was fewer than before.

127
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,800
There are also fewer visitors from abroad than before,

128
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,080
I remember people coming from Poland, Germany,

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,400
who stayed months and months sleeping at the dojo,

130
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,940
it's still less frequent.

131
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,620
More people do round-trips, but fewer spend several months in the dojo, for sure.

132
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,940
I think it's more to do with economic circumstances than anything else.

133
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,960
I terms of people from the Cercle,

134
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,560
it's a bit more difficult to evaluate because there are people who come at lunchtime,

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
and others come in the evenings.

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,220
It's not like it's two different clubs, but there's a bit of that.

137
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,440
Many teachers come at noon because for us it's convenient,

138
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,480
we have our classes at night, so we come to train during lunchtime,

139
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,860
and the people who come more as a hobby come after work.

140
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,800
I think there's still a large number of people who are form the Cercle Tissier,

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,700
but in terms of people who take all the classes,

142
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,700
I think it's about 20 people at most.

143
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:08,120
People who do all the classes, all the seminars, and who also train outside the dojo, wherever Christian goes.

144
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,680
It's probably about 20 peoples our of the while lot.

145
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,080
The number a the Cercle Tissier is much more important than that.

146
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,400
No, as Christian says, I am a pure product of Vincennes.

147
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
I didn't spread myself.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,300
Having started as a child, the logic was to do everything that Christian did, so I followed him in seminars a lot.

149
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,880
I also followed Pascal Guillemin a lot,

150
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Bruno's seminars, a little less,

151
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,280
but it was the norm to follow the deshi in their seminars.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,300
So for my training, I mostly did the classes at the Cercle,

153
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,080
and seminars with Christian.

154
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Unlike many moms, it's when I got my first boy

155
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
that I switched to completely to doing Aikido,

156
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,740
because Fabrice doing the same thing,

157
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,880
we had a symmetry in our schedules that allowed us to take care of our children

158
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,460
a lot during the day since we work during lunchtimes, evenings, and weekends,

159
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,740
so we can really take care of the all the rest of the time.

160
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,040
I worked a lot before in the industry of the games and the toys

161
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,920
I liked it a lot, I worked in game libraries, toy stores, game events,

162
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,120
that's something that speaks to me and that is important to me,

163
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,980
but, as I went along, I had more and more responsibilities, classes, seminars to teach,

164
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,880
and when I gave birth to my first child...

165
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,840
I never really decided it but it was in the logic of things to switch completely,

166
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,660
like Fabrice, as an aikido professional to harmonize our schedules

167
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,040
and take care of our children.

168
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,180
Yes, Fabrice has his dojo in Montreuil, in the suburbs, where I teach children's classes,

169
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,339
and I opened a dojo ten ago years in the south of Paris,

170
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,489
near the Place d'Italie where I started ...

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,409
it's a municipal dojo, so I started with two students and after ten years,

172
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,290
I am very happy because we are more than 100 adults.

173
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,320
So it's a dojo that's starting to run well.

174
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,460
Some have been there since the beginning

175
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,500
but because of my curriculum, a lot of people also come from outside.

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,840
In the past few years, the dojo got more populated,

177
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,220
with people who are 4th dan, or 5th dan sometimes,

178
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,740
who come to follow my teaching in addition to what they do in their own dojo.

179
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,400
I have teachers who come too, so it gives density

180
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,560
and of course additional responsibilities to the teaching,

181
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,940
but after 10 years

182
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,600
there is a part of the groundwork of the dojo that's been established, and it's very pleasing.

183
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,100
For now, I'm trying to really stay present...

184
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,260
The dojo is still too recent,

185
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,740
I haven't trained people yet who are able to substitute for me, with the adequate credentials.

186
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,080
People still have to move up the ranks and get diplomas.

187
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,240
So I'm always present for my classes,

188
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,660
but it's true that I have more and more seminars to give on weekends,

189
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,260
I have a little over twenty seminars to teach,

190
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,360
in the future it will be the real challenge to be attentive to both.

191
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,200
But it's true that it's starting now, since I've been appointed this year as director...

192
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,460
-- No, what is it called now? It'S not called DTR... --

193
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm Regional Technical Referent for Normandy,

194
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,520
following the reform of the Technical College of our Federation,

195
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,160
so I'm going to have extra responsibilities

196
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,420
so more obligations and more seminars...

197
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,240
I also have a few seminars abroad which are becoming regular,

198
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,420
so it's creating interesting new opportunities,

199
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:13,040
but it will take a little rigor to be able to run things seriously,

200
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,080
and so that no one is left out.

201
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,040
It seems important to me that the people of the dojo...

202
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,980
don't feel "abandoned" because it is still the foundation of the practice,

203
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,020
for a teacher,

204
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,860
in my opinion it's his dojo that's the most important,

205
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,860
the people he trains, how he teaches, who will keep practicing in future...

206
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,400
Seminars are great, it's very good to promote one's practice, but the base is the dojo.

207
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,020
I believe that what keeps the desire for practice

208
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,220
is simply the joy of being on a tatami...

209
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,940
The joy of doing the movements, of being kneaded, of kneading others,

210
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,520
it's simple things, really, I think we shouldn't look ...

211
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,520
In my case, I'm not looking for what isn't there.

212
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,960
It's a simple pleasure,

213
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,360
and consequently, it's easy enough to get back to it.

214
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
We don't ask too many questions

215
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,240
even if, obviously, there are moments when it's more difficult than others to step on the tatami.

216
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,380
It's not that we get demotivated, but we can have pain everywhere, we can be less inspired,

217
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,900
it's important to take breaks from time to time as well,

218
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,700
to keep moments without Aikido, to renew one's inspiration, I think...

219
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,200
It brings me a lot of serenity I think.

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
It's the right word, a lot of stability...

221
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,560
Since Fabrice is doing the same thing, I think we agree a lot, we listen to each other a lot, we support each other a lot,

222
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,120
I think it's very important for us too to be two in the practice.

223
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,140
I think I wouldn't have the same profile if I was a practitioner and my companion wasn't.

224
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,840
We often talk about it with people who are in this situation,

225
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,280
they are the only one practicing, it is not always easy to share

226
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,560
the joys and the sorrows of the tatami, the responsibilities,

227
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,040
Fabrice also has responsibilities, he is DFR of Guyana from this season,

228
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,320
so he too is made to travel a lot.

229
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,920
So we have the same kind of journey and evolution in our journey,

230
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,960
so it allows us to share and stay grounded,

231
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,000
not to go into considerations...

232
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,640
Have ideas...

233
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,020
Staying open, staying simple,

234
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,020
not to think that if we have seminars, more classes, e more students...

235
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,560
Stay humble.

236
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,880
I think it helps to be two also on that, it grounds you.

237
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,320
Yes, it helps a lot for putting things into perspective, especially things that don't go well.

238
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,460
If tomorrow we're no longer Director of a region

239
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,080
or if we have a period when we get less seminars,

240
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,440
or we aren't asked to participate to an event,

241
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,320
it means it was not our job to do it,

242
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,720
or that it wasn't the right time.

243
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,080
I try to stay honest and simple in our practice

244
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,380
without a second thought.

245
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,940
I think that's what characterizes us both,

246
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,820
I speak for Fabrice, but that's the way we see things.

247
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,460
We aren't complicated people.

248
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,760
We like the practice, we like people, we like what we do.

249
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,920
We try to get on with it and to always have joy and envy, simply.

250
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,920
I think there never was.

251
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,920
In 20 years that we are together,

252
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,800
there never was any competition at all.

253
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,540
I consider Fabrice as my sempai

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,680
because he was more senior than me already when I arrived so as teenager,

255
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,700
he was already 1st dan or 2nd, I don't remember,

256
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,520
so for me he was already a model.

257
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,060
I asked him to help me prepare for my 1st dan,

258
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,420
shy, timidly, so that was the beginning of our relationship

259
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,260
but I always had Fabrice as a reference.

260
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,940
I took his classes in Vincennes, I went to his seminars,

261
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,340
I continue to go with pleasure.

262
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,560
Nothing makes me more happy than to do an seminar with Fabrice

263
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,560
so I think there was never any idea of ​​competition between us.

264
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,960
There was already enough of it around us,

265
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,040
or from other people towards us, without us wanting it,

266
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,200
for us to want to put competition in our relationship and as aikidoka.

267
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,900
We've been able to work thewe things out pretty quickly.

268
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,960
When we're both practitioners, we have a relationship as practitioners,

269
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,600
when he is a teacher, I am a student,

270
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,320
We know how to work those things things out,

271
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,040
but in terms of competition,

272
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,120
it never happened,

273
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,760
for neither of us.

274
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,140
Yes it is not trivial because since for us it has been hard when we arrived,

275
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,820
we really didn't want it to happen again for the maximum of people

276
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,920
with whom we were in contact.

277
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,300
That's something that we did deliberately.

278
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,220
We've always worked to try to welcome people,

279
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,720
-- within the limits of our possibilities because we are not omnipresent --

280
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,780
but when we practiced a lot and every day, it was easier of course,

281
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,420
we still have 2 lunchtime classes per week with Christian, we try to continue doing it but

282
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,780
if it's not in Vincennes, it'll be during seminars or other occasions,

283
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,400
any event where we meet people,

284
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
we always try facilitate relationships

285
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,800
without allowing ourselves to be overwhelmed, that's the risk since we are pretty open people.

286
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,560
Within reason, we try to keep friendly relations with people,

287
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,540
but to remain mainly facilitators so that there is a good energy that circulates.

288
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,380
On our small scale, if we can contribute to it,

289
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,080
it's really something we've tried to do, for years actually.

290
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,040
So...

291
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,100
I always have in mind what Christian said,

292
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,700
he often tells us that he didn't learn how to do suwari-waza,

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,140
he was doing shikko, with no indication, no "technique",

294
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,980
so that's why the've damaged their knees a lot...

295
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,220
When we talk with many elders, they tell us:

296
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,620
"We went for it, but we didn't think too much."

297
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,640
Experienced practitioners have often told me that our generations,

298
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,420
are just as physical but also more technical.

299
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,580
So, there is wear and tear, of course, but probably less.

300
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Perhaps we have gained in terms of precision and advice given to students.

301
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,100
In my classes, I always do suwari and hanmi handachi.

302
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,120
I was never taught much how to

303
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,240
how to place the ankles, how to orientate the knees, how to place the hips,

304
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,740
we walked, and that was it.

305
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,820
But I try to give them more precise indications.

306
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,660
Also for front and back falls.

307
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,580
As for me, I just fell. I was not told: "You put your hand like this", "You do like this",

308
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,760
whereas today, yes, I will be much more a pedagogical

309
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,000
on all things to do upstream of the practice,

310
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,980
how to place yourself to fall, start at different levels, maybe on the ground before getting up...

311
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,580
I continue to do it because it's part of my heritage so

312
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,460
I transmit it of course, but with perhaps more instructions and...

313
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,319
safety, for the body, to be able to do it longer.

314
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,580
I hope that it works, we'll talk about it in 20 years, I don't know, maybe I'll have knee pain too.

315
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,560
So perhaps a little more pedagogy and instruction,

316
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,940
maybe it helps to last longer.

317
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm often told...

318
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,860
I do not have the internal sensation, but I'm often told that I have an aikido that is clear and clean.

319
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,580
That it's easy to read, easy to reproduce.

320
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:19,800
It seems difficult to be able to do the same movement four times.

321
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,400
Bruno Gonzalez who told us:

322
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,720
"If you can do the same movement four times without changing any detail,"

323
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,200
"it means that you are able to anchor things in a very structured way."

324
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,040
I kept that in mind and I'm trying to do it,

325
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,000
up to a certain limit, that it doesn't stiffen the body.

326
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,240
The work I'm trying to do is not to break free from the form but it's

327
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,500
to try things out more.

328
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,900
I tell my students to allow themselves to make rough drafts,

329
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,000
to do things that are not beautiful, to do things that are not satisfactory for them,

330
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,660
things a little more direct,

331
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,260
to avoid being in something too polished.

332
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,200
The extreme counterpart of being clear and clean is maybe to be a bit too smooth.

333
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,360
That's what I say to myself.

334
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,540
Perhaps doing things more lively, more natural, more spontaneous,

335
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,240
maybe that's my research for the moment.

336
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,120
I don't have a preconceived idea...

337
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't police myself, I do what I like to do.

338
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Often, if it is a private seminar, I do what I like to do in my dojo at that particular time,

339
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,980
explore a sensation, explore placements,

340
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,260
explore various things that interest me when I do it in my dojo.

341
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,880
I don't have a set idea because it's going to be different, because I'm a woman.

342
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,460
-- I don't want to talk about men's aikido and women's aikido, --

343
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,820
but as a female teacher, necessarily it will be different, presented differently, experienced differently.

344
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,640
I try to practice with people, it's really something that I like to do,

345
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,020
to make me feel.

346
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
I get a lot of inspiration from what Yoko Okamoto does

347
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,360
because it's someone I admire a lot and I like a lot and she does it a lot in her seminars.

348
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,860
She goes with people, she gives a lot of herself, she really conveys it with her body.

349
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,260
I answered an interview not long ago where I said:

350
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,120
"It's true that when I go to meet people during seminars, I try to convince them with my body"

351
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,220
"and not by my speech."

352
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,120
In the end,

353
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,600
in this kind of martial discipline,

354
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
our peer recognize us because we convince them physically.

355
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,660
That's the way I see it.

356
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:44,560
I try to teach by making them feel what I'm doing. That's my idea.

357
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,960
It's complementary to practice, that is to say that I had mostly men teacher.

358
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,340
They were all benevolent, very structuring, and treated me equally,

359
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,880
there was neither positive discrimination nor exclusion at all -- on the part of the teachers at least --.

360
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,660
So I didn't feel any difference in the way I was treated.

361
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,440
So I can say that it would have been just the same, whether I had male or female teachers.

362
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,780
Even so, it's still an easier access door, for a female practitioner,

363
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,500
to have a female referent at the start because it may be more reassuring.

364
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,880
Perhaps the first step will be a bit more difficult,

365
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,360
-- maybe, --

366
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,220
if it's a referent man at the start.

367
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,080
I refer a lot to the classes I give at the university

368
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,800
because I have classes for college students,

369
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
and it turns out that Aikido,

370
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,740
I'm in the martial arts section and I'm the only female teacher.

371
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,560
Last year I had 73 people enrolled

372
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,340
and an overwhelming majority of girls.

373
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,780
So I think that for a beginner, it's a little easier

374
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,700
if at the beginning, they have some female referents, to be able to have options.

375
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,140
After that it's okay.

376
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,540
With the diversity of practice and teaching evens it all.

377
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,700
It's not essential.

378
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,640
That's why, again, that I don't insist on whether teachers are male or female,

379
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,840
they're just teachers.

380
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,580
Perhaps as a first access door, yes, it's easier, maybe.

381
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,340
Maybe yes, with the efforts that are made on all sides, as you said.

382
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,160
On the part of the State, on the part of politicians in general, on the part of the IAF...

383
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,620
Things are changing, the lines move so maybe it creates openings.

384
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,000
Women may realize that they have more opportunities than they thought.

385
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,540
There are many factors.

386
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,100
When I was pregnant,

387
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,380
I continued to practice, in a very careful way, and especially to teach until the end of my pregnancies.

388
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,300
Then the Federation contacted me saying: "Yes, it's true, we hadn't thought of that,"

389
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,640
"but yes, there is a definite possibility that ..."

390
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,360
So I was asked to share my experience to see how far women could remain integrated in the dojos when they were pregnant.

391
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,600
It was not limiting, it was not contraindicated,

392
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,200
if precautions were taken.

393
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,200
So I think the lines are moving and maybe in the future,

394
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,240
we are at the beginning, but there will be more ...

395
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,400
opportunities for women to feel

396
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,820
able, invited, given room, to engage more in practice,

397
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,960
more over the long term, without breaks in practice, yes.

398
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,180
I think there is a bit of both, I think there is still some reluctance, let's face it.

399
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,860
There are both possibilities, that is to say,

400
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,400
they're not given much space because traditionally there is no need for it,

401
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,120
or they're given limited space, during children classes, or limited responsibilities on lower tasks...

402
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,360
On the other hand, there are others...

403
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,180
There is a clash of generations we're on a transition.

404
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,500
There are people who really want

405
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,140
to change things, to bring out a real diversity,

406
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,060
and then there are still pockets of resistance yes, of course.

407
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,060
We haven't finished the transition.

408
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:28,500
It's normal that, in fact, there are still not many high-ranking women yet.

409
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,180
We were discussing with Vilko Vriesman,

410
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,020
about the fact that there will be a generation gap while things change.

411
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,720
Below my generation, there will be a gap,

412
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,480
and then, the base will be reformed.

413
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,560
At the moment, we're lacking young females between 20 and 30 who could take over.

414
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:59,860
Perhaps right now, those females don't yet see that there is a future for them.

415
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,240
It's a hard question indeed ...

416
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,040
I think there are a lot of young people, 18-25 years old,

417
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,360
who are potentially interested in Aikido because that just gives them a way to

418
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,260
to let off steam, to work out, but without competition

419
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,260
because that, really, is something that weighs on them

420
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,580
in their studies, in the pressures for the job after, they have a multitude of things that accumulate.

421
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:37,060
Here they have a discipline that offers them just to free themselves without having any ulterior motive,

422
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,040
or objective, so that, I think that's a real argument in our favor.

423
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:49,040
It sets us apart from judo and Karate

424
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,300
because it's perhaps a little less rough,

425
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,820
which comes from the fact that there is not real combat,

426
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,660
but we need to present things well, because they aren't going to buy into anything.

427
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,540
Perhaps before, we could just be a teacher and students would come to us,

428
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,500
but today's teachers must go a little more out to get the students.

429
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,540
We need to diversify the public and go get the youngsters where they are.

430
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,040
to tell them: "Aikido is good and it will do you good"

431
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,820
"you'll be able to work out and sweat".

432
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,580
In fact, they're looking for an Aikido that is dynamic.

433
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,320
An Aikido that is too intellectual would bore them.

434
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,760
Some of my students also study science, or other technical things,

435
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,740
so they don't want to get into something else really intellectual, they want to let off some steam,

436
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,740
within a framework that suits them, because Aikido is very ritualized and technical.

437
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,260
Perhaps we have a profile of practitioners...

438
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:56,740
Generally, statistical studies on the profile of Aikdio practitioners show that

439
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,160
it doesn't cover all of the socio-professional categories.

440
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,480
It's a fact.

441
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,400
So we have to go and get the youths

442
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,280
because French youths like Japanese culture,

443
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,820
manga, culture, everything...

444
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,240
and the desire to let stem off and free themselves while learning a martial art.

445
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,760
There might also be an aspect of self-defense,

446
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,460
self-confidence, control over one's emotions...

447
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,040
there are many fields in which we have a  public for the next generation.

448
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,600
It's true that the arguments that we used to present,

449
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,380
as something very traditional,

450
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,000
a conception that might have fitted the 70's and 80's,

451
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,100
can't be used at all anymore.

452
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,880
But once again, the youths are really into it.

453
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,560
As an example, they think it's fantastic when a character does Aikido in a show like "The Walking Dead",

454
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,160
or when they find a character that does Aikido in a Japanese series,

455
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,440
In "La Casa de Papel", they have an episode in the 3rd season that talks about Aikido,

456
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,100
it goes viral on social networks before it talks about Aikido for 2 minutes,

457
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:23,880
those are signs that Aikido has a good image

458
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,300
and we need to make use of it.

459
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,940
Whether people are practitioners or not, it interest them that we speak about Aikido in their favorite series.

460
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,600
We need to find a way to communicate that is a little more modern.

461
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,900
A bit more tangible and pragmatic.

462
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,620
We often say that Aikido is a big family.

463
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,160
It's true!

464
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,240
I did volleyball, swimming, and other sport activities,

465
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,640
-- apart from competition, that I'll set aside because I didn't like it at all --

466
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,460
there is a structuring of the Aikido system

467
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:13,440
that seemed very constructive to me as a teenager, even though I couldn't explain it.

468
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,980
Today I can put words on it but back then, it was an intuition,.

469
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,980
I had the feeling that my seniors and sempai, close to me,

470
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,720
people who were below me, and my teachers, all formed a whole.

471
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,200
We were going something together, and that was going to be great.

472
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,560
It's something really structuring and reassuring.

473
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,680
In terms of the richness of relationships between people,

474
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,660
in terms of relationships that run over 10 or 20 years of interactions,

475
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,500
it may be unique...

476
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,940
Out of all the sports activities that I did, that is the most unique thing.

477
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,900
Often, practitioners come...

478
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,160
They come for practice of course, but also for social link that it creates.

479
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,720
For the family that they may not have and a number of other reasons.

480
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,940
I can see now I'm here,

481
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,420
there are some people I know, others that I don't,

482
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,100
there is a sort of emulsion that take place, we take part in the same activities,

483
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,640
we get the feeling to be working on something that is larger than us,

484
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,600
that puts us in the same family beyond frontiers.

485
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,440
It's quite exceptional in Aikido.

486
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,300
We're doing the rehearsals for the demonstration that is going to take place tomorrow for this event in Iwama.

487
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,900
There will be three parts, and I get to go last.

488
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:40,680
There will be one part for basic techniques, one for Iwama-style weapons,

489
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,160
en then a free practice part.

490
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,660
The most time-consuming thing is to work out the etiquette, the bow,

491
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,600
so that everybody is synchronized.

492
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,060
It's not so much for etiquette itself, but so that it looks correct.

493
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,140
This is often what takes the most time during demonstrations,

494
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,300
but not much more than during the usual demonstrations.

495
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,800
It's always like that, we have an intense effort to provide in a short time.

496
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,640
We have to give our best, like in all demonstrations, often without any warm-up.

497
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,860
It's part of the game, as usual.

498
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,440
For people from the IAF, it's a great honor to participate in this,

499
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,220
and it allows to create connections between people on an international level,

500
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,400
and to realize that we're a great family,

501
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,820
and that we participate in something that is larger than us.

502
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,100
We don't always get all the inns and outs of it,

503
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,960
but here, it's a very concrete event so that's very important.
