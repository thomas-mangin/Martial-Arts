that's why we need changes he's pushing

8
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
that's why we need changes he's pushing
 

9
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:34,710
that's why we need changes he's pushing
and I feel but here he went off and I

10
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
and I feel but here he went off and I
 

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,389
and I feel but here he went off and I
keep going I'm going to not have

12
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:36,399
keep going I'm going to not have
 

13
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:43,050
keep going I'm going to not have
anything so I hear he's honored to be

14
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,060
anything so I hear he's honored to be
 

15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,469
anything so I hear he's honored to be
made then he went off on haha he's

16
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:49,479
made then he went off on haha he's
 

17
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,419

to be right here it it would be off you

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,530
to be right here it it would be off you
 

21
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,910
to be right here it it would be off you
think to be disengaged his elbow which

22
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:02,920
think to be disengaged his elbow which
 

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,919
think to be disengaged his elbow which
is fine the morning though I have to

24
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:04,929
is fine the morning though I have to
 

25
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,139
is fine the morning though I have to
find it and they went off again when you

26
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:07,149
find it and they went off again when you
 

27
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,250
find it and they went off again when you
put his way down so I'm feeling for

28
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,260
put his way down so I'm feeling for
 

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,930
put his way down so I'm feeling for
foreign and

30
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:16,940

 

31
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,460

it's what I'm feeling for you let go I

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,470
it's what I'm feeling for you let go I
 

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:32,880
it's what I'm feeling for you let go I
do you ready

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:32,890

 

35
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,470

hey or for pressure of these pushing up

36
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,480
hey or for pressure of these pushing up

it's a link goes like this you're like

38
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:39,800
it's a link goes like this you're like
 

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,170
it's a link goes like this you're like
wow the big guy okay so what you don't

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,180
wow the big guy okay so what you don't
 

41
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,180
wow the big guy okay so what you don't
want to do is now add to that by pushing

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,190
want to do is now add to that by pushing
 

43
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,810
want to do is now add to that by pushing
back on it okay he goes look so I'm

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:52,820
back on it okay he goes look so I'm
 

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,810
back on it okay he goes look so I'm
going to move it where his energy

46
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:57,820
going to move it where his energy
 

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,740
going to move it where his energy
doesn't push me back or pushes him back

48
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:01,750
doesn't push me back or pushes him back
 

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,580
doesn't push me back or pushes him back
okay so i can't go here cuz that's

50
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:06,590
okay so i can't go here cuz that's
 

51
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,590
okay so i can't go here cuz that's
pushing against it and he's stronger

52
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:08,600
pushing against it and he's stronger
 

53
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,810
pushing against it and he's stronger
than me so maybe I go out like you did

54
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:13,820
than me so maybe I go out like you did
 

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,680
than me so maybe I go out like you did
the exact opposite so he pushes hard and

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:17,690
the exact opposite so he pushes hard and
 

57
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,150
the exact opposite so he pushes hard and
I can make movement smaller books versus

58
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,160
I can make movement smaller books versus
 

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,970
I can make movement smaller books versus
on him he's not pushing hard and little

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:27,980
on him he's not pushing hard and little
 

61
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,600
on him he's not pushing hard and little
movements don't do anything because he's

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:31,610
movements don't do anything because he's
 

63
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,390
movements don't do anything because he's
not connected so he has no chance of

64
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
not connected so he has no chance of
 

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,290
not connected so he has no chance of
pushing me over but my response in his

66
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:38,300
pushing me over but my response in his
 

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,840
pushing me over but my response in his
body is smaller but the principle is the

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:40,850
body is smaller but the principle is the
 

69
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,160
body is smaller but the principle is the
same I have to use the energy to

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,170
same I have to use the energy to
 

71
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,860
same I have to use the energy to
manipulate his math okay if I were to do

72
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:50,870
manipulate his math okay if I were to do
 

73
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,380
manipulate his math okay if I were to do
the other one looks nothing but it's

well look his shoulders doing it and

86
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:12,980
well look his shoulders doing it and
 

87
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,030
well look his shoulders doing it and
then it could be the shoulder but it

88
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,040
then it could be the shoulder but it
 

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,020
then it could be the shoulder but it
doesn't have to be the shoulder you see

it's hard for you to figure out so just
 

99
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:41,680
it's hard for you to figure out so just
a little slower versus here no good or

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:41,690
a little slower versus here no good or
 

101

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,339
the elbow act like a hinge and you're
going to lose it so if you end up below

00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:56,349
going to lose it so if you end up below

the arm it has to go more into him see
 

131
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,110
the arm it has to go more into him see
that if i end up above the arm then it's

that if i end up above the arm then it's
 

133
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,469
that if i end up above the arm then it's
still the same thing i'm not going this

140
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:23,409
his center okay so if I'm here it still
 

141
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,640
his center okay so if I'm here it still
has to go into him and this is this is

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:26,650
has to go into him and this is this is

every time okay but the sticking is
