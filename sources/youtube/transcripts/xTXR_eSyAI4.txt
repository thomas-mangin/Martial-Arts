again we have the less dominant form
here so as I come in I feel that I can't
drive them anywhere so I go behind him
as I do this I pull his arm into my body
hyperextending his elbow making him Bend
forward and forward slightly as he does
that he becomes lower than me I then
drive into his shoulder to bring him
down from here again I have three joints
I can easily go into the shoulder by
driving down up and over the elbow
pinching tightly right at the elbow and
pushing into my bicep or folding the
wrist down
one more time at speed
I
am out
