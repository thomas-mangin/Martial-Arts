none of that you keep doing so the

none of that you keep doing so the
 

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:01:02,350
none of that you keep doing so the
entire time that I'm moving it's still

level zero this is up racing okay and

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,030
level zero this is up racing okay and
 

17
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,200
level zero this is up racing okay and
let's call this level one where at every

vector point in the movement I keep
 

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,240
vector point in the movement I keep
vectoring it down into the ground so he

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,250
vectoring it down into the ground so he
 

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,469
vectoring it down into the ground so he
pushes through me to the earth okay so

24
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,479
pushes through me to the earth okay so
 

25
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,469
pushes through me to the earth okay so
when you feel for example now

26
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:47,479

 

27
00:01:47,479 --> 00:02:33,650

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,569

his energy from coming into the one that
 

45
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,979

is energy I want his energy okay so I'm
 

47
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,630
is energy I want his energy okay so I'm
gonna do level zero

comes in history it's going to rebound

comes in history it's going to rebound
 

83
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:32,800
comes in history it's going to rebound
and I don't write it back ok so level 1

84
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:32,810
and I don't write it back ok so level 1
 

85
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,029

maybe his Energy's going through me too

186
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,230
maybe his Energy's going through me too
 

187
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,760
maybe his Energy's going through me too
but I can't brace on him so she's

188
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:01,770
but I can't brace on him so she's
 

189

see that she was taking me that way
she's not pushing it she's got one

196
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,050
she's not pushing it she's got one
 

197
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,160
she's not pushing it she's got one
vector he's got another one okay so I'm

198

vector he's got another one okay so I'm
 

199
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,900
vector he's got another one okay so I'm
here and then you can see that I can

200
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:23,910
here and then you can see that I can
 

201
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:31,130
here and then you can see that I can
still move what you guys did is this

202
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,140
still move what you guys did is this
 

203

still move what you guys did is this
person is not pushing do that and then

204
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,610
person is not pushing do that and then
 

205
00:13:35,610 --> 00:14:06,280
person is not pushing do that and then
you bracing Winky then you go in

206
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,290

 

207
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:19,030

okay and then we had lunch

208

so I'm just y'all so I would think this

214
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
so I'm just y'all so I would think this
 

215
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,449
so I'm just y'all so I would think this
is different this is going to be

216
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:47,459
is different this is going to be
 

217
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,370
is different this is going to be
different where she's not appreciate you

218
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:49,380
different where she's not appreciate you
 

219
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,340
different where she's not appreciate you
detection me but she's really she's

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,350
detection me but she's really she's
 

221
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,040
detection me but she's really she's
really pushing she's really trying to

222
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,050
really pushing she's really trying to
 

223
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,949
really pushing she's really trying to
knock you all right it's a lot of grace

224

225
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,500
knock you all right it's a lot of grace
there but she feels the price so now I

226
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,510
there but she feels the price so now I
 

227
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,920
there but she feels the price so now I
get rid of it and then I would say that

228
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:03,930
get rid of it and then I would say that
 

229
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,079
get rid of it and then I would say that
this you see what I'm waiting here

this you see what I'm waiting here
 

231
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:17,770
this you see what I'm waiting here
that's different so I'm just moving

that I'm obeying those other principles
 

241
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,960
that I'm obeying those other principles
so the first principle is don't push on

so his Energy's going both energies go

326
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:39,920
so his Energy's going both energies go
 

327
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,200
so his Energy's going both energies go
okay and then do the same xpadder
