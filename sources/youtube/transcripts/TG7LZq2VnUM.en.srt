00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,630
all right so what I'm going to do is in
the

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,070
the
end review with my Desi

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
end review with my Desi
 

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,310
end review with my Desi
here

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
here
 

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,510
here
um some of the

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:15,520
um some of the
 

11
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,189
um some of the
basic um energetic alchemical skills

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
basic um energetic alchemical skills
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,429
basic um energetic alchemical skills
that need to be developed we'll see how

14
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
that need to be developed we'll see how
 

15
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,710
that need to be developed we'll see how
far we get today but hopefully we can

16
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
far we get today but hopefully we can
 

17
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,390
far we get today but hopefully we can
get um through releasing and relaxation

18
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:29,400
get um through releasing and relaxation
 

19
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,470
get um through releasing and relaxation
to ground vectrin on the midfoot and

20
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
to ground vectrin on the midfoot and
 

21
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,389
to ground vectrin on the midfoot and
then maybe even to uh Coq projection and

22
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
then maybe even to uh Coq projection and
 

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,549
then maybe even to uh Coq projection and
we'll see okay um but to set up the

24
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:39,559
we'll see okay um but to set up the
 

25
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,029
we'll see okay um but to set up the
context I would like to review of what

26
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:43,039
context I would like to review of what
 

27
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,189
context I would like to review of what
we are doing and why okay uh what we're

28
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:48,199
we are doing and why okay uh what we're
 

29
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:50,950
we are doing and why okay uh what we're
doing uh of course because it's a

30
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
doing uh of course because it's a
 

31
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,310
doing uh of course because it's a
concentric

00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
concentric
 

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,750
concentric
art there are three aspects to it you

34
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
art there are three aspects to it you
 

35
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,110
art there are three aspects to it you
have a physical aspect an energetic

36
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
have a physical aspect an energetic
 

37
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,150
have a physical aspect an energetic

those three things are not causal to

those three things are not causal to
 

41
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,870
those three things are not causal to
each other they are concentric to each

each other they are concentric to each
 

43
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,310
each other they are concentric to each
other so they're not steps you go

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
okay but the end goal is not the

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,030
okay but the end goal is not the
physical not the

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
physical not the
 

59
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,310

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,190
or adhesion no uh the end goal is divine
communion what the Marshall and the

68
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,200
communion what the Marshall and the
 

69
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,149
communion what the Marshall and the
energetic components

70
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
energetic components
 

71
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,190
energetic components
do

72
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200

 

73
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,310

is due to a concentric understanding of

00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,830
is due to a concentric understanding of
the

76
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:58,840
the
 

77
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,789
the
cosmos it is

78
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:01,799
cosmos it is
 

79
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,950
cosmos it is
posited that for example a Divine

80
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:05,960
posited that for example a Divine
 

81
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,669
posited that for example a Divine
communion has an energetic value let's

82
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:08,679
communion has an energetic value let's
 

83
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,830
communion has an energetic value let's
let's say it's a value of x

84
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:12,840
let's say it's a value of x
 

85
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,030
let's say it's a value of x
okay you can

86
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
okay you can
 

87
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,589
okay you can
theoretically learn how to gain the

88
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
theoretically learn how to gain the
 

89
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,790
theoretically learn how to gain the
energetic value of x through the

90
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
energetic value of x through the
 

91
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,110
energetic value of x through the
energetic components of the art and

92
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
energetic components of the art and
 

93
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,470
energetic components of the art and
thereby Prime yourself

94
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
thereby Prime yourself
 

95
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,309
thereby Prime yourself
for experiencing the spiritual component

96
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:33,319
for experiencing the spiritual component
 

97
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,589
for experiencing the spiritual component
of the art okay again my point of view

98
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
of the art okay again my point of view
 

99
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,390
of the art okay again my point of view
is I don't know about that I have no

100
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
is I don't know about that I have no
 

101
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,030
is I don't know about that I have no
that's not my experience that's not the

102
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
that's not my experience that's not the
 

103
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,550
that's not my experience that's not the
experience of anyone I research but I I

104
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:45,560
experience of anyone I research but I I
 

105
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,710
experience of anyone I research but I I
do know that theoretically it's held to

106
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
do know that theoretically it's held to
 

107
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,990
do know that theoretically it's held to
be

108
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
be
 

109
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,670
be
so

110
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
so
 

111
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,670
so
okay um my experience and of the people

112
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:54,680
okay um my experience and of the people
 

113
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,630
okay um my experience and of the people
that I research is they have a Divine

114
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
that I research is they have a Divine
 

115
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,309
that I research is they have a Divine
communion experience

116
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
communion experience
 

117
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,149
communion experience
and from there they end up developing

118
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:03,159
and from there they end up developing
 

119
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,869
and from there they end up developing
the other two components

120
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:05,879
the other two components
 

121
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,830
the other two components
okay what I

122
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
okay what I
 

123
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,070
okay what I
would maybe hold is

124
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
would maybe hold is
 

125
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,550
would maybe hold is
that what the energetic component does

126
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:15,560
that what the energetic component does
 

127
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,869
that what the energetic component does
and this is this is where I'm landing

128
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:17,879
and this is this is where I'm landing
 

129
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,830
and this is this is where I'm landing
right now right um who knows where I'll

130
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:20,840
right now right um who knows where I'll
 

131
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,270
right now right um who knows where I'll
be as my practice develops what I do

132
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
be as my practice develops what I do
 

133
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,789
be as my practice develops what I do
hold is not that the energetic component

134
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
hold is not that the energetic component
 

135
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,670
hold is not that the energetic component
will lead to Divine communion

136
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:30,680
will lead to Divine communion
 

137
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,350
will lead to Divine communion
but that it brings an agency to your

138
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,360
but that it brings an agency to your
 

139
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,429
but that it brings an agency to your
Divine communion meaning you can

140
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:36,439
Divine communion meaning you can
 

141
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,309
Divine communion meaning you can
generate it uh at will and maintain it

142
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
generate it uh at will and maintain it
 

143
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,630
generate it uh at will and maintain it
regardless of your environmental

144
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
regardless of your environmental
 

145
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,070
regardless of your environmental
conditions so I do think that is

146
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,080
conditions so I do think that is
 

147
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,270
conditions so I do think that is
possible okay but the takeaway here is

148
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,280
possible okay but the takeaway here is
 

149
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,190
possible okay but the takeaway here is
the three components of training are

150
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
the three components of training are
 

151
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,830
the three components of training are
concentric to each other then the second

152
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
concentric to each other then the second
 

153
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,710
concentric to each other then the second
takeaway is there is an energetic value

154
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
takeaway is there is an energetic value
 

155
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,470
takeaway is there is an energetic value
to Divine communion Divine communion is

156
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,480
to Divine communion Divine communion is
 

157
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,069
to Divine communion Divine communion is
the goal of the training but we train in

158
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:05,079
the goal of the training but we train in
 

159
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,190
the goal of the training but we train in
these other components the energetic and

160
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,200
these other components the energetic and
 

161
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,030
these other components the energetic and
the

162
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
the
 

163
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,069
the
physical because

164
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,079
physical because
 

165
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,229
physical because
concentrically we are achieving for

166
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
concentrically we are achieving for
 

167
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,870
concentrically we are achieving for
example that energetic value of divine

168
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:17,880
example that energetic value of divine
 

169
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,749
example that energetic value of divine
communion and in the end I would

170
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:20,759
communion and in the end I would

know that because you can't do what I

284
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,120
know that because you can't do what I
 

285
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,230
know that because you can't do what I
can do if you if you had the

286
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,240
can do if you if you had the
 

287
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,710
can do if you if you had the
understanding you'd have the experience

288
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
understanding you'd have the experience
 

289
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,189

and if you had the experience you could
 

291
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,710
and if you had the experience you could
do what I could do

do what I could do
 

293
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,550
do what I could do
okay so the way the technology of self

294
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
okay so the way the technology of self
 

295
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,749
okay so the way the technology of self
works is communion with God is

296
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:22,759
works is communion with God is
 

297
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,550
works is communion with God is
equivalent to a release of self or in

equivalent to a release of self or in
 

299
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,430
equivalent to a release of self or in
our discourse a sensation of the ego

300
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
our discourse a sensation of the ego
 

301
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,869
our discourse a sensation of the ego
tripartite mind

302
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:31,879
tripartite mind
 

303
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,270
tripartite mind
okay uh and that stands in contrast to

304
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
okay uh and that stands in contrast to
 

305
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,629
okay uh and that stands in contrast to
self attachment or

306
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:37,639
self attachment or
 

307
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,550
self attachment or
egocentricity if we're looking here on

egocentricity if we're looking here on
 

309
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,029
egocentricity if we're looking here on
the right or an unconscious domination

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
likewise there can't be released with
 

821
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,549
likewise there can't be released with
muscle tension there can't be the

822
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:27,559
muscle tension there can't be the
 

823
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,270
muscle tension there can't be the
spiritual

824
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
spiritual
 

825
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,909
spiritual
uh skill of releasing what is

826
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
uh skill of releasing what is
 

827
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,190
uh skill of releasing what is
releasing uh detaching from self okay

828
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
releasing uh detaching from self okay
 

829
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,590
releasing uh detaching from self okay
there cannot be the spiritual skill of

830
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
there cannot be the spiritual skill of
 

831
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,549
there cannot be the spiritual skill of
releasing with muscle tension so hence

832
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
releasing with muscle tension so hence
 

833
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,909
releasing with muscle tension so hence
we start with muscle relaxing drills

834
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:44,919
we start with muscle relaxing drills
 

835

shoulder width okay uh the physical
 

909
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,430
shoulder width okay uh the physical
parameters are if he goes really

910
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,440
parameters are if he goes really
 

911
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,950
parameters are if he goes really
wide I don't want the structure of his

912

wide I don't want the structure of his
 

913

wide I don't want the structure of his
weight concaving his

914
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:48,600

 

915
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,470

arch or requiring him to flex to keep

916
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
arch or requiring him to flex to keep
 

917
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,630
arch or requiring him to flex to keep
his arch from concaving okay so if his

918
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:55,640
his arch from concaving okay so if his
 

919
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,390
his arch from concaving okay so if his
feet are really wide he has has to have

920
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
feet are really wide he has has to have
 

921
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,950
feet are really wide he has has to have
flexion like in a horse dance to get

922
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
flexion like in a horse dance to get
 

923
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,029
flexion like in a horse dance to get
that to work and we don't want flexion

924
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
that to work and we don't want flexion
 

925
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,269
that to work and we don't want flexion
right now okay and if he's really

926
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:06,279
right now okay and if he's really
 

927
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,710
right now okay and if he's really
narrow right it's the same thing his

928
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:09,720
narrow right it's the same thing his
 

929
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,950
narrow right it's the same thing his
feet are there's pressure on the outside

930
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:11,960
feet are there's pressure on the outside
 

931
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,909

falling what you think is going to be
 

1143
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,470
falling what you think is going to be
falling from the rebounding Chi hitting

1144
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
falling from the rebounding Chi hitting
 

1145
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,350
falling from the rebounding Chi hitting
the ground

1146
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:00,360
the ground
 

1147
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,750
the ground
okay that and that's the hard part

1148
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:02,760
okay that and that's the hard part
 

1149
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,630
okay that and that's the hard part
because the fear of falling makes you

1150
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
because the fear of falling makes you
 

1151
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,149
because the fear of falling makes you
Flex you you get it and so this is why

1152
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
Flex you you get it and so this is why
 

1153
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,909
Flex you you get it and so this is why
this is a limal practice in this limal

1154
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:10,919
this is a limal practice in this limal
 

1155
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,110
this is a limal practice in this limal
practice alone you have to release the

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,120
practice alone you have to release the
 

1157
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,230

fear if you don't release the fear the
 

1159
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,389
fear if you don't release the fear the
energy will not bounce back off the

1160
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:19,399
energy will not bounce back off the
 

1161
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,070
energy will not bounce back off the
ground and you will actually fall

1162
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
ground and you will actually fall
 

1163
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,310
ground and you will actually fall
forward okay you will fall

1164
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320

 

1165
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,990

forward

1166
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,000
forward
 

1167
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,950
forward
okay all right and so let's try that Dr

1168
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:31,960
okay all right and so let's try that Dr
 

1169
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,509
okay all right and so let's try that Dr
and it's tiring it is tiring at first um

1170
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:35,519
and it's tiring it is tiring at first um
 

1171
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,990
and it's tiring it is tiring at first um
but this is something you can

1172
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
but this is something you can
 

1173
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,870
but this is something you can
extend uh two

1174
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
extend uh two
 

1175
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,149
extend uh two
minutes you know you you have people

1176
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:43,159
minutes you know you you have people
 

1177
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,149
minutes you know you you have people
that will do this thing for two hours 20

1178
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
that will do this thing for two hours 20
 

1179
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,509
that will do this thing for two hours 20
minutes Etc again once you know how to

1200
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
said like two minutes two minutes is
 

1201
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,630
said like two minutes two minutes is
pretty good 20 minutes is long um but

1202
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
pretty good 20 minutes is long um but
 

1203
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,029
pretty good 20 minutes is long um but
you might need that because just like

1204
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
you might need that because just like
 

1205
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,310
you might need that because just like
everything else you you might not feel

1206
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,320
everything else you you might not feel
 

1207
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,230
everything else you you might not feel
your tension until you go longer into

1208
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
your tension until you go longer into
 

1209
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,350
your tension until you go longer into
the practice where the tension can't be

1210
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,360
the practice where the tension can't be
 

1211
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,310
the practice where the tension can't be
upheld any longer okay but I think when

1212
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,320
upheld any longer okay but I think when
 

1213
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,870
upheld any longer okay but I think when
you're doing 2 hours I think that's a

1214
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:35,880
you're doing 2 hours I think that's a
 

1215
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,710
you're doing 2 hours I think that's a
little bit overkill for me but again you

1216
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
little bit overkill for me but again you
 

1217
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,269
little bit overkill for me but again you
might need that okay all right so let's

1218
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
might need that okay all right so let's
 

1219
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,470
might need that okay all right so let's
try this

1220
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:43,480
try this
 

1221
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,110
try this

advantage of that uh every day I do
those releasing from there but every

1280
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:14,639
those releasing from there but every
 

1281
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,110
those releasing from there but every
time you add or you work with one of the

so when you add that fear of falling

1286
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:23,880
so when you add that fear of falling
 

1287
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,950
so when you add that fear of falling
you're going to generate more release

1288
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:25,960
you're going to generate more release
 

1289
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,750

this

1542
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:22,920
this
 

1543
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,550
this
inertia and not have it be a slave to

the straight angle
 

1547
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,829
the straight angle
okay to help get you in the ballpark all

1548
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:30,839
okay to help get you in the ballpark all
 

1549
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,910
okay to help get you in the ballpark all
right okay let's try

1550
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:33,920
right okay let's try
 

1551
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,550
right okay let's try
it okay so as I said pre-enlightenment

1552
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:39,560
it okay so as I said pre-enlightenment
 

1553
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,109
it okay so as I said pre-enlightenment
religion uh always had checks and

1554
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:42,119
religion uh always had checks and
 

1555
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,630
religion uh always had checks and
balances built in because they didn't

1556
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,640
balances built in because they didn't
 

1557
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,790
balances built in because they didn't
function purely at the ideational level

1558
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
function purely at the ideational level
 

1559
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,829
function purely at the ideational level
uh so there were always body practices

1560
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:50,839
uh so there were always body practices
 

1561
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,750
uh so there were always body practices
physical practices and they were always

1562
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
physical practices and they were always
 

1563
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,270
physical practices and they were always
held to be more insightful in terms of

1564
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
held to be more insightful in terms of
 

1565
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,470
held to be more insightful in terms of
your spiritual practice or lack thereof

1566
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,480
your spiritual practice or lack thereof
 

1567
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,670
your spiritual practice or lack thereof
so the cool thing about budo is it's not

1568
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
so the cool thing about budo is it's not
 

1569
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,430
so the cool thing about budo is it's not
ideational except for those who are

1570
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,440
ideational except for those who are
 

1571
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,430
ideational except for those who are
doing it incorrectly it has a practice

1572
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:08,440
doing it incorrectly it has a practice
 

1573
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,069
doing it incorrectly it has a practice
component it has a body component and so

1574
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:11,079
component it has a body component and so
 

1575
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,270
component it has a body component and so
we can test for validity there okay um

1576
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
we can test for validity there okay um
 

1577
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,470
we can test for validity there okay um
so you can do for example you can do

1578
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
so you can do for example you can do
 

1579
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,670
so you can do for example you can do
let's say you're a

1580
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
let's say you're a
 

1581
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,589
let's say you're a
neon practitioner and you can do this

1582
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:22,599
neon practitioner and you can do this
 

1583
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,990
neon practitioner and you can do this
standing standing meditation and then

1584
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,000
standing standing meditation and then
 

1585
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,990
standing standing meditation and then
you can start telling yourself that

1586
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,000
you can start telling yourself that
 

1587
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,790
you can start telling yourself that
you're doing it that's that's very

1588
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:28,800
you're doing it that's that's very
 

1589
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,150
you're doing it that's that's very
problematic to me okay and so we do do

1590
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
problematic to me okay and so we do do
 

1591
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,390
problematic to me okay and so we do do
solo training but here we don't

1592
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
solo training but here we don't
 

1593
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,470
solo training but here we don't
emphasize solo training precisely

1594
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
emphasize solo training precisely
 

1595
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,670
emphasize solo training precisely
because can I tell do I know okay so we

1596
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
because can I tell do I know okay so we
 

1597
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,109
because can I tell do I know okay so we
start putting a partner training so we

1598
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:44,119
start putting a partner training so we
 

1599
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,470
start putting a partner training so we
value more partner training than solo

1600
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
value more partner training than solo
 

1601
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,990
value more partner training than solo
training and when it comes to partner

1602
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,000
training and when it comes to partner
 

1603
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,470
training and when it comes to partner
training we value more the live training

1604
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,480
training we value more the live training
 

1605
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,309
training we value more the live training
environments than we do the controlled

1606
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:54,319
environments than we do the controlled
 

1607
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,309
environments than we do the controlled
environments okay so we wish went from a

1608
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:57,319
environments okay so we wish went from a
 

1609
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,069
environments okay so we wish went from a
solo practice which I do recommend you

1610
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:00,079
solo practice which I do recommend you
 

1611
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,670
solo practice which I do recommend you
should do uh and you should start there

1612
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
should do uh and you should start there
 

1613
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,150
should do uh and you should start there
but um if you can't do what we're doing

1614
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,160
but um if you can't do what we're doing
 

1615
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,870
but um if you can't do what we're doing
now in the paired practice you probably

1616
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:09,880
now in the paired practice you probably
 

1617
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,990
now in the paired practice you probably
weren't doing it I'm going to say you

1618
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
weren't doing it I'm going to say you
 

1619
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,589
weren't doing it I'm going to say you
weren't doing it you weren't doing it in

1620
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
weren't doing it you weren't doing it in
 

1621
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,829
weren't doing it you weren't doing it in

muscle tension that I
 

1705
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,510
muscle tension that I
can without giving up the shape so

1706
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
can without giving up the shape so
 

1707
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,109
can without giving up the shape so
everything is if you go ahead and you

1725
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,270

all right so let's add that to the drill

1726
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,280

 

1727
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,790

go okay so what what if you remember

go okay so what what if you remember
 

1729
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,270
go okay so what what if you remember
when you're doing this eventually you'll

1730
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:16,280
when you're doing this eventually you'll
 

1731
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,510

the yangong chi which now converts to
 

1737
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,670
the yangong chi which now converts to
Yin chees it hits the Earth it comes

1738
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
Yin chees it hits the Earth it comes
 

1739
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,870
Yin chees it hits the Earth it comes
back up up okay now that's Yin your

1740
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
back up up okay now that's Yin your
 

1741
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,230
back up up okay now that's Yin your
tanden is actually formed but you're not

1742
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:31,240
tanden is actually formed but you're not
 

1743
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,630
tanden is actually formed but you're not
aware of it and so we're not asking you

1744
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:33,640
aware of it and so we're not asking you
 

1745
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,430
aware of it and so we're not asking you
to be aware of it at this point okay but

1746
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:37,440
to be aware of it at this point okay but
 

1747
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,710
to be aware of it at this point okay but
when I go here as he's pushing what's

1748
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
when I go here as he's pushing what's
 

1749
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,630
when I go here as he's pushing what's
actually pushing back on him is that

1750
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:43,640
actually pushing back on him is that
 

1751
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,549
actually pushing back on him is that
same yongi coming off the floor that's

1752
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:46,559
same yongi coming off the floor that's
 

1753
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,270
same yongi coming off the floor that's
why it's more that it's coming

1754
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:50,280
why it's more that it's coming
 

1755
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,190
why it's more that it's coming
out of me do you see not him coming into

1756
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
out of me do you see not him coming into
 

1757
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,990
out of me do you see not him coming into
me okay and the more relaxed I am the

1758
00:44:58,990 --> 00:44:59,000
me okay and the more relaxed I am the
 

1759
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,549
me okay and the more relaxed I am the
more that comes the more he comes in and

1760
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:01,559
more that comes the more he comes in and
 

1761
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:04,470
more that comes the more he comes in and
the more that comes out okay so what I

1762
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
the more that comes out okay so what I
 

1763
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,910
the more that comes out okay so what I
want to do now is my weight's on the

1764
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:06,920
want to do now is my weight's on the
 

1765
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,910
want to do now is my weight's on the
back foot what I want to do now is merge

1766
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
back foot what I want to do now is merge
 

1767
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,589
back foot what I want to do now is merge
with that coming

1768
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
with that coming
 

1769
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,349
with that coming
out shift my

1770
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:18,359

 

1771
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,630

weight so I'll let it load boom and then

1772
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:23,640
weight so I'll let it load boom and then
 

1773
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,349
weight so I'll let it load boom and then
shift my weight boom

1774
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:28,359

 

1775
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,510

and at this on this drill it's probably

1776
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
and at this on this drill it's probably
 

1777
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,990
and at this on this drill it's probably
going to go somewhere around the

1778
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,000
going to go somewhere around the
 

1779
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,030
going to go somewhere around the
