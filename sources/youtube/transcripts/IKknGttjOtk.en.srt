here again we'll just start static but

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
here again we'll just start static but
 

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,350

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,190
it's
50/50 so posst as I circle around create

62
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
50/50 so posst as I circle around create
 

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,949
50/50 so posst as I circle around create
distance and come in for this bicep
