uh

24
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
uh
 

25
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,349
uh
psychosis he said you'll be asked to

26
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
psychosis he said you'll be asked to

so there's

32
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
so there's
 

33
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,549

39
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,630

then

40
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
then
 

41
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,430
then
yeah

42
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
yeah
 

43
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,270
yeah
okay my turn

47
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,790
that that's completely wrong attitude
but sometimes

48
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
but sometimes
 

49
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,510
but sometimes
we have to overcome that now i had that

50
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
we have to overcome that now i had that
 

51
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,590

00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
bad attitude
 

53
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,349
bad attitude
and um

54
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
and um
 

55
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,950

56
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
i don't know how many years it took me
 

57
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,830
i don't know how many years it took me
to

58
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840

than me me
so

70
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
so
 

71
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,270
so
um

72
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
um
 

73
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,350
um
so if they can't move

74
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360

 

75
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,910
