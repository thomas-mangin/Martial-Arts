1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,150
Sensei, thank you for today.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,250
I saw these for the first time. Are these original scrolls of Daito-ryu?

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:17,723
Yes, these are scrolls issued by Takeda Sokaku sensei. The Hiden Mokuroku 118 techniques.

4
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,747
Let’s have a look.

5
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:22,067
Yes, please.

6
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,067
Please explain.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,099
I’m going to explain about these scrolls.

8
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:42,484
The upper one was issued by Takeda Sokaku sensei. It is “Daito-ryu Jujutsu Hiden Mokuroku”.

9
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,720
There is a stamp here. 

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,410
It says, Takeda Sokaku Hombu-cho.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,390
Specifically, Daito-ryu Jujutsu Hombu-cho Minamoto no Masayoshi is written.

12
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:09,598
The stamp below is “Take-So”. It means Takeda Soke (head of a school).

13
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:18,745
The scroll below was issued by Ueshiba Morihei sensei.

14
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:25,220
It’s title is “Aikijujutsu Hiden Mokuroku”.

15
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:34,642
Its technical content is the same as that of Daito-ryu Jujutsu Hiden Mokuroku.

16
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:37,506
I would like to explain while comparing them.

17
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,880
Please.

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,800
In the case of Ueshiba sensei’s scroll, the word “Aiki” is included in the title.

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,840
Takeda sensei’s one says Daito-ryu Jujutsu.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,945
And similarly, the first technique reads as “attack with your right hand”

21
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:10,901
This is the same too. I think this technique is Ikkyo.
 

22
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,420
Shomen-uchi Ikkyo?

23
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,636
Yes, that’s right.
 

24
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:15,554
It starts from that technique.
 

25
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:26,460
As we look, these are Zatori jujutstu techniques.

26
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,164
What is Zatori?

27
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,299
It means that the techniques are executed from a sitting.

28
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:42,850
These techniques are followed by Hanza handachi Jujutsu techniques.

29
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,850
In Aikido, these are?

30
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:46,297
Hanmi Handachi.

31
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:53,239
It’s the same thing. In Daito-ryu we say Hanza Handachi.

32
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,000
As we compare the two scrolls, their contents are the same.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Where the papers are connected, the ”Take-So” stamp is always put.

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:19,877
As we look, these are standing techniques. Tachi-dori Jujutsu is written.

35
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:26,722
It is followed by “Nininzume no Koto”. It is Ninin-dori or techniques against two opponents.

36
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,935
Two opponents from both sides?

37
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:39,861
Yes, two opponents grab the hands from both sides. These techniques apply in this situation.

38
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:45,150
And this is “Kasadori” or umbrella taking. In Ueshiba sensei’s scroll, the same thing is written.

39
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,210
These are followed by techniques against a situation when the opponent grabs the grip of the sword.

40
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:08,281
When the samurai was wearing a sword at his waist, the opponent grabs the grip of the sword to prevent the samurai to draw it.

41
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:13,365
There is a technique for this situation.

42
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:18,954
And altogether, 118 techniques are listed.

43
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:24,150
Including 30 Soto-te variations.

44
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:38,855
The next part, here, says Daito-ryu jujutsu while Ueshiba sensei’s scroll writes Aiki Jujutsu.

45
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:43,180
If you look at the content of this part, it writes enthusiastic (熱心 nesshin) in both cases.

46
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:56,255
. I understand, but it's been bought hot, isn't

47
00:04:56,377 --> 00:05:09,310
“Nesshin asakarazu” has the meaning that the practitioner has to be attracted and practice thoroughly.

48
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:19,760
After that, “keiko wo ketainaku” comes meaning without neglecting training.

49
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:31,125
It follows as “shori no hataraki” or ability of victory.

50
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:45,359
“Now, I award you this scroll” it says.

51
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:49,373
Gishin sezu: without dout

52
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:56,400
Sessa takuma no ue: through friendly rivalry

53
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,084
Hissho no jutsu: the techniques of sure victory

54
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:03,984
Kanawa narubeku soro: will come true

55
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:05,473
Kudan no gotosi: as it is written.

56
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:11,289
This is how we read it.

57
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:17,030
The final part of the scroll is the genealogy.

58
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,078
It begins with Emperor Seiwa.

59
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,984
Then, Sadasumi Shin-o

60
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:30,603
Ueshiba sensei’s scroll also mentions Emperor seiwa and Sadasumi Shin-o.

61
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:38,626
However, in the case of Ueshiba sensei’s scroll it is followed by Takeda Sokaku sensei and Ueshiba Morihei sensei.

62
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:45,579
Here, he is written as Ueshiba Moritaka Minamoto no Seigan.

63
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:54,255
The Daito-ryu scroll follows. 

64
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:58,000
We can see, Shinra Saburo Minamoto no Yoshimitsu.

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,620
And then, it’s past down in the Takeda family.

66
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:19,999
We can see here Takeda Kunitsugu, who moved to Aizu. Then it connects to Takeda Sokaku sensei.

67
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:29,964
His title is Daito-ryu Jujutsu Hombu-cho and his full name is Takeda Sokaku Minamoto no Masayoshi.

68
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:36,760
What is interesting is that it’s issued in the September of 1936.

69
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:52,455
This time is exactly when Hisa Takuma sensei started to learn from Takeda sensei at the Asahi Newspaper.

70
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:56,900
At the same time as Hisa sensei learned at Asahi

71
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:09,702
This scroll was given to Kusumoto Koichiro sensei. He was learning from Takeda sensei in Hyogo prefecture, simultaneously.

72
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:18,880
So Takeda sensei was teaching at both places while taking turns.

73
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,940
I assume it was Kobe where Takeda sensei taught Mr. Kusumoto.

74
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,631
We can find Kusumoto san’s name in the eimeiroku as well.

75
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:35,060
He was the vice-captain of Meiji University’s sumo club.

76
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,169
Hisa sensei was also experienced in Sumo.

77
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,930
Kusumoto sensei too.

78
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,529
He was 4 dan in Judo.

79
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:59,424
For him, three scrolls were presented from Takeda Sokaku sensei.

80
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:07,939
Sensei, the title of Takeda sensei looks different. What’s written here?

81
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:14,420
It writes 34 generations Aizu warrior.

82
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:29,971
So it compiles the Takeda family’s lineage in one sentence.

83
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:40,172
And Ueshiba sensei is written as “monjin” of Takeda sensei.

84
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:48,578


85
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:54,913
I might see the first time, Ueshiba sensei using such a name.

86
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,123
What’s the meaning of Minamoto no Seigan?

87
00:09:57,123 --> 00:10:03,521
Perhaps, it’s because Takeda sensei used the Minamoto name.

88
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:12,935
I think, similarly, Ueshiba sensei called himself Minamoto followed by Seigan.

89
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,211
Sensei, are these different scrolls?

90
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:20,333
Yes, these are different.

91
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:26,650
This one is Hiden Okugi no Koto.

92
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:33,094
It was given from Takeda Sokaku sensei to Kusumoto Koichiro sense, who I already explained earlier.

93
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:40,529
This is the second scroll of Daito-ryu with 36 techniques.

94
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,124
The techniques are listed.

95
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:50,244
As we saw earlier, where the pages are connected the “Take-So” stamp is put.

96
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:52,560
All together 36 techniques.

97
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:05,574
It says that these techniques on the right are Goshinyo no Te.

98
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:12,339
It is followed by the same text and lineage.

99
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,920
and it’s dated 1936.

100
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,127
This is the second scroll.

101
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:26,735
The one below is the third scroll of Daito-ryu.

102
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:33,373
I think it will be released to the world, but Daito-ryu Aiki

103
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:41,272
“Daito-ryu Aikijujutus Hiokugi no Koto”

104
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:51,101
Some people read it as “Ogi”, however, it’s read as “Okugi”.

105
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:57,420
The stamps are very interesting.

106
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,449
From the third scroll, “Daito-ryu Aiki no Jujutsu” is used. It includes “no”.

107
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:19,926
Then, Somucho Takeda Sokaku Minamoto no Masayoshi is written.

108
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:27,950
This stamp is the characteristic of the third scroll. A different stamp is put on it.

109
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,469
There is another characteristic.

110
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:42,000
The third scroll mentions the name of a technique “Shiho-nage” for the first time.

111
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,876
The techniques seem to be explained in detail.

112
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:46,876
That’s right.

113
00:12:47,379 --> 00:13:05,488
As far as I know, the third scroll was compiled around this time (1936).

114
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:16,433
Till that time, only Hiden Mokuroku 118 techniques and this Hiden Okugi no Koto 36 techniques existed.

115
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:27,089
And later, this Hiokugi scroll was made, I think.

116
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:40,390
And here, the list goes 118 techniques, Aiki no Jutsu, and Hiden Okugi.

117
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:46,000
All together 84 techniques.

118
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:57,027
Jo-chu-ge. All these are colled Goshinyo no Te.

119
00:13:57,027 --> 00:14:01,570
Sensei, What’s the meaning of ura-omote and jo-chu-ge?

120
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:19,377
There are Omote and Ura forms.

121
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:27,340
I don’t think that jo-chu-ge simply means upper, middle, and lower.

122
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,884
Regarding this part, further research is necessary.

123
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:42,338
This third scroll was given to Kusumoto Koichiro sensei.

124
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:49,134
Usually, at the end of 84 techniques, there is an explanation about Aiki Nito-ken (Aiki two swords)

125
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:53,364
However, this scroll doesn’t include that part.

126
00:14:54,196 --> 00:15:00,866
During this period, Hisa sensei learned from Takeda sensei in the Kansai area.

127
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:13,821
We can assume that this scroll is almost identical to the one given to Hisa sensei.

128
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:22,208
I heard that Hisa sensei’s scroll was destroyed during the war, but probably it didn’t include Aiki Nito ken ether.

129
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:28,880
Takeda sensei probably didn’t teach these techniques at this time.

130
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:32,488
Is it Ok?

131
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:33,128
Thank you very much.

132
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,909
Thank you.
