1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,270

we're going to do the first kumitachi

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
we're going to do the first kumitachi
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,950
we're going to do the first kumitachi
so we're going to do the cream attaches

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:04,960
so we're going to do the cream attaches
 

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,110
so we're going to do the cream attaches
and the variations if we do the first

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
and the variations if we do the first
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,230
and the variations if we do the first
kim attack for you as soon as i know

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
kim attack for you as soon as i know
 

9
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,270
kim attack for you as soon as i know
he's about to move i sense that

10
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
he's about to move i sense that
 

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,070
he's about to move i sense that
so

12
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
so
 

13
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,710
so
this is mental

14
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
this is mental
 

15
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,429
this is mental
you'll be watching the technical

16
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
you'll be watching the technical
 

17
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,310
you'll be watching the technical
because you can't feel

18
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
because you can't feel
 

19
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
because you can't feel
the mental

20
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
the mental
 

21
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,109
the mental
so when he when i left here this is this

22
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119

 

23
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,870

he's ken

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
he's ken
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,870
he's ken
the energy from his pen to me i fell i

26
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
the energy from his pen to me i fell i
 

27
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,549
the energy from his pen to me i fell i
sensed

28
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
sensed
 

29
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,350
sensed
so the higher the grade

30
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
so the higher the grade
 

31
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,830
so the higher the grade
i want you to start looking at not the

32
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:43,840
i want you to start looking at not the
 

33
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,069
i want you to start looking at not the
but the feeling that you should be

34
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
but the feeling that you should be
 

35
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,510
but the feeling that you should be
getting from it if i if i move my cane

36
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
getting from it if i if i move my cane
 

37
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,229
getting from it if i if i move my cane
up and down like this slowly but i'm

38
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
up and down like this slowly but i'm
 

39
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,990
up and down like this slowly but i'm
projecting my

40
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
projecting my
 

41
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,790
projecting my
my

42
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
my
 

43
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,750
my
energy i'm projecting my coat view if i

44
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
energy i'm projecting my coat view if i
 

45
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,389
energy i'm projecting my coat view if i
do this nigel should feel that going up

46
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
do this nigel should feel that going up
 

47
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,310
do this nigel should feel that going up
and down his west bone

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
and down his west bone
 

49
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,030
and down his west bone
and you might go class a bit sensitive

50
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
and you might go class a bit sensitive
 

51
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,429
and you might go class a bit sensitive
but that's really

52
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
but that's really
 

53
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,830
but that's really
oh sensei's said they're already

54
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
oh sensei's said they're already
 

55
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,630
oh sensei's said they're already
defeated before they attacked me

56
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
defeated before they attacked me
 

57
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,270
defeated before they attacked me
it's because he sensed it he almost knew

58
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
it's because he sensed it he almost knew
 

59
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,350
it's because he sensed it he almost knew
the person better than they may have

60
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
the person better than they may have
 

61
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,749
the person better than they may have
known themselves

62
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
known themselves
 

63
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:29,109
known themselves
so so the technical

64
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119

 

65
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,990

when that turns it's almost like inside

66
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
when that turns it's almost like inside
 

67
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,190
when that turns it's almost like inside
me turn it i feel that stir

68
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
me turn it i feel that stir
 

69
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,590
me turn it i feel that stir
i sense it i feel that stir

70
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600

 

71
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,030

that makes this happen

72
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040

 

73
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,429

and then i feel it again i feel that

74
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439

 

75
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,670

that operates me

76
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
that operates me
 

77
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,429
that operates me
that operates me to do this

78
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439

 

79
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,270

so i don't really need to look at him

80
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
so i don't really need to look at him
 

81
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,429
so i don't really need to look at him
because in the end i'm sort of wired to

82
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
because in the end i'm sort of wired to
 

83
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,990
because in the end i'm sort of wired to
them

84
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000

 

85
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,029

so depending on your level

86
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
so depending on your level
 

87
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,110
so depending on your level
you'll be either doing technical

88
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120

 

89
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,990

ah

90
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000

 

91
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,670

and that's as far as it'll go it'll just

92
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
and that's as far as it'll go it'll just
 

93
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,830
and that's as far as it'll go it'll just
be boom boom boom nice and clean and

94
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
be boom boom boom nice and clean and
 

95
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,750
be boom boom boom nice and clean and
technical or

96
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
technical or
 

97
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,830
technical or
it'll be what i consider spiritual but

98
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
it'll be what i consider spiritual but
 

99
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,150
it'll be what i consider spiritual but
it's mental

100
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
it's mental
 

101
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,990
it's mental
really

102
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000

 

103
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,630

you may not see a difference but me and

104
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
you may not see a difference but me and
 

105
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,710
you may not see a difference but me and
nigel know that there's a different

106
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
nigel know that there's a different
 

107
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,949
nigel know that there's a different
atmosphere between us

108
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
atmosphere between us
 

109
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,470
atmosphere between us
and that's about the only words i can

110
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
and that's about the only words i can
 

111
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,229
and that's about the only words i can
use right so we're going to look at the

112
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
use right so we're going to look at the
 

113
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,550
use right so we're going to look at the
first two hitachi those who don't know

114
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
first two hitachi those who don't know
 

115
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,110
first two hitachi those who don't know
it

116
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120

 

117
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,390

okay

118
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
okay
 

119
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,830
okay
so

120
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
so
 

121
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,070
so
i didn't see anybody doing what i call

122
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
i didn't see anybody doing what i call
 

123
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,430
i didn't see anybody doing what i call
the mental side or the spiritual side i

124
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
the mental side or the spiritual side i
 

125
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,350
the mental side or the spiritual side i

141
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,390

hey

142
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400

 

143
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,990

now

144
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
now
 

145
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,830
now
the next stage of the mental part is

146
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
the next stage of the mental part is
 

147
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,949
the next stage of the mental part is
i was the same fairly even if i growled

148
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
i was the same fairly even if i growled
 

149
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,670
i was the same fairly even if i growled
and grunted and shouted

150
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
and grunted and shouted
 

151
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,070
and grunted and shouted
my own persona wasn't bothered and i

152
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
my own persona wasn't bothered and i

wasn't trying to win on either one
 

155
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,110
wasn't trying to win on either one
so this is the mental thing now i'm just

156
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
so this is the mental thing now i'm just
 

157
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,149
so this is the mental thing now i'm just
going to talk about that so here

158
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
going to talk about that so here
 

159

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,589
that's how it says actually though
might be you know it's got no senses

168
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599

 

169
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,270

it should have nothing

170
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
it should have nothing
 

171
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,670

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
i enjoyed that little bit didn't i and
 

527
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,269
i enjoyed that little bit didn't i and
that was wrong

528
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
that was wrong
 

529
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,310
that was wrong
so

530
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
so
 

531
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,949
so
so you're never gonna be right

532
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
so you're never gonna be right
 

533
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,470
so you're never gonna be right
and that's why

534
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
and that's why
 

535
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,710
and that's why
as i say nearly 50 years of training

536
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
as i say nearly 50 years of training
 

537
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,949
as i say nearly 50 years of training
that's why i'm still doing it because i

538
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
that's why i'm still doing it because i
 

539
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,110
that's why i'm still doing it because i
haven't mastered it yet

540
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
haven't mastered it yet
 

541
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,350
haven't mastered it yet
or who am i trying to master but i'm

542
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
or who am i trying to master but i'm
 

543
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,670
or who am i trying to master but i'm
enjoying the ride on the way

544
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
enjoying the ride on the way
 

545
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,279
enjoying the ride on the way
and that's that's the wonderful thing
