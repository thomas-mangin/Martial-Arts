1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,030

yeah you have to you have to observe

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:02,040
yeah you have to you have to observe
 

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,490
yeah you have to you have to observe
better so we're going to start going

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:04,500
better so we're going to start going
 

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,309
better so we're going to start going
from a kihon to more of an application

6
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:07,319
from a kihon to more of an application
 

7
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,270
from a kihon to more of an application
Okay so

8
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,280
Okay so
 

9
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,730
Okay so
right and we have shihon nage

10
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:13,740
right and we have shihon nage
 

11
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:26,450
right and we have shihon nage
coming out

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:26,460

 

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,310

we're gonna take the

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
we're gonna take the
 

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,330
we're gonna take the
Escape okay so this one

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:32,340
Escape okay so this one
 

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,590
Escape okay so this one
out here then step into the two on one

18
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600

 

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:51,830

clear the line

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840

 

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,090

he's going that way

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,100

One Way angle deviation the other way

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,969

okay let's go

32
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:10,979
okay let's go
 

33
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,330
okay let's go
okay so you you need that uh Yin space

34
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:14,340
okay so you you need that uh Yin space
 

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,690
okay so you you need that uh Yin space
right it could be it pulls that's going

36
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,700
right it could be it pulls that's going
 

37
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,190
right it could be it pulls that's going
to begin energy

38
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
to begin energy
 

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,990
to begin energy
okay

40
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
okay
 

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,070
okay
um so he pulls in you have uh cook your

42
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,080
um so he pulls in you have uh cook your
 

43
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,890
um so he pulls in you have uh cook your
hole see

44
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:27,900

 

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,830

but we're gonna do it from the arm who's

46
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:30,840
but we're gonna do it from the arm who's
 

47
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,890
but we're gonna do it from the arm who's
pulling and we'll come in and we'll use

48
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
pulling and we'll come in and we'll use
 

49
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,069
pulling and we'll come in and we'll use
the arm to do the top topsy-turvy effect

50
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079
the arm to do the top topsy-turvy effect
 

51
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,490
the arm to do the top topsy-turvy effect
so this

52
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:40,500

 

53
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,850

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,140
conceptually if you can't enter that far
 

57
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,890
conceptually if you can't enter that far
you can just pick up the leg pick up the

58
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:48,900
you can just pick up the leg pick up the
 

59
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,590
you can just pick up the leg pick up the
leg with the knee

60
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
leg with the knee
 

61
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,230
leg with the knee
sweep the leg this way

62
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
sweep the leg this way
 

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,910
sweep the leg this way
but keep this aren't going

64
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920

 

65
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,429

and look for the end

66
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
and look for the end
 

67
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,490
and look for the end
so as he's going maybe it's a wall maybe

68
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,500
so as he's going maybe it's a wall maybe
 

69
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,969
so as he's going maybe it's a wall maybe
he stopped he stopped okay and that's

70
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:07,979
he stopped he stopped okay and that's
 

71
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,949
he stopped he stopped okay and that's
gonna be but look at his base that's

72
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:09,959
gonna be but look at his base that's
 

73
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,690
gonna be but look at his base that's
gonna be where I use it okay

74
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:14,700

 

75
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,930

the other way you can generate a yet

76
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:17,940
the other way you can generate a yet
 

77
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,150
the other way you can generate a yet
movement is let's say he's going young

78
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
movement is let's say he's going young
 

79
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,210
movement is let's say he's going young
you see

80
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,220

 

81
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,190

so I'm just gonna move out of the way he

82
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
so I'm just gonna move out of the way he
 

83
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,949
so I'm just gonna move out of the way he
goes young and I shaved

84
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:27,959
goes young and I shaved
 

85
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,150
goes young and I shaved
okay so I'm here maybe he pulls right

86
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
okay so I'm here maybe he pulls right
 

87
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,309
okay so I'm here maybe he pulls right
now he's going young and I shake

00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:37,319

 

89
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,330

so

90
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,340
so
 

91
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,910
so
we'll be here in the camera okay

92
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
we'll be here in the camera okay
 

93
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,170
we'll be here in the camera okay
stay here

94
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,180

00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:49,019
as he starts to push on me I shave this
 

101

so imagine our bodies here he goes to
 

105
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,449
so imagine our bodies here he goes to
push and move out a little bit

106
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:56,459
push and move out a little bit
 

107
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,630
push and move out a little bit
I like all the arm as he pushes and I

108

brace and then I'll try to go okay
 

123
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,369

so I'm stuck to him he goes to pull and

124
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:40,379
so I'm stuck to him he goes to pull and
 

125

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,430
so you go clockwise
and we usually go inside this circle

178
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
and we usually go inside this circle
 

179
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,249
and we usually go inside this circle
going the other way okay

180
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:31,259
going the other way okay
 

181
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,890
going the other way okay
so all of your ratio

182
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:33,900
so all of your ratio
 

183
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,330
so all of your ratio
techniques are

184
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,340
techniques are
 

185
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,770
techniques are
like that

186
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:36,780
like that
 

187
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,170
like that
the ones where we're coming in okay so

188
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,180
the ones where we're coming in okay so
 

189
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,150
the ones where we're coming in okay so
we're gonna use that second

190
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,160
we're gonna use that second
 

191
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,290
we're gonna use that second
so I go to the two on one because I

192
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,300
so I go to the two on one because I
 

193
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,870
so I go to the two on one because I
drive that gets most people to push

194
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:47,880
drive that gets most people to push
 

195
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,330
drive that gets most people to push
that's when I yield against his bow

196
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,340
that's when I yield against his bow
 

197
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,310
that's when I yield against his bow
honestly he's going to come in you see

198
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
honestly he's going to come in you see
 

199
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,890
honestly he's going to come in you see
well that's that same Circle he's going

200
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:54,900
well that's that same Circle he's going
 

201
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,290
well that's that same Circle he's going
around me I'm going to come inside his

202
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
around me I'm going to come inside his
 

203
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,710
around me I'm going to come inside his
Circle

204
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:03,720

 

205
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,490

that's right

206
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:06,500

 

207
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,730

inside his Circle

208
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:10,740

 

209
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,710

I don't care if you hold the arm right

210
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
I don't care if you hold the arm right
 

211
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,830
I don't care if you hold the arm right
now this work the pattern

212
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840

 

213
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,749

right here

214
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759

 

215
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,110

there's obviously the same timing so if

216
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
there's obviously the same timing so if
 

217
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,390
there's obviously the same timing so if
he pushes if I go like that this

218
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,400
he pushes if I go like that this
 

219
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,249
he pushes if I go like that this
technique doesn't work it's when he

220
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:31,259
technique doesn't work it's when he
 

221
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,230
technique doesn't work it's when he
pushes that's when this works

222
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,240
pushes that's when this works
 

223
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,809
pushes that's when this works
same way as when he pulls that's when

224
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:35,819
same way as when he pulls that's when
 

225
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,510
same way as when he pulls that's when
all those work it's not he pulls resist

226
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,520
all those work it's not he pulls resist
 

227
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,409
all those work it's not he pulls resist
and then go so same thing here he pushes

228
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:42,419
and then go so same thing here he pushes
 

229
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,469
and then go so same thing here he pushes
a yield

230
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
a yield
 

231
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,570
a yield
when he goes to stand up that's when I

232
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:47,580
when he goes to stand up that's when I
 

233
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,870
when he goes to stand up that's when I
go I can't be standing then I go

234
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
go I can't be standing then I go
 

235
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,029
go I can't be standing then I go
we're changing

236
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
we're changing
 

237
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:01,029
we're changing
places

238
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039

 

239
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,749

okay let's go

240
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:08,759

 

241
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,809

here's the elbow arm that's the one I

242
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:11,819
here's the elbow arm that's the one I
 

243
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,629
here's the elbow arm that's the one I
don't want to go up okay so I'll hold

244
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
don't want to go up okay so I'll hold
 

245
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,170
don't want to go up okay so I'll hold
the wrist arm as long as I need to to

246
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,180
the wrist arm as long as I need to to
 

247
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,029
the wrist arm as long as I need to to
get over here

248
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,039
get over here
 

249
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,309
get over here
you can still hold it if you want you

250
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
you can still hold it if you want you
 

251
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,110
you can still hold it if you want you
can still hold it but you don't need it

252
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,120
can still hold it but you don't need it
 

253
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,969
can still hold it but you don't need it
you can also come to the legs here on

254
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:25,979
you can also come to the legs here on
 

255
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,390
you can also come to the legs here on
the on the front

256
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400

 

257
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,249

right you do want to go around that

258
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,259
right you do want to go around that
 

259
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,749
right you do want to go around that
elbow arm

260
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:32,759
elbow arm
 

261
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,790
elbow arm
and the way you get around it is with

262
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
and the way you get around it is with
 

263
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:48,650
and the way you get around it is with
that same softness

264
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,660

 

265
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,790

okay let's go so uh let's say

266
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
okay let's go so uh let's say
 

267
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,450
okay let's go so uh let's say
uh I got a gate or he's like trying to

268
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:56,460
uh I got a gate or he's like trying to
 

269
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,309
uh I got a gate or he's like trying to
rip my badge off of me

270
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
rip my badge off of me
 

271
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,390
rip my badge off of me
oh do you get it so same same thing so

272
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
oh do you get it so same same thing so
 

273
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,210
oh do you get it so same same thing so
he he goes to grab oh look you're in the

274
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,220
he he goes to grab oh look you're in the
 

275
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,370
he he goes to grab oh look you're in the
same thing goes to grab oh you're just

276
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,380
same thing goes to grab oh you're just
 

277
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,330
same thing goes to grab oh you're just
thinking

278
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,340
thinking
 

279
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,150
thinking
he goes he does get a grip you're in the

280
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,160
he goes he does get a grip you're in the
 

281
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,990
he goes he does get a grip you're in the
same thing

282
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
same thing
 

283
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,930
same thing
he's got a clinch you can see he's

284
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:14,940
he's got a clinch you can see he's
 

285
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,510
he's got a clinch you can see he's
charging the clinch and and you're in

286
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
charging the clinch and and you're in
 

287
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,010
charging the clinch and and you're in
the same exactly

288
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,020
the same exactly
 

289
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,749
the same exactly
you guys see that you go right to the

290
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:20,759
you guys see that you go right to the
 

291
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,650
you guys see that you go right to the
two on one okay so uh

292
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:24,660
two on one okay so uh
 

293
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,150
two on one okay so uh
you can do it on a grab a clamp

294
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,160
you can do it on a grab a clamp
 

295
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,130
you can do it on a grab a clamp
you could do it on the ground just push

296
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,140
you could do it on the ground just push
 

297
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,290
you could do it on the ground just push
you could do it on the clintonship tab

298
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,300
you could do it on the clintonship tab
 

299
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,769
you could do it on the clintonship tab
boom and then start any of those

300
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:39,779
boom and then start any of those
 

301
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,990
boom and then start any of those
techniques that we went over okay all

302
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
techniques that we went over okay all
 

303
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,350
techniques that we went over okay all
right let's go

304
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360

 

305
00:08:45,360 --> 00:09:08,210

[Music]

306
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,220

 

307
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:20,240

foreign

308
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,250

 

309
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:32,100

[Music]

310
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,110

 

311
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,850

[Music]

312
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:33,860
[Music]
 

313
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,009
[Music]
and then I I think it's okay to go

314
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:37,019
and then I I think it's okay to go
 

315
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,230
and then I I think it's okay to go
through a phase where

316
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
through a phase where
 

317
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,509
through a phase where
kind of slowing the technique down

318
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
kind of slowing the technique down
 

319
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,190
kind of slowing the technique down
through contestation

320
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
through contestation
 

321
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,290
through contestation
you know just a little bit and then you

322
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:45,300
you know just a little bit and then you
 

323
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,990
you know just a little bit and then you
do some yields

324
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
do some yields
 

325
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,329
do some yields
that's okay that's like a growing phase

326
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:50,339
that's okay that's like a growing phase
 

327
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,030
that's okay that's like a growing phase
as long as you keep training and again

328
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
as long as you keep training and again
 

329
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,490
as long as you keep training and again
we all know what that means right four

330
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:55,500
we all know what that means right four
 

331
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,530
we all know what that means right four
to six hours a day listen to your

332
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,540
to six hours a day listen to your
 

333
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,570
to six hours a day listen to your
teacher do all the other supplemental

334
00:09:59,570 --> 00:09:59,580
teacher do all the other supplemental
 

335
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,269
teacher do all the other supplemental
trainings you'll get through that phase

336
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:02,279
trainings you'll get through that phase
 

337
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,790
trainings you'll get through that phase
but if you're pushing pushing pushing

338
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
but if you're pushing pushing pushing
 

339
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,590
but if you're pushing pushing pushing
forcing forcing Force that's a different

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,600
forcing forcing Force that's a different
 

341
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,009
forcing forcing Force that's a different
face do you understand so I'll describe

342
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:10,019
face do you understand so I'll describe
 

343
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,329
face do you understand so I'll describe
