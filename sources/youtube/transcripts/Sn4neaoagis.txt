I don't ever normally do the 2000 clap
unless there's a showman and uh where
the cameras are and that's uh where the
spirits live
so that you you do the clap to bring out
the small the small Spirits the small
ones to help you in training
but uh I thought it looked uh nice and
you have a good energy a little bit too
Lively at the moment
but you have a good energy so I thought
I'd do it because I felt as if it was
the right thing to do but normally I
wouldn't I just bow
so depending on who follows me where
around the country or different seminars
keep a close eye because sometimes I
will clap and sometimes not
but that's the reason why you do clap is
to bring out the
the small the spirits to help you train
okay please

enjoy this piece
