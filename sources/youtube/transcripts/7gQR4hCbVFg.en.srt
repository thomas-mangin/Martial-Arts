what kind of bird that is and then oh
you know I think those are Blue Jays and

338
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,030
you know I think those are Blue Jays and
 

339
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,910
you know I think those are Blue Jays and
then oh I wonder if they're on the roof

340
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:07,920
then oh I wonder if they're on the roof
 

341
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,950
then oh I wonder if they're on the roof
or you know so so you see how my mind

342
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:09,960
or you know so so you see how my mind
 

343
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,320
or you know so so you see how my mind
starts following down following that

344
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,330
starts following down following that
 

345
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,590
starts following down following that
that thought that I had right now

346
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:14,600
that thought that I had right now
 

347
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,120
that thought that I had right now
ideally you're always going to do that

348
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,130
ideally you're always going to do that
 

349
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,610
ideally you're always going to do that
you're never going to stop going birds

350
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:19,620
you're never going to stop going birds
 

351
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,360
you're never going to stop going birds
right

352
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,370
right
 

353
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,150
right
you'll probably always say Birds or

354
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,160
you'll probably always say Birds or
 

355
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,340
you'll probably always say Birds or
whatever right ideally where you want to

356
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,350
whatever right ideally where you want to
 

357
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,320
whatever right ideally where you want to
get though is to where there is nothing

358
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,330
get though is to where there is nothing
 

359
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,690
get though is to where there is nothing
that goes with the birds right you know

360
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:29,700
that goes with the birds right you know
 

361
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,310
that goes with the birds right you know
there's birds but there's nothing that

362
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,320
there's birds but there's nothing that
 

363
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,470
there's birds but there's nothing that
goes with it right and so for example a

364
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:33,480
goes with it right and so for example a
 

365
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,120
goes with it right and so for example a
little better than the one example I

366
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,130
little better than the one example I
 

367
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,970
little better than the one example I
just gave less Birds oh I think they're

368
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980
just gave less Birds oh I think they're
 

369
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,550
just gave less Birds oh I think they're
Blue Jays let that go right so like the

370
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:40,560
Blue Jays let that go right so like the
 

371
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,080
Blue Jays let that go right so like the
sooner you can let go of that thought

372
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,090
sooner you can let go of that thought
 

373
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,730
sooner you can let go of that thought
the better and then you'll get to a

374
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:43,740
the better and then you'll get to a
 

375
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,410
the better and then you'll get to a
smaller and smaller hotspot where

376
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,420
smaller and smaller hotspot where
 

377
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,810
smaller and smaller hotspot where
there's not really thoughts exactly to

378
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:47,820
there's not really thoughts exactly to
 

379
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,250
there's not really thoughts exactly to
go with it and like my thoughts I mean

380
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,260
go with it and like my thoughts I mean
 

381
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,430
go with it and like my thoughts I mean
an attachment to what that thought was

382
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,440
an attachment to what that thought was
 

383
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,110
an attachment to what that thought was
and and why this is a problem is because

384
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,120
and and why this is a problem is because
 

385
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,380
and and why this is a problem is because
it's not being in the moment right so so

386
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,390
it's not being in the moment right so so
 

387
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,210
it's not being in the moment right so so
what moments are these tiny little

388
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,220
what moments are these tiny little
 

389
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,240
what moments are these tiny little
fractions of time like these slivers

390
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,250
fractions of time like these slivers
 

391
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,880
fractions of time like these slivers
sliver slivers of time and so when that

392
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:04,890
sliver slivers of time and so when that
 

393
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,970
sliver slivers of time and so when that
moments here and gone it's here and gone

394
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:07,980
moments here and gone it's here and gone
 

395
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,160
moments here and gone it's here and gone
but we have a tendency to use our

396
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,170
but we have a tendency to use our
 

397
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,890
but we have a tendency to use our
conscious mind to to prolong those

398
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:12,900
conscious mind to to prolong those
 

399
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,690
conscious mind to to prolong those
moments right to to make them seem like

400
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:14,700
moments right to to make them seem like
 

401
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,250
moments right to to make them seem like
they're longer than they actually are

402
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,260
they're longer than they actually are
 

403
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,470
they're longer than they actually are
and it does a lot of weird stuff

404
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
and it does a lot of weird stuff
 

405
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,520
and it does a lot of weird stuff
that we could talk about that's kind of

406
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,530
that we could talk about that's kind of
 

407
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,049
that we could talk about that's kind of
esoteric and we won't get into it but

408
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:21,059
esoteric and we won't get into it but
 

409
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,080
esoteric and we won't get into it but
but basically it takes me out of the

410
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,090
but basically it takes me out of the
 

411
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,330
but basically it takes me out of the
moment because I'm prolonging one moment

412
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:26,340
moment because I'm prolonging one moment
 

413
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
moment because I'm prolonging one moment
that's already passed I'm missing the

414
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,350
that's already passed I'm missing the
 

415
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,140
that's already passed I'm missing the
new moments that are coming in and I

416
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,150
new moments that are coming in and I
 

417
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,880
new moments that are coming in and I
always want to be present for the new

418
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:31,890
always want to be present for the new
 

419
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,200
always want to be present for the new
moments that are coming in at least when

420
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,210
moments that are coming in at least when
 

421
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,520
moments that are coming in at least when
I'm doing that kind of meditation right

422
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:34,530
I'm doing that kind of meditation right
 

423
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,659

now I'm not saying it's how you live
 

425
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:36,919
now I'm not saying it's how you live
your life right there's times when you

426
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:36,929
your life right there's times when you
 

427
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,419
your life right there's times when you
need to be analytical about things and

428
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:38,429
need to be analytical about things and
 

429
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,799
need to be analytical about things and
times when you need to be in a flow

430
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:39,809
times when you need to be in a flow
 

431
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,000
times when you need to be in a flow

different ways but we're doing this
observational meditation the idea is to

436
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,250
observational meditation the idea is to
 

437
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,240
observational meditation the idea is to
let go of a thought as soon as possible

438
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,250
let go of a thought as soon as possible
 

439
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,520
let go of a thought as soon as possible
to detach from that thought as soon as
