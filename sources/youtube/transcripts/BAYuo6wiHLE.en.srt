1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,270

okay so again

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
okay so again
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,829
okay so again
we're going to this drill he's going to

4
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
we're going to this drill he's going to
 

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,510
we're going to this drill he's going to
take turns hitting at that

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
take turns hitting at that
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,910
take turns hitting at that
hand okay and i am yielding and

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920

 

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,950

disturbing

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960

 

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,870

so it's not enough that i just

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
so it's not enough that i just
 

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,070
so it's not enough that i just
let him not hit me it's

14
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
let him not hit me it's
 

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,150
let him not hit me it's
he goes and i have his balance

16
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
he goes and i have his balance
 

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,950
he goes and i have his balance
then it's not enough that i don't want

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
then it's not enough that i don't want
 

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,069
then it's not enough that i don't want
to hit me

20
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
to hit me
 

21
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,510
to hit me
you don't have his balance by externally

22
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
you don't have his balance by externally
 

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,350
you don't have his balance by externally
pushing so whom you see

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
pushing so whom you see
 

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,869
pushing so whom you see
so i try to be relaxed

26
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
so i try to be relaxed
 

27
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,229
so i try to be relaxed
and i try to uh let his energy

28
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
and i try to uh let his energy
 

29
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,110
and i try to uh let his energy
do it okay so this isn't gonna be good

30
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
do it okay so this isn't gonna be good
 

31
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,150
do it okay so this isn't gonna be good
enough

32
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
enough
 

33
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:03,270
enough
i'm trying to relax

34
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280

 

35
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,469

if your nugget is always on the

36
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
if your nugget is always on the
 

37
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,429
if your nugget is always on the
outside try to get on the outside if

38
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
outside try to get on the outside if
 

39
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,950
outside try to get on the outside if
they're always on the inside

40
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
they're always on the inside
 

41
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,590
they're always on the inside
try to get to the inside okay so that

42
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
try to get to the inside okay so that
 

43
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:38,830
try to get to the inside okay so that
you're always working

44
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840

 

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:48,870

so

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880

 

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:02:09,589

then be relaxed like emotionally

48
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599

 

49
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,910

and i would recommend you don't throw

50
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
and i would recommend you don't throw
 

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,110
and i would recommend you don't throw
them every time

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
them every time
 

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,830
them every time
you're just wasting time on your breath

54
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
you're just wasting time on your breath
 

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,750
you're just wasting time on your breath
cycle

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
cycle
 

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,949
cycle
so i tend to just do little

58
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
so i tend to just do little
 

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:38,150
so i tend to just do little
little displacements

60
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160

 

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,670

okay so

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
okay so
 

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,550
okay so
it's not really a skill where

64
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
it's not really a skill where
 

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,030
it's not really a skill where
understanding does anything to you

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
understanding does anything to you
 

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,750
understanding does anything to you
although if you don't understand what

68
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
although if you don't understand what
 

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,070
although if you don't understand what
you're

70
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
you're
 

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,110
you're
seeing then your mind dismisses it

72
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
seeing then your mind dismisses it
 

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,790
seeing then your mind dismisses it
as faith because you can't you don't

74
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
as faith because you can't you don't
 

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,710
as faith because you can't you don't
know what you're seeing

76
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
know what you're seeing
 

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,390
know what you're seeing
so let me give you some context here so

78
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
so let me give you some context here so
 

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,869
so let me give you some context here so
he there is an agreement in that he has

80
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
he there is an agreement in that he has
 

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,790
he there is an agreement in that he has
a target selection but it's an

82
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
a target selection but it's an
 

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,070
a target selection but it's an
upper thoracic cavity okay that's where

84
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
upper thoracic cavity okay that's where
 

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,110
upper thoracic cavity okay that's where
i want

86
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
i want
 

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,869
i want
to experience this okay

88
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879

 

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,990

so uh when he goes and i

90
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
so uh when he goes and i
 

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,430
so uh when he goes and i
reach contact you do understand the

92
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
reach contact you do understand the
 

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,630
reach contact you do understand the
parry everyone does like that's what

94
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
parry everyone does like that's what
 

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,830
parry everyone does like that's what
stops it from hitting

96
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840

 

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,869

but you don't understand how that

98
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
but you don't understand how that
 

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,550
but you don't understand how that
connects to his center

100
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
connects to his center
 

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,990
connects to his center
okay so the first way it connects to his

102
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
okay so the first way it connects to his
 

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,190
okay so the first way it connects to his
center

104
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
center
 

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,470
center
is that it does not contest even in its

106
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
is that it does not contest even in its
 

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,110
is that it does not contest even in its
parry so he goes and i'm not going like

108
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
parry so he goes and i'm not going like
 

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,509
parry so he goes and i'm not going like
that i did stop that from hitting me

110
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
that i did stop that from hitting me
 

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,630
that i did stop that from hitting me
but i i was not able to use his

112
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
but i i was not able to use his
 

113
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,270
but i i was not able to use his
energy in a kind of extension

114
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
energy in a kind of extension
 

115
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,270
energy in a kind of extension
and a movement of his center so

116
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
and a movement of his center so
 

117
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,789
and a movement of his center so
i do come up and i do make it miss me

118
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
i do come up and i do make it miss me
 

119
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,309
i do come up and i do make it miss me
but it has an inertia that's going

120
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
but it has an inertia that's going
 

121
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,509
but it has an inertia that's going
straight and i'm going to use that

122
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
straight and i'm going to use that
 

123
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,160
straight and i'm going to use that
inertia

that i do not stop him from coming in

130
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
that i do not stop him from coming in
 

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,670
that i do not stop him from coming in
and that i do not lose connection with

his with his hand
 

135
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,629
his with his hand
so i just gently extending it extending

136
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
so i just gently extending it extending
 

137
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,670
so i just gently extending it extending
and extending it

so this is different
different so extend

faster than his hand is going i'm going
to have a different

176
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
to have a different
 

177
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,029
to have a different
uh inertia in this direction a different

178
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
uh inertia in this direction a different
 

179
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,629
uh inertia in this direction a different
inertia value that he has

180
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
inertia value that he has
 

181
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,029
inertia value that he has
and that's how you come off of it but if

182
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
and that's how you come off of it but if
 

183
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,590
and that's how you come off of it but if
i keep the same one i can

184
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
i keep the same one i can
 

185
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,670
i keep the same one i can
extend it i also have

186
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
extend it i also have
 

187
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,070
extend it i also have
let's say he's doing that again and i'm

188
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
let's say he's doing that again and i'm
 

189
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,469
let's say he's doing that again and i'm
on the inside

190
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
on the inside
 

191
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,110
on the inside
so again i might move the target this

192
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
so again i might move the target this
 

193
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,510
so again i might move the target this
time

194
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
time
 

195
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,629
time
and i'll do it on the inside

196
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639

 

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,150

and these little uh manipulations of his

198
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
and these little uh manipulations of his
 

199
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,710
and these little uh manipulations of his
center

200
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
center
 

201
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,670
center
are really that that was enough you

202
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
are really that that was enough you
 

203
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,990
are really that that was enough you
don't

204
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
don't
 

205
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,590
don't
you in training you can go like this but

206
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
you in training you can go like this but
 

207
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,550
you in training you can go like this but
this is enough that's enough versus

208
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
this is enough that's enough versus
 

209
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,990
this is enough that's enough versus
nothing

210
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
nothing
 

211
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,029
nothing
so just enough

212
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
so just enough
 

213
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,990
so just enough
and this internal aspect is conjoined

214
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
and this internal aspect is conjoined
 

215
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,550
and this internal aspect is conjoined
with

216
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
with
 

217
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,590
with
another internal aspect which is uh the

218
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
another internal aspect which is uh the
 

219
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,749
another internal aspect which is uh the
young version of that same one which is

220
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
young version of that same one which is
 

221
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,870
young version of that same one which is
the koku one

222
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
the koku one
 

223
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,150
the koku one
so for example going like this

224
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
so for example going like this
 

225
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,510
so for example going like this
he can feel this thing going you see

226
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
he can feel this thing going you see
 

227
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,909
he can feel this thing going you see
and he's going to want to pull it back

228
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
and he's going to want to pull it back
 

229
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,950
and he's going to want to pull it back
and that helps

230
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
and that helps
 

231
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,390
and that helps
generate more friction but i stay with

232
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
generate more friction but i stay with
 

233
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,749
generate more friction but i stay with
it

234
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
it
 

235
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,309
it
right he wants to do that so he feels

236
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
right he wants to do that so he feels
 

237
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,670
right he wants to do that so he feels
his center going back

238
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
his center going back
 

239
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,990
his center going back
if he does not or going forward if he

240
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
if he does not or going forward if he
 

241
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,990
if he does not or going forward if he
does not feel his center going back

242
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
does not feel his center going back
 

243
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,629
does not feel his center going back
he doesn't really pull back he doesn't

244
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
he doesn't really pull back he doesn't
 

245
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,390
he doesn't really pull back he doesn't
have to regain his balance

246
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
have to regain his balance
 

247
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,110
have to regain his balance
so when i get that inch and he pulls it

248
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
so when i get that inch and he pulls it
 

249
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,510
so when i get that inch and he pulls it
back

250
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
back
 

251
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,150
back
i just stay with it do you see and that

252
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
i just stay with it do you see and that
 

253
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,990
i just stay with it do you see and that
can bring me into

254
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
can bring me into
 

255
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,350
can bring me into
my second aspect as i aim that energy

256
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
my second aspect as i aim that energy
 

257
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,469
my second aspect as i aim that energy
into his center again so i have an inch

258
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
into his center again so i have an inch
 

259
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:54,870
into his center again so i have an inch
there

260
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
there
 

261
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,230
there
he pulls and then i push and i get the

262
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
he pulls and then i push and i get the
 

263
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,510
he pulls and then i push and i get the
balance disturbance

264
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
balance disturbance
 

265
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,110
balance disturbance
okay so let's say i go this way

266
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
okay so let's say i go this way
 

267
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,469
okay so let's say i go this way
he feels the push you see so he wants to

268
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
he feels the push you see so he wants to
 

269
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,350
he feels the push you see so he wants to
come around

270
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
come around
 

271
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,189
come around
so he comes around and i do the same

272
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
so he comes around and i do the same
 

273
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,629
so he comes around and i do the same
thing on the other side

274
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639

 

275
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,589

in other words if i stay here he pulls

276
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
in other words if i stay here he pulls
 

277
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:15,990
in other words if i stay here he pulls
back

278
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
back
 

279
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,150
back
that's what you see and then the strike

280
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
that's what you see and then the strike
 

281
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,350
that's what you see and then the strike
comes again right

282
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
comes again right
 

283
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,629
comes again right
so but because i stay with it i can do

284
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
so but because i stay with it i can do
 

285
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,430
so but because i stay with it i can do
it

286
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
it
 

287
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,589
it
and then you're like why does why did he

288
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
and then you're like why does why did he
 

289
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,950
and then you're like why does why did he
leave his hand there

290
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
leave his hand there
 

291
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,150
leave his hand there
his hand gets kind of pinned you see

292
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
his hand gets kind of pinned you see
 

293
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,309
his hand gets kind of pinned you see
and in the same way that when he feels

294
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
and in the same way that when he feels
 

295
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,510
and in the same way that when he feels
his balance breaking

296
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
his balance breaking
 

297
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,909
his balance breaking
he pushes on me this time and that's

298
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
he pushes on me this time and that's
 

299
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,749
he pushes on me this time and that's
what allows the projection

300
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
what allows the projection
 

301
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,029
what allows the projection
but maybe he's smart and he yields but i

302
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
but maybe he's smart and he yields but i
 

303
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,070
but maybe he's smart and he yields but i
now stick with it again if i go to

304
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
now stick with it again if i go to
 

305
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,710
now stick with it again if i go to
push and he goes bump then that's when

306
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
push and he goes bump then that's when
 

307
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,749
push and he goes bump then that's when
you see that connection

308
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
you see that connection
 

309
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,550
you see that connection
so it's not that he's leaving his hand

310
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
so it's not that he's leaving his hand
 

311
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,909
so it's not that he's leaving his hand
on my hand

312
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
on my hand
 

313
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,230
on my hand
it's that i'm following his hand i'm

314
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
it's that i'm following his hand i'm
 

315
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,710
it's that i'm following his hand i'm
following his hand

316
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720

 

317
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,909

so he went here got a little one

318
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
so he went here got a little one
 

319
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,629
so he went here got a little one
little extension of his center he goes

320
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
little extension of his center he goes
 

321
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,029
little extension of his center he goes
back

322
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
back
 

323
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,390
back
i go with it i attack he yields i come

324
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
i go with it i attack he yields i come
 

325
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,189
i go with it i attack he yields i come
around and i come back the other way

326
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199

 

327
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,230

so wherever wherever he moves his hand i

328
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
so wherever wherever he moves his hand i
 

329
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,430
so wherever wherever he moves his hand i
just stay with it

330
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
just stay with it
 

331
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,830
just stay with it
wherever he moves his hand wherever he

332
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
wherever he moves his hand wherever he
 

333
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,710
wherever he moves his hand wherever he
goes

334
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
goes
 

335
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,670
goes
i stay with it it's not that he's

336
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
i stay with it it's not that he's
 

337
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,710
i stay with it it's not that he's
staying with me

338
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
staying with me
 

339
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,029
staying with me
which is what contemporary aikido does

340
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
which is what contemporary aikido does
 

341
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,830
which is what contemporary aikido does
okay

342
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
okay
 

343
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,830
okay
