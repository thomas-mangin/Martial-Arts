00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,480
ok today we're going to be looking at a
single called pendulum swings we'll also

single called pendulum swings we'll also

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,620
single called pendulum swings we'll also
take a look at basic and transfers

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,630
take a look at basic and transfers

00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,690

throughout these movements try and

10
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:14,700
throughout these movements try and
 

11
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,400
throughout these movements try and
imagine a connection between center of

12
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,410
imagine a connection between center of
 

13
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,490
imagine a connection between center of
your body and the cloth

I'm starting this movement by opening up

16
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
I'm starting this movement by opening up
 

17
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,179
I'm starting this movement by opening up
my right hip and letting the club to

18
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:23,189
my right hip and letting the club to
 

19
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,900
my right hip and letting the club to
swing from side to side

20
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:25,910
swing from side to side
 

21
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,279
swing from side to side
this starts to generate more momentum

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:28,289
this starts to generate more momentum
 

23
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,169
this starts to generate more momentum
with the club and it will start to lift

24
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:30,179
with the club and it will start to lift
 

25
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,870
with the club and it will start to lift
higher and higher if you know it's the

reduce my body movement the momentum of
 

47
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,520
reduce my body movement the momentum of
the club should also reduce and

48
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,530
the club should also reduce and
 

49
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,130
the club should also reduce and
eventually stop

in motion
 

119
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,000
in motion
so I get a feel for the movement and

120
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,010
so I get a feel for the movement and
 

121
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,500
so I get a feel for the movement and
there should be a point in the swing

122
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,510
there should be a point in the swing
 

123
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,470
there should be a point in the swing
where they call breaches its height and

124
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,480
where they call breaches its height and
 

125
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,890
where they call breaches its height and

it's at this point the club can be

128
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
it's at this point the club can be
 

129
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,860
it's at this point the club can be
transferred to the hands by giving it a

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:31,870
transferred to the hands by giving it a

slight push and passing it over
 

133
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,009
