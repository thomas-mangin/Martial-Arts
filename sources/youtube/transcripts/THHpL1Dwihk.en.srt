00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:12,420
let's let me do the opposite look what's
 

165
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,610
let's let me do the opposite look what's
happening you see there's a spaceship

166
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:18,620

 

167
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,800

any that'll happen maybe I do it I push

168
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:21,810
any that'll happen maybe I do it I push
 

169
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,409
any that'll happen maybe I do it I push
at first he starts to go and I put my

170
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:24,419
at first he starts to go and I put my
 

171
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,159
at first he starts to go and I put my
butt back and he'll peel out of my grid

172
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:27,169
butt back and he'll peel out of my grid
 

173
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,710
butt back and he'll peel out of my grid
so that's the third thing

174
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:29,720
so that's the third thing
 

175
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,420
so that's the third thing
no but back no head forward and no open

176
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,430
no but back no head forward and no open
 

177
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,630
no but back no head forward and no open
grip do you see that okay so let's just

178
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:38,640
grip do you see that okay so let's just
 

179
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,330
grip do you see that okay so let's just
start with this is going to be your

180
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
start with this is going to be your
 

181
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,570
start with this is going to be your
drill I am just going to displace him so

182
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:46,580
drill I am just going to displace him so
 

183
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:54,200
drill I am just going to displace him so
here and I move through him I'll do two

184
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,210
here and I move through him I'll do two
 

185
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:02,210
here and I move through him I'll do two
reps and that move three then he will do

186
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,220
reps and that move three then he will do
 

187
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,420
reps and that move three then he will do
title hair corresponds to that and I

188
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,430
title hair corresponds to that and I
 

189
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,780
title hair corresponds to that and I
will make sure there's no space on my

190
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:08,790
will make sure there's no space on my
 

191
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,920
will make sure there's no space on my
palm and I fall into that hole

192
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:14,930
palm and I fall into that hole
 

193
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:23,260
palm and I fall into that hole
from my initial attention watch the

194
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,270
from my initial attention watch the
 

195
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,209
from my initial attention watch the
difference tell me what you think is

196
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:25,219
difference tell me what you think is
 

197
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:33,700
difference tell me what you think is
different here I stepped into it I was

198
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:33,710
different here I stepped into it I was
 

199
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,980
different here I stepped into it I was
ahead that's wise you could see that I

200
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:35,990
ahead that's wise you could see that I
 

201
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,469
ahead that's wise you could see that I
stepped into it you see so I'm still

202
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
stepped into it you see so I'm still
 

203
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,119
stepped into it you see so I'm still
trying to be in control

204
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:40,129
trying to be in control
 

205
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,730
trying to be in control
that's choreography and it's a fear

206
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:42,740
that's choreography and it's a fear
 

207
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,260
that's choreography and it's a fear
response okay you don't like the whole

208
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,270
response okay you don't like the whole
 

209
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,879
response okay you don't like the whole
so you go I'm gonna step into space

210
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:50,889
so you go I'm gonna step into space
 

211
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:58,899
so you go I'm gonna step into space
no it's falling this space okay so fewer

212
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:58,909
no it's falling this space okay so fewer
 

213
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,899
no it's falling this space okay so fewer
XS final displacement then two reps

214
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:01,909
XS final displacement then two reps
 

215
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,719
XS final displacement then two reps
checking for these three things but head

216
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:04,729
checking for these three things but head
 

217
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,760
checking for these three things but head
grip and get your falling into the hole

218
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:08,770
grip and get your falling into the hole
 

219
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:22,360
grip and get your falling into the hole
so we came to the second half okay so

220
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,370
so we came to the second half okay so
 

221
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,790
so we came to the second half okay so
obviously there's a skill it is a skill

222
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
obviously there's a skill it is a skill
 

223
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,320
obviously there's a skill it is a skill
set so I probably can't get it up first

224
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,330
set so I probably can't get it up first
 

225
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,540
set so I probably can't get it up first
the problem is that it's not just a

226
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:31,550
the problem is that it's not just a
 

227
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,489
the problem is that it's not just a
physiological skill set it's a

228
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:33,499
physiological skill set it's a
 

229
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,540
physiological skill set it's a
psychological skill set okay so there's

230
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:37,550
psychological skill set okay so there's
 

231
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,409
psychological skill set okay so there's
a kind of physiological coordination

232
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:40,419
a kind of physiological coordination
 

233
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,659
a kind of physiological coordination
true but that coordination can totally

234
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:43,669
true but that coordination can totally
 

235
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,730
true but that coordination can totally
be inflation upon by a psychological

236
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:45,740
be inflation upon by a psychological
 

237
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,600
be inflation upon by a psychological
failure so in other words I I don't I

238
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:49,610
failure so in other words I I don't I
 

239
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,839
failure so in other words I I don't I
can't physically get the right correct

240
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:52,849
can't physically get the right correct
 

241
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,969
can't physically get the right correct
or the correct amount of flexion and and

242
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:56,979
or the correct amount of flexion and and
 

243
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:01,959
or the correct amount of flexion and and
relaxation in my posture and I'm afraid

244
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:01,969
relaxation in my posture and I'm afraid
 

245
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:04,989
relaxation in my posture and I'm afraid
and then that's gonna make you tense

246
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:04,999
and then that's gonna make you tense
 

247
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:11,879
and then that's gonna make you tense
everything okay or try to get ahead

248
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:11,889

 

249
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,890

so let's just look at the coordination

250
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:13,900
so let's just look at the coordination
 

251
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,309
so let's just look at the coordination
thing so when he pushes right what am i

252
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
thing so when he pushes right what am i
 

253
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,149
thing so when he pushes right what am i
what skills am i using here goodnight

254
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:24,159
what skills am i using here goodnight
 

255
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,119
what skills am i using here goodnight
grounding with that and my organization

256
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,129
grounding with that and my organization
 

257
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,300
grounding with that and my organization
if this is the coke Q skill to keep

258
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,310
if this is the coke Q skill to keep
 

259
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,089
if this is the coke Q skill to keep
things apart so a little bit and I

260
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:33,099
things apart so a little bit and I
 

261
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,190
things apart so a little bit and I
project it you understand

262
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
project it you understand
 

263
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,269
project it you understand
cook you projections separation there's

264
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
cook you projections separation there's
 

265
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,800
cook you projections separation there's
a grounding aspect to it

266
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:40,810
a grounding aspect to it
 

267
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,819
a grounding aspect to it
got it okay so here I am and what we're

268
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:44,829
got it okay so here I am and what we're
 

269
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,480
got it okay so here I am and what we're
doing what would what is this brings me

270
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,490
doing what would what is this brings me
 

271
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,930
doing what would what is this brings me
Bracey do you see if I push no

272
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:51,940
Bracey do you see if I push no
 

273
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,569
Bracey do you see if I push no
projection you see that this is just

tell you not to do look at your head

278
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,130
tell you not to do look at your head
 

279
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,940
tell you not to do look at your head
it's going forward okay let's change

280
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:05,950
it's going forward okay let's change
 

281
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,630
it's going forward okay let's change
roles what am i doing Bracey

282
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:09,640
roles what am i doing Bracey
 

283
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,740
roles what am i doing Bracey
I'm not grounding okay so just as he

284
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:13,750
I'm not grounding okay so just as he
 

285
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,639
I'm not grounding okay so just as he
pushes here I'm ground out well

286
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:17,649
pushes here I'm ground out well
 

287
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,100
pushes here I'm ground out well
now i ground his resistance I'm

288
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,110
now i ground his resistance I'm
 

289
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,079
now i ground his resistance I'm
grounding his resistance do you see that

290
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:22,089
grounding his resistance do you see that
 

291
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,380
grounding his resistance do you see that
and so this is why from step to step

292
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,390
and so this is why from step to step
 

293
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:35,930
and so this is why from step to step
I I can keep walking

294
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:35,940

 

295
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,340

so he can try to you try to reground as

296
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,350
so he can try to you try to reground as
 

297
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,850
so he can try to you try to reground as
i displace you okay so he's grounding

298
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:44,860
i displace you okay so he's grounding
 

299
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:56,000
i displace you okay so he's grounding
and I'm going to walk do you see that

300
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,010

 

301
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,570

would you go like this okay and the

302
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:00,580
would you go like this okay and the
 

303
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,020
would you go like this okay and the
whole thumbs you will fall into it but

304
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,030
whole thumbs you will fall into it but
 

305
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,530
whole thumbs you will fall into it but
if you pay attention you will have

306
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:07,540
if you pay attention you will have
 

307
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,610
if you pay attention you will have
disconnect and then when it should the

308
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:11,620
disconnect and then when it should the
 

309
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,280
disconnect and then when it should the
technique turn on me

310
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,290
technique turn on me
 

311
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,230
technique turn on me
whoa now I have lost the relationship

312
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,240
whoa now I have lost the relationship
 

313
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,480
whoa now I have lost the relationship
necessary for a character do you see

314
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,490
necessary for a character do you see
 

315
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,420
necessary for a character do you see
that so I am NOT a person who goes

316
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,430
that so I am NOT a person who goes
 

317
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,570
that so I am NOT a person who goes
flying in and then gets taken off

318
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:30,580
flying in and then gets taken off
 

319
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,120
flying in and then gets taken off
balance let me let's watch that skill

320
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,130
balance let me let's watch that skill
 

321
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,640
balance let me let's watch that skill
again that just happened okay so if

322
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:35,650
again that just happened okay so if
 

323
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,530
again that just happened okay so if
