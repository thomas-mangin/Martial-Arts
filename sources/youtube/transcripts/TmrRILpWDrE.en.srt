1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,070

i hear your timing through your descent

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
i hear your timing through your descent
 

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,150
i hear your timing through your descent
so you don't want to go down and cut

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
so you don't want to go down and cut
 

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:46,709
so you don't want to go down and cut
down

6
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719

 

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:01:07,510

is

8
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520

 

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,310

just touch down

10
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320

 

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,040

then we start using this

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,050
then we start using this
 

13
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:33,109
then we start using this
[Music]

14
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119

 

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,149

okay

16
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
okay
 

17
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,550
okay
that's a wrap try

18
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
that's a wrap try
 

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,030
that's a wrap try
okay so the next progression

20
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
okay so the next progression
 

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,030
okay so the next progression
is to get

22
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
is to get
 

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,030
is to get
an inward

24
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
an inward
 

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,190
an inward
front inward position pattern so he has

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
front inward position pattern so he has
 

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,590
front inward position pattern so he has
to tilt

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
to tilt
 

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,389
to tilt
so i get away from my acceleration

30
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
so i get away from my acceleration
 

31
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,469
so i get away from my acceleration
throws

32
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479

 

33
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,109

okay so my entry is a little different

34
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119

 

35
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,350

don't really have to turn around

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
don't really have to turn around
 

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,469
don't really have to turn around
okay

38
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
okay
 

39
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:21,990
okay
now i'm going here

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000

 

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:49,350

you can add your body to it

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360

 

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,750

so these throws where you drop below the

44
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
so these throws where you drop below the
 

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,990
so these throws where you drop below the
guy are always going to expose you

46
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
guy are always going to expose you
 

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,509
guy are always going to expose you
to

48
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
to
 

49
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,790
to
this

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
this
 

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,630
this
okay

52
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640

 

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,589

so

54
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
so
 

55
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,229
so
your timing has to be

56
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
your timing has to be
 

57
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,470
your timing has to be
of such a nature but you can't get me

58
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
of such a nature but you can't get me
 

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,309
of such a nature but you can't get me
out you see because i'm controlling the

60
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
out you see because i'm controlling the
 

61
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,949
out you see because i'm controlling the
elbow you can't get me because when i go

62
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
elbow you can't get me because when i go
 

63
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,550
elbow you can't get me because when i go
underneath

64
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
underneath
 

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,229
underneath
and he can get me

66
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
and he can get me
 

67
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,710
and he can get me
you see

68
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
you see
 

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,110
you see
so my next object

70
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
so my next object
 

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,190
so my next object
which is why i like the virgin i just

72
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
which is why i like the virgin i just
 

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,309
which is why i like the virgin i just
showed you

74
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
showed you
 

75
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,550
showed you
because i don't do this

76
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
because i don't do this
 

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,509
because i don't do this
and expose the neck

78
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
and expose the neck
 

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,990
and expose the neck
my next object of concern is the other

80
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
my next object of concern is the other
 

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,830
my next object of concern is the other
arm so just like i go under this armpit

82
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
arm so just like i go under this armpit
 

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,750
arm so just like i go under this armpit
i'm going to go under the other armpit

84
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
i'm going to go under the other armpit
 

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,949
i'm going to go under the other armpit
he goes

86
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
he goes
 

87
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,550
he goes
they're going to go under this armpit

88
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
they're going to go under this armpit
 

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,710
they're going to go under this armpit
here

90
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
here
 

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,149
here
and this way if he is trying to get you

92
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
and this way if he is trying to get you
 

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,470
and this way if he is trying to get you
it actually helps the throw

94
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
it actually helps the throw
 

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,070
it actually helps the throw
so we're just gonna do

96
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
so we're just gonna do
 

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,670
so we're just gonna do
this drill now

98
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
this drill now
 

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,550
this drill now
i'm gonna take the elbow hand off

100
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
i'm gonna take the elbow hand off
 

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,149
i'm gonna take the elbow hand off
i'm gonna go under

102
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
i'm gonna go under
 

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,229
i'm gonna go under
i will see his hand i'm gonna go under

104
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
i will see his hand i'm gonna go under
 

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,190
i will see his hand i'm gonna go under
this

106
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
this
 

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,949
this
okay let's do it again

108
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959

 

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:18,550

you see how close i stayed here

110
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560

 

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,990

always cognizant of that hand humming

112
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000

 

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,990

okay

114
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
okay
 

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,230
okay
okay we'll give that feeling and you

116
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
okay we'll give that feeling and you
 

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,950
okay we'll give that feeling and you
just

118
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
just
 

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,550
just
don't enter without being aware of what

120
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
don't enter without being aware of what
 

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,230
don't enter without being aware of what
that other hand is doing

122
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
that other hand is doing
 

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,310
that other hand is doing
okay and look to go

124
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
okay and look to go
 

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,270
okay and look to go
inside of it under the armpit okay try

126
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
inside of it under the armpit okay try
 

127
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,070
inside of it under the armpit okay try
it again so your angle deviation always

128
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
it again so your angle deviation always
 

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,710
it again so your angle deviation always
has to be coupled with your angle of

130
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
has to be coupled with your angle of
 

131
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,110
has to be coupled with your angle of
deflection so you see that when i put my

132
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
deflection so you see that when i put my
 

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,909
deflection so you see that when i put my
left hand here you can't get the choke

134
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
left hand here you can't get the choke
 

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,950
left hand here you can't get the choke
can't get the choke you get it

136
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960

 

137
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,030

so that's why we're here but then we're

138
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
so that's why we're here but then we're
 

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,030
so that's why we're here but then we're
going to slide to the inside i'm

140
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
going to slide to the inside i'm
 

141
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,950
going to slide to the inside i'm
basically going like this

142
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
basically going like this
 

143
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,550
basically going like this
you see it's going to be hard for him to

144
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
you see it's going to be hard for him to
 

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,350
you see it's going to be hard for him to
get that chip

146
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360

 

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,110

and that's also why

148
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
and that's also why
 

149
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,469
and that's also why
once i start the downward kazushi

150
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
once i start the downward kazushi
 

151
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,629
once i start the downward kazushi
so he's going down there's no there's no

152
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
so he's going down there's no there's no
 

153
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,230
so he's going down there's no there's no
more knee right there there's no more

154
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
more knee right there there's no more
 

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,590
more knee right there there's no more
knee you see

156
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
knee you see
 

157
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,189
knee you see
now what i have to do

158
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
now what i have to do
 

159
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,830
now what i have to do
is get the x pattern so

160
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
is get the x pattern so
 

161
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,590
is get the x pattern so
normally you get the x pattern by

162
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
normally you get the x pattern by
 

163
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,350
normally you get the x pattern by
pushing the hip

164
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
pushing the hip
 

165
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,390
pushing the hip
uh

166
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
uh
 

167
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,749
uh
that's not how we're going to do it on

168
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
that's not how we're going to do it on
 

169
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,550
that's not how we're going to do it on
this one i'm going to pull the head

170
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
this one i'm going to pull the head
 

171
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,150
this one i'm going to pull the head
okay

172
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
okay
 

173
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,710
okay
so his foot hits

174
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
so his foot hits
 

175
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,950
so his foot hits
the inertia takes that leg and then i'm

176
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
the inertia takes that leg and then i'm
 

177
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,749
the inertia takes that leg and then i'm
