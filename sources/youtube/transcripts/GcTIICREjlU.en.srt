by the time you get to Japanese martial
arts you have this you Building Concept

62
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:30,420
arts you have this you Building Concept
 

63
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,950
arts you have this you Building Concept
in as we would say in modern times the

64
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
in as we would say in modern times the
 

65
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,050
in as we would say in modern times the
in all of the Jiu Jitsu which would

66
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,060
in all of the Jiu Jitsu which would
 

67
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,770

include Aikido as well okay
 

69
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,929
include Aikido as well okay
um there's a yielding so if you reverse

70
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:41,939
um there's a yielding so if you reverse
 

71
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,630
um there's a yielding so if you reverse
engineer that means the attacker is uh

72
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:47,640
engineer that means the attacker is uh
 

73
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,330
engineer that means the attacker is uh
doing some energy that requires the

74
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,340
doing some energy that requires the
 

75
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,330
doing some energy that requires the
yielding so the attacker has to have

76
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,340
yielding so the attacker has to have
 

77
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,109
yielding so the attacker has to have
some degree of penetration in which you

78
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
some degree of penetration in which you
 

79
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,350
some degree of penetration in which you
would yield to that or turn right that

80
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
would yield to that or turn right that
 

81
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,109
would yield to that or turn right that
kind of stuff so

82
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
kind of stuff so
 

83
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,690
kind of stuff so
um we call that in English we call that

84
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:05,700
um we call that in English we call that
 

85
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,050
um we call that in English we call that
spinal displacement okay

86
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,060
spinal displacement okay
 

87
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,550
spinal displacement okay
um so if Tristan comes up

88
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,560

 

89
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,670

spinal displacement

90
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
spinal displacement
 

91
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,490
spinal displacement
is a human behavior

92
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:19,500

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,690
right now where his spine is standing in
space

104
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:35,700

00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:41,879
would attempt to occupy that space long
 

109
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,030
would attempt to occupy that space long
before I did any kind of violent stuff

110
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,040
before I did any kind of violent stuff
 

111

space do you see that okay so just

130
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
space do you see that okay so just
 

131
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,570
space do you see that okay so just
psychologically human beings that want

132

it is such though
that there is uh a sociological tie to a

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,589
strategic objectives one is take his
base compromise his base and support get

168
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
base compromise his base and support get
 

169
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,710
base compromise his base and support get
him get his balance and his posture to

170
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
him get his balance and his posture to
 

171
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,189
him get his balance and his posture to
be compromised okay so for example if

172
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
be compromised okay so for example if
 

173
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,949
be compromised okay so for example if
I'm here and I'm just kissing the

174
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
I'm here and I'm just kissing the
 

175
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,590
I'm here and I'm just kissing the
surface of this his posture is not

176
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
surface of this his posture is not
 

177
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,850
surface of this his posture is not
affected at all but if I go and I take

178
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:25,860
affected at all but if I go and I take
 

179
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,330
affected at all but if I go and I take
this spine in space and occupy it with

180
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,340
this spine in space and occupy it with
 

181
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,930
this spine in space and occupy it with
my jam boom you can see that it gets him

182
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:32,940
my jam boom you can see that it gets him
 

183
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,409
my jam boom you can see that it gets him
on his heels and going backwards it's

184
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:36,419
on his heels and going backwards it's
 

185
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,390
on his heels and going backwards it's
hard to change directions when you're

186
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
hard to change directions when you're
 

187
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,409
hard to change directions when you're
going One Direction and it's hard to uh

188
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:42,419
going One Direction and it's hard to uh
 

189
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,450
going One Direction and it's hard to uh
get a counter attack going when you're

190
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,460
get a counter attack going when you're
 

191
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,110
get a counter attack going when you're
on your heels so it leads to that and we

192
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,120
on your heels so it leads to that and we
 

193
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,450
on your heels so it leads to that and we
call this in modern time times a

call this in modern time times a
 

195
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,450
call this in modern time times a

violence of action so you see a lot of
people that assault human beings they

198
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:56,580
people that assault human beings they
 

199
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,090
