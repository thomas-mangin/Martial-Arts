179
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,950

I'm not doing those

180
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:25,960
I'm not doing those
 

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,230
I'm not doing those

okay try to understand that difference
 

185
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,070
okay try to understand that difference
because what I if you look at

186
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,080

00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:55,880
length but the assumption is that where
 

197
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,509
length but the assumption is that where
you touch on the arm you're actually

198
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:58,519
you touch on the arm you're actually
 

199
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,509
you touch on the arm you're actually
touching the

200
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:00,519
touching the
 

201
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,310
touching the
Center that's a huge assumption nowadays

202
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,320
Center that's a huge assumption nowadays
 

203
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,030
Center that's a huge assumption nowadays
because no one can touch the center from

204
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
because no one can touch the center from
 

205
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,430
because no one can touch the center from
the arms they they eventually pull the

206
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
the arms they they eventually pull the
 

207
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,350
the arms they they eventually pull the
skin suit and then that moves the center

208
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
skin suit and then that moves the center
 

209
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,509
skin suit and then that moves the center
eventually do you understand and that's

210
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:16,519
eventually do you understand and that's
 

211
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,030
eventually do you understand and that's
not going to that that that does not

212
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
not going to that that that does not
 

213
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,750
not going to that that that does not

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,829
Center I'm actually one of his basis
supports and when he tries to get

252
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:46,839
supports and when he tries to get
 

253
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,550
supports and when he tries to get
another Bas of support which he would

254
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,560
another Bas of support which he would
 

255
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,190
another Bas of support which he would
have to do to try to get off of the

have to do to try to get off of the
 

257
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,030
have to do to try to get off of the
initial control he's actually taking his

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,040
initial control he's actually taking his
 

259
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,509
initial control he's actually taking his
line of gravity outside of his base of

line of gravity outside of his base of
 

261
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,590
line of gravity outside of his base of
support and that's what makes him fall

262
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
support and that's what makes him fall
 

263
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,790

GE okay so let's try it don't pull their

272
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
GE okay so let's try it don't pull their
 

273
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:26,949
GE okay so let's try it don't pull their
wrist okay

279
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,790

him so we do tilting

280
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800

 

281
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,629

sides of his Center and turning the

284
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
sides of his Center and turning the
 

285
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,670

move ever so

294
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
move ever so
 

295
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,949
move ever so
slightly without his Center moving you

296
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
slightly without his Center moving you
 

297
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,870
slightly without his Center moving you
see that so here he is I don't affect

here right so watch for that so you you
 

305
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,230
here right so watch for that so you you
want to pay attention to his spine as

want to pay attention to his spine as
 

307
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,350

can you can look at his Center too and
 

311
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,750
can you can look at his Center too and
when does it start to be affected from

312
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
when does it start to be affected from
 

313
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,350
when does it start to be affected from
the position it is in now not till there

with

522
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240

 

523
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:10,549

me

524
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559

 

525
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:18,950

okay try it again all right uh the

phase where you are just
 

531
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,710
phase where you are just
externally pushing on the center get I

532
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
externally pushing on the center get I
 

533
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,789
externally pushing on the center get I
think you have to to get rid of the skin

534
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:31,799
think you have to to get rid of the skin
 

535
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,310

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
suit idea
 

537
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,149
suit idea
okay well when we when we affect the

538
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:37,159
okay well when we when we affect the
 

539
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,710
okay well when we when we affect the
center we're not just pushing okay do

540
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
center we're not just pushing okay do
 

541
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,549
center we're not just pushing okay do
you

542
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:43,559

 

543
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,029

understand because that'll never work on

544
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:46,039
understand because that'll never work on
 

545
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,270
understand because that'll never work on
the Y phase if you if you're externally

546
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
the Y phase if you if you're externally
 

547
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,950
the Y phase if you if you're externally
just pushing on the

548
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
just pushing on the
 

549
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,870
just pushing on the
center when you do a Yin phase in your

550
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
center when you do a Yin phase in your
 

551
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,110
center when you do a Yin phase in your
tabaki you're going to lose Center

552
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
tabaki you're going to lose Center
 

553
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,909
tabaki you're going to lose Center
connection because your hands come in in

554
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
connection because your hands come in in
 

555
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,710
connection because your hands come in in
the opposite direction okay so uh as for

556
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
the opposite direction okay so uh as for
 

557
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,070
the opposite direction okay so uh as for
example I want to he he's really strong

over do you see and so you're going to

562
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
over do you see and so you're going to
 

563
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,269
over do you see and so you're going to
take off some of that with the yin phase

564
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:15,279
take off some of that with the yin phase
 

565
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,190
take off some of that with the yin phase
of some kind do you

566
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
of some kind do you
 

567
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,710
of some kind do you
understand so right here if you're here

568

back you don't have the center do do you
 

575
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,870
back you don't have the center do do you
understand so you saw how his he his

body came towards me okay as a easy
 

579
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,510
body came towards me okay as a easy
example but there's no reason why your

580
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
example but there's no reason why your
 

581
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,909
example but there's no reason why your
hand can't come back and is still moving

582

hand can't come back and is still moving
 

583
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:57,029
hand can't come back and is still moving
his body you

584
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039

 

585
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,430

see you understand so in other words we

586
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
see you understand so in other words we
 

587
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,590
see you understand so in other words we
already talked about the skin suit and

588
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:04,600
already talked about the skin suit and
 

589
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,390
already talked about the skin suit and
uh he should be uh Center to Center

590
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
uh he should be uh Center to Center
 

591
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,350
uh he should be uh Center to Center
manipulation is happening on contact uh

592
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,360
manipulation is happening on contact uh
 

593
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,390
manipulation is happening on contact uh
and so in the same way that I don't use

594
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
and so in the same way that I don't use

get enough tension in them to now pull
 

599
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,750
get enough tension in them to now pull
on his Center in the same way I don't

600
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
on his Center in the same way I don't
 

601
