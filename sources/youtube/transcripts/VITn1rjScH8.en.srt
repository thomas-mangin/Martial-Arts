1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,909

what we're doing is uh

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
what we're doing is uh
 

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,670
what we're doing is uh
we're tempting the mind

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
we're tempting the mind
 

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,950
we're tempting the mind
to stay in that first mind aspect in the

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
to stay in that first mind aspect in the
 

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,350
to stay in that first mind aspect in the
functioning of the ego tripartite

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
functioning of the ego tripartite
 

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,269
functioning of the ego tripartite
by generating uh the fear and triggering

10
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:17,279
by generating uh the fear and triggering
 

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,189
by generating uh the fear and triggering
the fear response and the world's power

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
the fear response and the world's power
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,230
the fear response and the world's power
reactivity

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
reactivity
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,550
reactivity
okay um and it doesn't take much to do

16
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
okay um and it doesn't take much to do
 

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,670
okay um and it doesn't take much to do
that to people

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
that to people
 

19
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,109
that to people
okay so you can keep this

20
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
okay so you can keep this
 

21
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,750
okay so you can keep this
in a normal let's say one person so a

22
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
in a normal let's say one person so a
 

23
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,470
in a normal let's say one person so a
normal g

24
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
normal g
 

25
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,990
normal g
was uh and we're just going

26
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000

 

27
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,470

in i'm not over here predicting ahead of

28
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
in i'm not over here predicting ahead of
 

29
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,110
in i'm not over here predicting ahead of
time

30
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
time
 

31
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,229
time
that's not what i'm doing as he triggers

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
that's not what i'm doing as he triggers
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,350
that's not what i'm doing as he triggers
my mind

34
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
my mind
 

35
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,430
my mind
right here he triggered he triggered me

36
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
right here he triggered he triggered me
 

37
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,389
right here he triggered he triggered me
and got the will to power

38
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
and got the will to power
 

39
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,350
and got the will to power
and so in in that is where i do my

40
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
and so in in that is where i do my
 

41
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,350
and so in in that is where i do my
release

42
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
release
 

43
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,750
release
and find the technique

44
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
and find the technique
 

45
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,149
and find the technique
okay something different would be

46
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
okay something different would be
 

47
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,230
okay something different would be
me predicting ahead of time and i'm

48
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
me predicting ahead of time and i'm
 

49
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,830
me predicting ahead of time and i'm
you're just taking advantage of knowing

50
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
you're just taking advantage of knowing
 

51
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,950
you're just taking advantage of knowing
what's coming in

52
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
what's coming in
 

53
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,429
what's coming in
if this technique is so simple this g

54
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
if this technique is so simple this g
 

55
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,070
if this technique is so simple this g
was this

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080

environment is so simple that you have

58
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
environment is so simple that you have
 

59
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,670
environment is so simple that you have
to

60
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
to
 

61
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,710
to
not predict you have to release

62
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
not predict you have to release
 

63
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,350
not predict you have to release
and then secondly um you're never

64
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
and then secondly um you're never
 

65
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,070
and then secondly um you're never
muscling you're never muscling

66
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
muscling you're never muscling
 

67
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,590
muscling you're never muscling
okay but some don't realize that they

68
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
okay but some don't realize that they
 

69
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,149
okay but some don't realize that they
don't real they don't see that

70
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
don't real they don't see that
 

71
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,590
don't real they don't see that
so we add a second guy and that would be

72
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
so we add a second guy and that would be
 

73
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,710
so we add a second guy and that would be
enough

74
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
enough
 

75
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,230
enough
to amplify and make visible so i'm going

76
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
to amplify and make visible so i'm going
 

77
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,109
to amplify and make visible so i'm going
and you see i'm stuck on him you see as

78
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
and you see i'm stuck on him you see as
 

79
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,590
and you see i'm stuck on him you see as
i pick my technique

80
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
i pick my technique
 

81
00:01:43,600 --> 00:02:06,830
i pick my technique
the mind has to find the uh

82
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

83
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:21,120

so

84
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,130

 

85
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,510

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520

 

87
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,869

so you see i never lose the other guy

88
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
so you see i never lose the other guy
 

89
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,790
so you see i never lose the other guy
my mind is constantly releasing

90
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
my mind is constantly releasing
 

91
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,229
my mind is constantly releasing
okay let's try

92
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239

 

93
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:46,710

the mine's on andrew and you lost spring

94
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720

 

95
00:02:46,720 --> 00:03:02,830

so don't wait you don't need to wait

96
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840

 

97
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,090

uh

98
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,100
