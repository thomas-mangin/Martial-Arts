00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,509
mutual stance I now bring
over and I

over and I
 

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,870
over and I
cut it covers the Rest by about 7 cm he

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:25,880
cut it covers the Rest by about 7 cm he
 

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,109
cut it covers the Rest by about 7 cm he
releases me I lift and he enters he

14
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,119
releases me I lift and he enters he
 

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,190
releases me I lift and he enters he
should feel comfortable on he should be

16
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,200
should feel comfortable on he should be
 

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,910
should feel comfortable on he should be
5050 on his feet I watch him as he holds

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
5050 on his feet I watch him as he holds
 

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,150
5050 on his feet I watch him as he holds
me

20
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
me
 

21
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,110
me
off and and then I cut here slightly

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,120
off and and then I cut here slightly
 

23
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,549
off and and then I cut here slightly
around this way then this means it will

24
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:45,559
around this way then this means it will
 

25
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,910
around this way then this means it will
cut my whole head

26
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
cut my whole head
 

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,750
cut my whole head
off if we don't do that if I if I Just

28
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
off if we don't do that if I if I Just
 

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,990
off if we don't do that if I if I Just
Step

30
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,000
Step
 

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,229
Step
straight if I Just Step straight this

32
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
straight if I Just Step straight this
 

33
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,029
straight if I Just Step straight this
what happens and it only Nicks the the

34
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
what happens and it only Nicks the the
 

35
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,830
what happens and it only Nicks the the
neck this is incorrect so when he pulls

36
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
neck this is incorrect so when he pulls
 

37
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,870
neck this is incorrect so when he pulls
back for the wrist he'll

38
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:04,880
back for the wrist he'll
 

39
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,590
back for the wrist he'll
now exactly so it throws out all all the

40
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
now exactly so it throws out all all the
 

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,910
now exactly so it throws out all all the
measurements okay so he releases

42
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:12,920
measurements okay so he releases
 

43
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,830
measurements okay so he releases
me and then

44
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
me and then
 

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,749
me and then
here

46
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759

 

47
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,190

so so these are the points that are

48
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,200
so so these are the points that are
 

49
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,550
so so these are the points that are
important we'll just change camera

50
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
important we'll just change camera
 

51
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,149
important we'll just change camera
angles

52
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:31,159

 

53
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,550

okay

54
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
okay
 

55
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,590
okay
so so it doesn't matter who adjusts as

56
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
so so it doesn't matter who adjusts as
 

57
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,510
so so it doesn't matter who adjusts as
long as we get to this point

58
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
long as we get to this point
 

59
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,910
long as we get to this point
here so I'm going to like letting air

60
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:42,920
here so I'm going to like letting air
 

61
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,230
here so I'm going to like letting air
out of a

62
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,240
out of a
 

63
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,789
out of a
balloon this is the F

64
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
balloon this is the F
 

65
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,630
balloon this is the F
so watch the front foot it it operates

66
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
so watch the front foot it it operates
 

67
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,310
so watch the front foot it it operates
through out my

68
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
through out my
 

69
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,310
through out my
body it doesn't it doesn't just lift and

70
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
body it doesn't it doesn't just lift and
 

71
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,550
body it doesn't it doesn't just lift and
then I step forward I'm connected all

72
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
then I step forward I'm connected all
 

73
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,950
then I step forward I'm connected all
the way through my

74
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
the way through my
 

75
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:22,990
the way through my
body here and I adjust

76
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,000

 

77
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,229

back wrist releases the wrist I lift and

78
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
back wrist releases the wrist I lift and
 

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,670
back wrist releases the wrist I lift and
I watch him

80
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
I watch him
 

81
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,869
I watch him
and I watch him and I step slightly and

82
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:33,879
and I watch him and I step slightly and
 

83
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,150
and I watch him and I step slightly and
that's what makes

84
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,160

 

85
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,430

the go through my NE on on the sord when

86
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
the go through my NE on on the sord when
 

87
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,589
the go through my NE on on the sord when
he slides back now he moves his body not

88
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:44,599
he slides back now he moves his body not
 

89
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,949
he slides back now he moves his body not
just his arm G this needs to be

90
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
just his arm G this needs to be
 

91
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,390
just his arm G this needs to be
controlled releases

92
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400

but it might be a big slide back and you

96
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
but it might be a big slide back and you
 

97
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,229
but it might be a big slide back and you
get this problem so it means in this
