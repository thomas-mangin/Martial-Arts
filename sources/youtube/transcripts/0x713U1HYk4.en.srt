he's going

20
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
he's going
 

21
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,709
he's going
so if you let's look at what what i did

22
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
so if you let's look at what what i did
 

23
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,389
so if you let's look at what what i did
there

did
okay so there's a pressure and there's a

30
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
okay so there's a pressure and there's a
 

31
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,910

so if you watch we'll watch one hand at

42
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
so if you watch we'll watch one hand at
 

43
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,470
so if you watch we'll watch one hand at
a time

44
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
a time
 

45
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,150
a time
okay uh i just let it go past me

46
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160

 

47
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,630

and you watch the other one it's i'm

48
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
and you watch the other one it's i'm
 

49
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,070
and you watch the other one it's i'm
gonna move it out

50
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
gonna move it out
 

51
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,710
