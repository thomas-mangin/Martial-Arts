so his energy is going forward that's

270
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:26,099
so his energy is going forward that's
 

271
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,730
so his energy is going forward that's
not only when I'm gonna drop him

but that is when the choke starts so
 

275
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,370
but that is when the choke starts so
that he doesn't have his

276
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,380
that he doesn't have his
 

277
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,370

pulling that arm off of me and I'm here
like this he'll pull it and he'll get an

340
00:08:59,690 --> 00:08:59,700
like this he'll pull it and he'll get an
 

341
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,550
like this he'll pull it and he'll get an
arm break on this arm over here well

342
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:01,560
arm break on this arm over here well
 

343
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,110
arm break on this arm over here well
don't do it

344
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
don't do it
 

345
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,690
don't do it
he'll definitely get out but this is

346
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:05,700
he'll definitely get out but this is
 

347
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,870
he'll definitely get out but this is
anchoring can you see so he pulls it and

348
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
anchoring can you see so he pulls it and
 

349
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,030
anchoring can you see so he pulls it and
he's gone I'm hanging him I'm hanging

350
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
he's gone I'm hanging him I'm hanging
 

351
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,210
he's gone I'm hanging him I'm hanging
him it's too late okay so that forearm

352
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,220
him it's too late okay so that forearm
 

353
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,870
him it's too late okay so that forearm
is acting as a resistance to his pulling

354
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:17,880
is acting as a resistance to his pulling
 

355
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,889
is acting as a resistance to his pulling
and then the last point

356
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:21,899

 

357
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,690

again

358
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:23,700
again
 

359
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,870
again
it's it's his energy

360
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
it's it's his energy
 

361
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,410
it's it's his energy
uh I don't want it to come backwards

362
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:30,420
uh I don't want it to come backwards
 

363
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,210
uh I don't want it to come backwards
into me so that he accelerates me back

364
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:34,220
into me so that he accelerates me back
 

365
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,250
into me so that he accelerates me back
backwards okay so I don't want to walk

366
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,260
backwards okay so I don't want to walk
 

367
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,710
backwards okay so I don't want to walk
him back because he'll accelerate

368
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:41,720
him back because he'll accelerate
 

369
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,430
him back because he'll accelerate
scrambling again

370
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440

 

371
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,490

hence you want to do it while he's gone

372
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:52,500
hence you want to do it while he's gone
 

373
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,570
hence you want to do it while he's gone
forward

374
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:53,580
forward
 

375
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,310
forward
but

376
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
but
 

377
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,030
but
my my ground vectoring is stopping him

378
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
my my ground vectoring is stopping him
 

379
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,389
my my ground vectoring is stopping him
just like he's pushing here he can't

380
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
just like he's pushing here he can't
 

381
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,610
just like he's pushing here he can't
push me he's never he's never going to

382
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:04,620
push me he's never he's never going to
 

383
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,630
push me he's never he's never going to
push me

384
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
push me
 

385
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,389
push me
so the same thing here as we're going

386
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
so the same thing here as we're going
 

387
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,290
so the same thing here as we're going
back down he drives by he's not going to

388
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,300
back down he drives by he's not going to
 

389
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,329
back down he drives by he's not going to
drive me back he's not going to drive me

390
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:14,339
drive me back he's not going to drive me
 

391
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,780
drive me back he's not going to drive me
back he's not going to drive me back

392
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:16,790
back he's not going to drive me back
 

393
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,230
back he's not going to drive me back

you see it's still ground Factory okay

396
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:22,740
you see it's still ground Factory okay
 

397
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,769
you see it's still ground Factory okay
um and like I said if for some reason

398
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:27,779
um and like I said if for some reason
 

399
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,650
um and like I said if for some reason
maybe you're on

400
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:30,660
maybe you're on
 

401
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,710
maybe you're on
you got brand new leather soles and

402
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:33,720
you got brand new leather soles and
 

403
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,070
you got brand new leather soles and
you're on some slick carpet okay and you

404
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,080
you're on some slick carpet okay and you
 

405
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,050
you're on some slick carpet okay and you
can tell you're going backwards that's

406
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,060
can tell you're going backwards that's
 

407
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,210
can tell you're going backwards that's
where you dish him because you don't

408
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,220
where you dish him because you don't
 

409
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,990
where you dish him because you don't
want a graph like that guys

410
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,000

 

411
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,210

okay all right

412
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,220
okay all right
 

413
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,000
okay all right
try to bring that
