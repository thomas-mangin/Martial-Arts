3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,629

you have to pay attention

4
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:13,639
you have to pay attention
 

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,670
you have to pay attention
more um you're being played by the same

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
more um you're being played by the same
 

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,230
more um you're being played by the same
problem like you're painting the picture

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
problem like you're painting the picture
 

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,029
problem like you're painting the picture
that you think you're seeing okay I

10
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
that you think you're seeing okay I
 

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,429
that you think you're seeing okay I
think if

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:26,439
think if
 

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,749
think if
you slow down the video really you study

14
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:30,759
you slow down the video really you study
 

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,590
you slow down the video really you study
it you would see I'm not doing what you

16
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
it you would see I'm not doing what you
 

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,110
it you would see I'm not doing what you
think I'm doing

18
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,120
think I'm doing
 

19
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,990
think I'm doing
okay

20
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,000
okay
 

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,190
okay
um let's go back to some things so I I

22
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,200
um let's go back to some things so I I
 

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,670
um let's go back to some things so I I
only have two movements that's all I

24
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:44,680
only have two movements that's all I
 

25
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,709
only have two movements that's all I
have and those movements are very

26
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
have and those movements are very
 

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,270
have and those movements are very
important

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,280
important
 

29
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,990
important
because internally it's the loudong

30
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,000
because internally it's the loudong
 

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,670
because internally it's the loudong
that's turning and spiral rotating the

32
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:54,680
that's turning and spiral rotating the
 

33
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,349
that's turning and spiral rotating the
Tom Den which is

34
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:57,359
Tom Den which is
 

35
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,590
Tom Den which is
the undoing so to speak

36
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
the undoing so to speak
 

37
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,990
the undoing so to speak
of the yinong aspects okay you have to

38
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
of the yinong aspects okay you have to
 

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,910
of the yinong aspects okay you have to
spiral rotate to undo the

40
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
spiral rotate to undo the
 

41
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,830
spiral rotate to undo the
dichotomy

42
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
dichotomy
 

43
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,990
dichotomy
so with that in mind let me remind you

44
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
so with that in mind let me remind you
 

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,310
so with that in mind let me remind you
that things that are Yin will pass

46
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
that things that are Yin will pass
 

47
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,510
that things that are Yin will pass
through the yin phase into the Y phase

48
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
through the yin phase into the Y phase
 

49
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,630
through the yin phase into the Y phase
and vice versa do not expect something

50
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:25,640
and vice versa do not expect something
 

51
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,550
and vice versa do not expect something
to

52
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
to
 

53
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,390
to
stay uh in a permanent young phase or a

54
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
stay uh in a permanent young phase or a
 

55
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,109
stay uh in a permanent young phase or a
permanent Yin phase that's not

56
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
permanent Yin phase that's not
 

57
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,310
permanent Yin phase that's not
correct and most likely you're doing a

58
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
correct and most likely you're doing a
 

59
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,109
correct and most likely you're doing a
permanent y phase because that's the

60
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
permanent y phase because that's the
 

61
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,429
permanent y phase because that's the
fear phase okay and that is contesting

62
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
fear phase okay and that is contesting
 

63
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,990
fear phase okay and that is contesting
and more dichotomy and it's going to

64
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
and more dichotomy and it's going to
 

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,270
and more dichotomy and it's going to
make sense to you so so uh you're he's

66
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
make sense to you so so uh you're he's
 

67
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,990
make sense to you so so uh you're he's
he's driving you see and you're like

68
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,000
he's driving you see and you're like
 

69
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,310
he's driving you see and you're like
this you see that see that I'm not

70
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
this you see that see that I'm not
 

71
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,029
this you see that see that I'm not
letting them in okay and then you over

72
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,039
letting them in okay and then you over
 

73
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,109
letting them in okay and then you over
here and then you're like that and

74
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119
here and then you're like that and
 

75
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,670
here and then you're like that and
you're not letting him in do you guys

76
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:02,680
you're not letting him in do you guys
 

77
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,270
you're not letting him in do you guys
understand that you guys see that okay

78
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
understand that you guys see that okay
 

79
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,309
understand that you guys see that okay
but this shape this shape what shape is

80
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
but this shape this shape what shape is
 

81
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,869
but this shape this shape what shape is
that that's no shape that's no shape

82
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
that that's no shape that's no shape
 

83
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,670
that that's no shape that's no shape
either that shape's not in the arm okay

84
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
either that shape's not in the arm okay
 

85
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,670
either that shape's not in the arm okay
and then you come

86
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
and then you come
 

87
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,470
and then you come
around and then you're on this

88
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
around and then you're on this
 

89
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,229
around and then you're on this
arm and you're doing this do you see and

90
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:23,239
arm and you're doing this do you see and
 

91
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,150
arm and you're doing this do you see and
again this shape's not in the

92
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
again this shape's not in the
 

93
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,630
again this shape's not in the
AR then you're over here so you're over

94
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
AR then you're over here so you're over
 

95
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,910
AR then you're over here so you're over
here and you're going like this a lot of

96
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
here and you're going like this a lot of
 

97
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,750
here and you're going like this a lot of
people go like this they want to Anchor

98
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
people go like this they want to Anchor
 

99
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,350
people go like this they want to Anchor
the elbow and they go like

100
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360
the elbow and they go like
 

101
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,509
the elbow and they go like
this but that shapes not in the

102
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:40,519

 

103
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,949

art here

104
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:43,959

 

105
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,710

here two

106
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
here two
 

107
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,070
here two
circles this shape's not in the

108
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080

 

109
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,990

AR then you go here that shape's not in

110
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,000
AR then you go here that shape's not in
 

111
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,509
AR then you go here that shape's not in
the ark you see this shape's not in the

112
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
the ark you see this shape's not in the
 

113
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,430
the ark you see this shape's not in the
art you right so

114
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
art you right so
 

115
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,350
art you right so
instead

155
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,270

outside here this does everything that

156
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
outside here this does everything that
 

157
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,629
outside here this does everything that
they're trying to do

158
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639

 

159

together why together because
eventually this

166
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
eventually this
 

167
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,230
eventually this
arm is going to pass through

168
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,240

 

169
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,029

it's going to it's right here I have a

170
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
it's going to it's right here I have a
 

171
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,430
it's going to it's right here I have a
lot of energy then it starts to go down

172
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,440
lot of energy then it starts to go down
 

173
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,950
lot of energy then it starts to go down
so lot of Y goes through Yin and this is

174
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:09,960
so lot of Y goes through Yin and this is
 

175
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:21,749
so lot of Y goes through Yin and this is
where this picks up the

176
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759

 

177
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,629

Y okay try it

178
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639

 

179
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:58,629

again

180
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639

 

181
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:28,550

e

182
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560

 

183
00:06:28,560 --> 00:07:04,230

e e

184
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240

 

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,790

you're doing that uh last little

186
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
you're doing that uh last little
 

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,790
you're doing that uh last little
spiral you're going you're doing

188
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:11,800

 

189
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,469

this you see that he okay watch your

190
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
this you see that he okay watch your
 

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,629
this you see that he okay watch your
Center feel your Center feel your spine

192
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639

 

193
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,390

okay do it again just relax you don't

194
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
okay do it again just relax you don't
 

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:37,670
okay do it again just relax you don't
need to do anything just feel it

196
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680

 

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,670

watch so it's kind of going around your

198
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,680
watch so it's kind of going around your
 

199
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,390
watch so it's kind of going around your
spine you're kind of going like this pay

200
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,400

 

201
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,110

attention watch watch your body now

202
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,120
attention watch watch your body now
 

203
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,629
attention watch watch your body now
which way is it going it's going this

204
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
which way is it going it's going this
 

205
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,390
which way is it going it's going this
way pay

206
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400

 

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,909

attention other one other one

208
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:00,919
attention other one other one
 

209
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:08,430
attention other one other one
there's no energy this way pay

210
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:08,440

 

211
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,510

attention you see you feel it I'll just

212
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:12,520
attention you see you feel it I'll just
 

213
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,710
attention you see you feel it I'll just
do that

214
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,720
do that
 

215
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,670
do that
energy you feel it on your left now okay

216
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:16,680
energy you feel it on your left now okay
 

217
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,950
energy you feel it on your left now okay
so two dimensional

218
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960

 

219
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,629

Circle threedimensional

220
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:25,639

 

221
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,189

spiral watch where you fall now okay

222
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
spiral watch where you fall now okay
 

223
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:40,589
spiral watch where you fall now okay
watch where you're fall in relation to

224
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:40,599

 

225
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,550

me that not over here over here is

226
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
me that not over here over here is
 

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,750
me that not over here over here is
because there is another dimension of

228
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
because there is another dimension of
 

229
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,350
because there is another dimension of
force traveling up your spine

230
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360

 

231
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,710

okay so it I don't even think it looks

232
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
okay so it I don't even think it looks
 

233
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,550
okay so it I don't even think it looks
to save myself

234
00:08:59,550 --> 00:08:59,560
to save myself
 

235
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,509
to save myself
like this looks totally different to

236
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
like this looks totally different to
 

237
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,110
like this looks totally different to
me this one is this

238
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
me this one is this
 

239
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,110
me this one is this
way you

240
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
way you
 

241
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,630
way you
see but you can see that he's not

242
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
see but you can see that he's not
 

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,269
see but you can see that he's not
falling over there he's going around

244
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:16,279
falling over there he's going around
 

245
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:26,550
falling over there he's going around
around

246
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560

 

247
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,030

me this way so now let's watch what that

248
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,040
me this way so now let's watch what that
 

249
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,790
me this way so now let's watch what that
does to this

250
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:33,800

 

251
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,230

hand if I throw him out

252
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240

 

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,710

there my hands out

254
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:43,720
there my hands out
 

255
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,190
there my hands out
there so I have to like go

256
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,200

 

257
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,949

him whereas on this

258
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:51,959
him whereas on this
 

259
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,710
him whereas on this
one you

260
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:53,720
one you
 

261
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,310
one you
see you can bring him into

262
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:57,320
see you can bring him into
 

263
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,470
see you can bring him into
it's now virging your long face

264
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:01,480
it's now virging your long face
 

265
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,790
it's now virging your long face
again very similar to when we do

266
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:05,800
again very similar to when we do
 

267
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:51,990
again very similar to when we do
this you see got it okay so try it again

268
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000

 

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,350

the internals like we because we're

270
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,360
the internals like we because we're
 

271
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,430
the internals like we because we're
learning them they are

272
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
learning them they are
 

273
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,870
learning them they are
um um very St

274
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
um um very St
 

275
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,829
um um very St
and and very linear right like we're

276
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:02,839
and and very linear right like we're
 

277
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,150
and and very linear right like we're
here okay and we're doing those kind of

278
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,160
here okay and we're doing those kind of
 

279
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,069
here okay and we're doing those kind of
things correct okay

280
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:09,079
things correct okay
 

281
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,430
things correct okay
um but

282
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
um but
 

283
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,790
um but
our architectures are not like that so

284
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:15,800
our architectures are not like that so
 

285
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,790
our architectures are not like that so
our keona for

286
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:17,800
our keona for
 

287
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,629
our keona for
example um

288
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:20,639
example um
 

289
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,069
example um
and you have to remember that those are

290
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:23,079
and you have to remember that those are
 

291
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,269
and you have to remember that those are
just beginner progressions and anytime

292
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
just beginner progressions and anytime
 

293
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,030
just beginner progressions and anytime
you have a beginner progression in some

294
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
you have a beginner progression in some
 

295
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,509
you have a beginner progression in some
way they're not right in some way are

296
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
way they're not right in some way are
 

297
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,910
way they're not right in some way are
wrong okay it's just by default so like

298
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:32,920
wrong okay it's just by default so like
 

299
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,190
wrong okay it's just by default so like
for

300
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,200
for
 

301
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,110
for
example

302
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
example
 

303
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,150
example
um we might practice and we have right

304
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,160
um we might practice and we have right
 

305
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,670
um we might practice and we have right
our draw stroke from concealment we and

306
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
our draw stroke from concealment we and
 

307
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,790
our draw stroke from concealment we and
we want to see how fast it go how fast

308
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:43,800
we want to see how fast it go how fast
 

309
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,350
we want to see how fast it go how fast
you get it out right but that's not the

310
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,360
you get it out right but that's not the
 

311
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,710
you get it out right but that's not the
way we actually fight with

312
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
way we actually fight with
 

313
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,990
way we actually fight with
concealment um to fight with concealment

314
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
concealment um to fight with concealment
 

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,590
concealment um to fight with concealment
is not to try to hurry up and beat that

316
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:54,600
is not to try to hurry up and beat that
 

317
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,389
is not to try to hurry up and beat that
guy but to take advantage of the fact

318
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:57,399
guy but to take advantage of the fact
 

319
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,470
guy but to take advantage of the fact
that they don't know your arm so instead

320
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
that they don't know your arm so instead
 

321
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,069
that they don't know your arm so instead
you look for distraction and for a lull

322
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
you look for distraction and for a lull
 

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,110
you look for distraction and for a lull
right and that might require that you do

324
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,120
right and that might require that you do
 

325
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,870
right and that might require that you do
it like this

326
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,880
it like this
 

327
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,230
it like this
as do you see that so some guy actually

328
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,240
as do you see that so some guy actually
 

329
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,389
as do you see that so some guy actually
did the stats on it he like looked at a

330
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:13,399
did the stats on it he like looked at a
 

331
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,150
did the stats on it he like looked at a
bunch of gunfights and overwhelmingly

332
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
bunch of gunfights and overwhelmingly
 

333
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,150
bunch of gunfights and overwhelmingly
the successful ones were not on The Fast

334
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,160
the successful ones were not on The Fast
 

335
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,470
the successful ones were not on The Fast
Draw but on a stealthy draw okay so the

336
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
Draw but on a stealthy draw okay so the
 

337
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,030
Draw but on a stealthy draw okay so the
beginner of working on mechanics and and

338
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
beginner of working on mechanics and and
 

339
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,030
beginner of working on mechanics and and
putting it on the clock and see how well

340
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
putting it on the clock and see how well
 

341
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,310
putting it on the clock and see how well
it can work right when you're facing and

342
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,320
it can work right when you're facing and
 

343
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,389
it can work right when you're facing and
the target it's not the way you actually

344
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:31,399
the target it's not the way you actually
 

345

well it's trying to go that way do you

490
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:04,199
well it's trying to go that way do you
 

491
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,949
well it's trying to go that way do you
see and as I take it into the turn it's

492
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
see and as I take it into the turn it's
 

493
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,430
see and as I take it into the turn it's
still trying to go outward from the turn

494
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,440
still trying to go outward from the turn
 

495

still trying to go outward from the turn
but if I take it at a 90 to that and

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:14,600
but if I take it at a 90 to that and
 

497
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,150
but if I take it at a 90 to that and
when it's still it's very very hard to

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
when it's still it's very very hard to
 

499
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,069
when it's still it's very very hard to
adhere but once it wants to go out then

501
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,749

I can keep taking it out and I can get

that's you're doing that in all of this

506
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
that's you're doing that in all of this
 

507
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,749
that's you're doing that in all of this
technique

508
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
technique
 

509
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,269
technique
the whole technique the whole technique

510
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:32,279
the whole technique the whole technique
 

511
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,910
the whole technique the whole technique
is doing that it's using the centrifugal

512
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:34,920
is doing that it's using the centrifugal
 

513
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,110
is doing that it's using the centrifugal
energy to get the Y to

514
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
energy to get the Y to
 

515
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,870
energy to get the Y to
go to whether I project or whether I

516
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:41,880
go to whether I project or whether I
 

517
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,309
go to whether I project or whether I
adhere on it that means if I stop the UK

518
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:47,319
adhere on it that means if I stop the UK
 

519
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,670
adhere on it that means if I stop the UK
the centrifugal energy that you see me

520
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
the centrifugal energy that you see me
 

521
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,189
the centrifugal energy that you see me
using if you stop the UK it's not going

522
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:52,199
using if you stop the UK it's not going
 

523
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,150
using if you stop the UK it's not going
to be there and you have to do those

524
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
to be there and you have to do those
 

525
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,990
to be there and you have to do those
two-dimensional hooks all that kind of

526
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,000
two-dimensional hooks all that kind of
 

527
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,150
two-dimensional hooks all that kind of
stuff

528
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,160
stuff
 

529
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,590
stuff
here St the energy you got to go like

530
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:02,600
here St the energy you got to go like
 

531
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,829
here St the energy you got to go like
this you got to go like this right you

532
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:04,839
this you got to go like this right you
 

533
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,829
this you got to go like this right you
got to go like this you have to do

534
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:06,839
got to go like this you have to do
 

535
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,909
got to go like this you have to do
things to turn

536
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
things to turn
 

537
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,390
things to turn
him whereas if you keep him

538
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400

 

539
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,110

moving get stuck on there as long as

540
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
moving get stuck on there as long as
 

541
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,309
moving get stuck on there as long as
you're

542
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
you're
 

543
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,230
you're
doing

544
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
doing
 

545
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,230
doing
that uh 90° fluctuation to it okay so

546
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,240
that uh 90° fluctuation to it okay so
 

547
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,510
that uh 90° fluctuation to it okay so
try to keep them moving and try to feel

548
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
try to keep them moving and try to feel
 

549
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,630
try to keep them moving and try to feel
exactly what you feel when we're working

550
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:29,640
exactly what you feel when we're working
 

551
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,350
exactly what you feel when we're working
in

552
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,360
in
 

553
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:44,150
in
two-dimensional environments

554
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160

 

555
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,510

okay the point that Taylor got okay so

556
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
okay the point that Taylor got okay so
 

557
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,630
okay the point that Taylor got okay so
when you're coming

558
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,640

 

559
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,750

around okay this hand is going to go

560
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
around okay this hand is going to go
 

561
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,350
around okay this hand is going to go
into its Yin face

562
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
into its Yin face
 

563
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,029
into its Yin face
around

564
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
around
 

565
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,029
around
here a lot of people want to use this

566
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
here a lot of people want to use this
 

567
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,789
here a lot of people want to use this
shoulder power you you get the shoulder

568
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:07,799
shoulder power you you get the shoulder
 

569
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,669
shoulder power you you get the shoulder
and you go like that I used to do that

570
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
and you go like that I used to do that
 

571
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,029
and you go like that I used to do that
okay because you feel really powerful

572
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:12,039
okay because you feel really powerful
 

573
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,029
okay because you feel really powerful
because this never feels powerful

574
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:14,039
because this never feels powerful
 

575
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,830
because this never feels powerful
because you can tell your inner deltoid

576
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
because you can tell your inner deltoid
 

577
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,230
because you can tell your inner deltoid
is is [\h__\h] it up right so you put him

578
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
is is [\h__\h] it up right so you put him
 

579
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,149
is is [\h__\h] it up right so you put him
like right here and you're like you use

580
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:21,159
like right here and you're like you use
 

581
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,590
like right here and you're like you use
that but he I can't do I can't throw him

582
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
that but he I can't do I can't throw him
 

583
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,230
that but he I can't do I can't throw him
don't let me throw you

584
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
don't let me throw you
 

585
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,990
don't let me throw you
can't there's no freaking way okay

586
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
can't there's no freaking way okay
 

587
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,029
can't there's no freaking way okay
so this this hand this hand does it this

588
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,039
so this this hand this hand does it this
 

589
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,149
so this this hand this hand does it this
hand does it and does it in the motion

590
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,159
hand does it and does it in the motion
 

591
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,070
hand does it and does it in the motion
so the motion is going and then this

592
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
so the motion is going and then this
 

593
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,230
so the motion is going and then this
hand's doing it okay and then you follow

594
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,240
hand's doing it okay and then you follow
 

595
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,230
hand's doing it okay and then you follow
the

596
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
the
 

597
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,549
the
rules so let's start again the rules are

598
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
rules so let's start again the rules are
 

599
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,990
rules so let's start again the rules are
that the hands transfer

600
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
that the hands transfer
 

601
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,590
that the hands transfer
responsibilities as they reach that wui

602
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
responsibilities as they reach that wui
 

603
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,549
responsibilities as they reach that wui
wuji line here's where it goes you see

604
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559
wuji line here's where it goes you see
 

605
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,549
wuji line here's where it goes you see
not not

606
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:03,559
not not
 

607
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,470
not not
before but

608
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:05,480
before but
 

609
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,430
before but
definitely not

610
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
definitely not
 

611
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,350
definitely not
after okay so you're always working in

612
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
after okay so you're always working in
 

613
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,110
after okay so you're always working in
here

614
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,120
here
 

615
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,430
here
boom boom here it

616
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:16,440
boom boom here it
 

617
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,430
boom boom here it
is piix it up there

618
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
is piix it up there
 

619
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,070
is piix it up there
okay try to remember that don't have it

620
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
okay try to remember that don't have it
 

621
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,230
okay try to remember that don't have it
before trying to use your chest here and

622
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,240
before trying to use your chest here and
 

623
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,149
before trying to use your chest here and
but definitely you shouldn't be throwing

624
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:27,159
but definitely you shouldn't be throwing
 

625
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,070
but definitely you shouldn't be throwing
them and then your arms hit in air or

626
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,080
them and then your arms hit in air or
 

627
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,390
them and then your arms hit in air or
it's not even needed okay all right try

628
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,400
it's not even needed okay all right try
 

629
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,510
it's not even needed okay all right try
to you're trying to use this centrifical

630
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
to you're trying to use this centrifical
 

631
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,430
to you're trying to use this centrifical
energy to generate your

632
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
energy to generate your
 

633
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,070
energy to generate your
adhesions uh as you're going

634
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,080
adhesions uh as you're going
 

635
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,909
adhesions uh as you're going
around he is not going to go from

636
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
around he is not going to go from
 

637
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,270
around he is not going to go from
here into the

638
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,280
here into the
 

639
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,549
here into the
throat that's not what he's going to

640
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:49,559
throat that's not what he's going to
 

641
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,110
throat that's not what he's going to
do so I can't stay

642
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,120
do so I can't stay
 

643
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,909
do so I can't stay
here and throw him this way

644
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919

 

645
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,830

also this is a reactionary throw so as

646
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:02,840
also this is a reactionary throw so as
 

647
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,789
also this is a reactionary throw so as
he gets up it's not that I'm gonna go

648
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:05,799
he gets up it's not that I'm gonna go
 

649
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,789
he gets up it's not that I'm gonna go
like that because you you will give him

650
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:07,799
like that because you you will give him
 

651
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,350
like that because you you will give him
back his balance when he goes up that's

652
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
back his balance when he goes up that's
 

653
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,230
back his balance when he goes up that's
what you're taking this way you see

654
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,240
what you're taking this way you see
 

655
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,070
what you're taking this way you see
so uh I you I generally move around as

656
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
so uh I you I generally move around as
 

657
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,430
so uh I you I generally move around as
he goes up into

658
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:26,440

 

659
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,190

this so if you pay attention it's very

660
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
this so if you pay attention it's very
 

661
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,430
this so if you pay attention it's very
much like

662
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:30,440
much like
 

663
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,669
much like
K so as he gets up I am on one side of

664
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:34,679
K so as he gets up I am on one side of
 

665
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,909
K so as he gets up I am on one side of
his body and then I'm moving to the

666
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:36,919
his body and then I'm moving to the
 

667
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,110
his body and then I'm moving to the
other side of his body over here okay

668
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,120
other side of his body over here okay
 

669
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,789
other side of his body over here okay

688
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:10,600
that the centrifical energy generates so
 

689
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,149
that the centrifical energy generates so
that you can use

690
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
