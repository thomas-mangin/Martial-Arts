so you see how we
 

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,830
so you see how we
match there you see so already there is

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,790
down and and i catch his weapon his
weapon goes up and i catch his weapon

350
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
weapon goes up and i catch his weapon
 

351
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,790
weapon goes up and i catch his weapon
okay so you need that

352
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
okay so you need that
 

353
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,990
okay so you need that
timing

354
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
timing
 

355
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,470
timing
my sword goes up his sword goes up with

356
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
my sword goes up his sword goes up with
 

357
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,030
my sword goes up his sword goes up with
mine and then fills that void from the

358
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
mine and then fills that void from the
 

359
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,949
mine and then fills that void from the
in space but

360
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
in space but
 

361
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,870
in space but
it's my strategy

362
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
it's my strategy
 

363
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,509
it's my strategy
to give him that opening okay

364
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519

 

365
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,509

um

366
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
um
 

367
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,430
um
so here's the thing

368
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440

 

369
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,949

my is time space yes

370
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
my is time space yes
 

371
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,389
my is time space yes
yes my is time space but the application

372
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
yes my is time space but the application
 

373
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,750
yes my is time space but the application
of my

374
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
of my
 

375
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,630

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
is not an intellectual understanding of
 

377
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,470
is not an intellectual understanding of
time space okay

378
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
time space okay
 

379
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,030
time space okay
it is a

380
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
it is a
 

381
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,670
it is a
a much deeper intuitive level

382
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
a much deeper intuitive level
 

383
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,470
a much deeper intuitive level
of

of
 

385
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,269
of
time space okay so at the beginning

386
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
time space okay so at the beginning
 

387
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,660
time space okay so at the beginning
when we're here

388
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:48,670
when we're here

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,470
this divine communion here
is what is allowing for the adhesion

452
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
is what is allowing for the adhesion

have you released have you released have

472
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
have you released have you released have
 

473

you released

474
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
you released
 

475
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,790
you released
do you get it and then

476
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
do you get it and then
 

477
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,389
do you get it and then
all that will happen

478
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
all that will happen
 

479
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,550
all that will happen
is once our swords touch you'll feel the

480
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
is once our swords touch you'll feel the
 

481
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,990
is once our swords touch you'll feel the
friction

482
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
friction
 

483
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,670
friction
and you take it off

484
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
and you take it off
 

485
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,550
and you take it off
okay

486
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
okay
 

487
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,430
okay
but

488
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
but
 

489
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,269
but
you still have the other one the

490
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
you still have the other one the
 

491
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,629
you still have the other one the
non-tactile connection okay

492
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
non-tactile connection okay
 

493
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,069
non-tactile connection okay
because when we go full speed

494
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
because when we go full speed
 

495
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,750
because when we go full speed
you're not touching anything

496
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
you're not touching anything
 

497
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,230
you're not touching anything
it's all this other non-tactile like

498
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
it's all this other non-tactile like
 

499
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,350
it's all this other non-tactile like
okay

500
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
okay
 

501
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,590
okay
so you must prove release this is not

502
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600

 

503
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,389

you see this i'm never gonna do it

504
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
you see this i'm never gonna do it
 

505
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,430
you see this i'm never gonna do it
i'm terrified my body is terrified okay

506
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
