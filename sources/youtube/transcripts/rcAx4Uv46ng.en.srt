00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,480
he's moving forward so he goes like this

298
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,490
and that's what happens you see that
 

299
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,660
and that's what happens you see that
so that's entirely different from from

so that's entirely different from from
 

301
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,050

this happen you guys see that difference

302
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,060
this happen you guys see that difference
 

303
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,570
this happen you guys see that difference
okay so you know if you take the classic

304
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:42,580
okay so you know if you take the classic
 

305
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,970
okay so you know if you take the classic
form where I use his energy against and

306
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:44,980
form where I use his energy against and
 

307
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,950
form where I use his energy against and
well this is not using his energy

308
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:46,960
well this is not using his energy
 

309
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,580
well this is not using his energy
against him

310
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:49,590
against him
 

311
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,770
against him
so here we made a very gross energy

312
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:52,780
so here we made a very gross energy
 

313
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,380
so here we made a very gross energy
which witness push so he hits it and

314
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:55,390
which witness push so he hits it and
 

315
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,020
which witness push so he hits it and
then he goes do you guys see that so you

316
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,030
then he goes do you guys see that so you
 

317
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,660
then he goes do you guys see that so you
have to really resist the temptation to

318
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:00,670
have to really resist the temptation to
 

319
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,130
have to really resist the temptation to
do a kind of anatomical geometry that

320
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,140
do a kind of anatomical geometry that
 

321
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,010
do a kind of anatomical geometry that
has its place but not in this drill okay

322
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,020
has its place but not in this drill okay
 

323
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,880
has its place but not in this drill okay
and so if I if I stalemate him here and

324
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:11,890
and so if I if I stalemate him here and
 

325
