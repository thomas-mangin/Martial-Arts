is here in space and two objects cannot

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
is here in space and two objects cannot
 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,230
is here in space and two objects cannot
occupy the same space and that's what

16
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,240
occupy the same space and that's what
 

17
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,630
occupy the same space and that's what
makes it move okay and then then he does

18
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:31,640
makes it move okay and then then he does
 

19
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,150
makes it move okay and then then he does
the Uki he's trying to free his weapon

20
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,160
the Uki he's trying to free his weapon
 

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,430
the Uki he's trying to free his weapon
okay so I'll show you the two

22
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
okay so I'll show you the two
 

23
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,470
okay so I'll show you the two
differences as I come around here I'm

24
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
differences as I come around here I'm
 

25
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,750
differences as I come around here I'm
going to paint the picture I'm moving it

26
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:42,760
going to paint the picture I'm moving it
 

27
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,869
going to paint the picture I'm moving it
over there even if I touch his subba and

28
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
over there even if I touch his subba and
 

29
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,950
over there even if I touch his subba and
I move it over there this is

30
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
I move it over there this is
 

31
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,950
I move it over there this is
incorrect one two I moved it over there

32
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
incorrect one two I moved it over there
 

33
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,950
incorrect one two I moved it over there
you can see where my tip of my Joe is

34
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:55,960
you can see where my tip of my Joe is
 

35
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,630
you can see where my tip of my Joe is
over here

36
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:57,640
over here
 

37
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,349
over here
C this is not the center line so the

38
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:00,359
C this is not the center line so the
 

39
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,630
C this is not the center line so the
center line is here that I must protect

40
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
center line is here that I must protect
 

41
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,950
center line is here that I must protect
okay so yes it's deflected over there

42
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:07,960
okay so yes it's deflected over there
