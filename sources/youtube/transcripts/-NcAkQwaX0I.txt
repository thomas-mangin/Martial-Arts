oh
is you're not Dynamic enough you can't
move everywhere that that's why we're
doing this these drills because your IO
allows you to do stupid things like that
which is why you're in those gopy
stances where where I don't stand in
okay so as I'm going here I can go
forward you press this I can go
backwards I can raise my foot I can
raise the other foot from the first
initial stance got it so instead of
falling on that foot and bracing
here even if it looks like my leg is
more weight on here I'm not pinned okay
so I can go back
here so don't fall on
here fight the
fight
stay
[Music]
Dynamic okay let's go
