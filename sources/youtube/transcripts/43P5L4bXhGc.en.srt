167
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,590
pharaohs would shove [\h__\h] in the tombs
want to live for

168
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600

 

169
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,870

forever so there is no there's no why to

170
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
forever so there is no there's no why to
 

171
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,230
forever so there is no there's no why to
this there's no

172
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
this there's no
 

173
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,749
this there's no
why and once you realize that I think

174
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:52,759
why and once you realize that I think
 

175
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,990
why and once you realize that I think
you're

176
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,000
you're
 

177
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,430
you're
free of someone else's fear of

178
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,440
free of someone else's fear of
 

179
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,590
free of someone else's fear of
death and and you should play with it so

180
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
death and and you should play with it so
 

181
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,469
death and and you should play with it so
it makes

182
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:03,479
it makes
 

183
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,870
it makes
sense now the reasoning that I got on

184
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:07,880
sense now the reasoning that I got on
 

185
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,990
sense now the reasoning that I got on
the

do Shon nag it's just not true there's
 

193
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,270
do Shon nag it's just not true there's
an infinite amount of ways that you can

an infinite amount of ways that you can

197
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,390

Naga but I think it's

198
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400

 

199
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,629

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,120
pivoting that means no rotation of the
 

211
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,950
pivoting that means no rotation of the

00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
feet that means you have to have a
 

217
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,950
feet that means you have to have a
ground vector and most importantly on

218

ground vector and most importantly on
 

219
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,629
ground vector and most importantly on
because there's so much rotation in

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,189
because there's so much rotation in
here that you have to to know how to get

235
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,550

times so let's just kind of experiment a

236
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,560
times so let's just kind of experiment a
 

237
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,790
times so let's just kind of experiment a
little bit as I make this this point to

238
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
little bit as I make this this point to
 

239
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,950
little bit as I make this this point to
identify where's the single Pivot Point

240
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
identify where's the single Pivot Point
 

241
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,110
identify where's the single Pivot Point
where's the grounding foot

242
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,120
where's the grounding foot
 

243
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,110
where's the grounding foot
how to keep your line of gravity on a

244
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,120
how to keep your line of gravity on a
 

245
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,029
how to keep your line of gravity on a
single pivot point and how to get to the

246
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
single pivot point and how to get to the
 

247
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,990
single pivot point and how to get to the
other side of the Y

248
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
other side of the Y
 

249
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,430
other side of the Y
apex of the articulation degree I'll

250
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
apex of the articulation degree I'll
 

251
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,309
apex of the articulation degree I'll
show you this stuff

252
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:43,319
show you this stuff
 

253
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,270
show you this stuff
okay uh of course we have to always keep

254
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,280
okay uh of course we have to always keep
 

255
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,270
okay uh of course we have to always keep
the harmonies between the joints so

256
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
the harmonies between the joints so
 

257
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,110
the harmonies between the joints so
we're not going to stand in this goofy

258
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
we're not going to stand in this goofy
 

259
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,589
we're not going to stand in this goofy
stance not have our arches cave in not

260
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:54,599
stance not have our arches cave in not
 

261
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,550
stance not have our arches cave in not
torque our knees all that stuff is

262
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
torque our knees all that stuff is
 

263
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,869
torque our knees all that stuff is
[\h__\h] because we're rotating

264
00:06:59,869 --> 00:06:59,879
[\h__\h] because we're rotating
 

265
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,029

uh your yang foot is going to drill down

266
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
uh your yang foot is going to drill down
 

267
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,670
uh your yang foot is going to drill down
on the ball of the foot okay and the yin

268
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
on the ball of the foot okay and the yin
 

269
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,350
on the ball of the foot okay and the yin
foot is pretty much who cares what the

270
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,360
foot is pretty much who cares what the
 

271
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,790
foot is pretty much who cares what the
yin foot is doing it as long as it stays

272
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
yin foot is doing it as long as it stays
 

273
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,670
yin foot is doing it as long as it stays
in the harmonies between the foot the

274
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:14,680
in the harmonies between the foot the
 

275
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,029
in the harmonies between the foot the
knee and the qual so let's get into

276
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
knee and the qual so let's get into
 

277
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,230
knee and the qual so let's get into
this

278
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,240
this
 

279
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,550
this
um more

280
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
um more
 

281
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,990
um more
important than the

282
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
important than the
 

283
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,749
important than the
set is to realize there is a c C

284
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
set is to realize there is a c C
 

285
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,869
set is to realize there is a c C
footwork in there and that footwork is

286
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:32,879
footwork in there and that footwork is
 

287
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,469
footwork in there and that footwork is
universal to all of your

288
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
universal to all of your
 

289
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,029
universal to all of your
Pon but it's not in chiba's lineage it's

290
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:40,039
Pon but it's not in chiba's lineage it's
 

291
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,749
Pon but it's not in chiba's lineage it's
not there if you do it that way you're

292
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:42,759
not there if you do it that way you're
 

293
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,790
not there if you do it that way you're
not going to see the footwork okay but

294
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:45,800
not going to see the footwork okay but
 

295
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,189
not going to see the footwork okay but
the footwork

296
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:48,199
the footwork
 

297
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,189
the footwork
is

298
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:50,199
is
 

299
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,990
is
that you're going to take weight from in

300
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
that you're going to take weight from in
 

301
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,909
that you're going to take weight from in
this case my back

302
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
this case my back
 

303
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,749
this case my back
foot I'm going to e me put weight onto

304
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:00,759
foot I'm going to e me put weight onto
 

305
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,350
foot I'm going to e me put weight onto
the new front foot and then rotate

306
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
the new front foot and then rotate
 

307
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,990
the new front foot and then rotate
drilling down on that ball the

308
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
drilling down on that ball the
 

309
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,029
drilling down on that ball the
foot so I

310
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:12,039
foot so I
 

311
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,869
foot so I
say if you really want the most out of

312
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
say if you really want the most out of
 

313
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,550
say if you really want the most out of
this set you forget the set and you

314
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,560
this set you forget the set and you
 

315
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,909
this set you forget the set and you
would do this footwork instead you have

316
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:20,919
would do this footwork instead you have
 

317
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,070
would do this footwork instead you have
a line that you use at a as a reference

318
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
a line that you use at a as a reference
 

319
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,070
a line that you use at a as a reference
point slide across shift your weight

320
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,080
point slide across shift your weight
 

321
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,589
point slide across shift your weight
onto that foot drill that foot down such

322
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:30,599
onto that foot drill that foot down such
 

323
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,469
onto that foot drill that foot down such
that you pull the Y foot across that

324
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
that you pull the Y foot across that
 

325
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,909
that you pull the Y foot across that
line drop down shift

326
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
line drop down shift
 

327
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,870
line drop down shift
across shift over turn and you pull the

328
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
across shift over turn and you pull the
 

329
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,190
across shift over turn and you pull the
yin foot across the line so again you

330
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
yin foot across the line so again you
 

331

okay my
 

697
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,990
okay my
opinion so uh we've been practicing and

698
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
opinion so uh we've been practicing and
 

699
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,990
opinion so uh we've been practicing and
I don't think what I was saying was as

700
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't think what I was saying was as
 

701

clear I don't just mean

702
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:10,760
clear I don't just mean
 

703
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,190
clear I don't just mean
that the the fight is rotating of course

704
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
that the the fight is rotating of course
 

705
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,470
that the the fight is rotating of course
I mean that but I don't stop rotating in

706
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,480
I mean that but I don't stop rotating in
 

707
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,789
I mean that but I don't stop rotating in
the fight okay and when you have this

708
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
the fight okay and when you have this
 

709
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,830
the fight okay and when you have this
sword form especially when you double

710
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:24,840
sword form especially when you double
 

711
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,270
sword form especially when you double
pivot and you go here you're going to be

712
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,280
pivot and you go here you're going to be
 

713
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,310
pivot and you go here you're going to be
going against the energy of the UK okay

714
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
going against the energy of the UK okay
 

715
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,510
going against the energy of the UK okay
so let's just fake it for a little bit

716
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
so let's just fake it for a little bit
 

717
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,310
so let's just fake it for a little bit
okay so I'm here I come over here and

718
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
okay so I'm here I come over here and
 

719
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,070
okay so I'm here I come over here and
then I go like this right here you are

720
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,080
then I go like this right here you are
 

721
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,110
then I go like this right here you are
fighting the inertia okay and then you

722
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
fighting the inertia okay and then you
 

723
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,230
fighting the inertia okay and then you
have to overpower that to get that to go

724
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,240
have to overpower that to get that to go
 

725
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,110
have to overpower that to get that to go
okay so do that side

726
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
okay so do that side
 

727
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,830
okay so do that side
again here and you would never get here

728
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
again here and you would never get here
 

729
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,669
again here and you would never get here
real but let's say you do and you come

730
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
real but let's say you do and you come
 

731
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,230
real but let's say you do and you come
around here and now you're starting to

732
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
around here and now you're starting to
 

733
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,149
around here and now you're starting to
pull that

734
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
pull that
 

735
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,270
pull that
energy to get it to go here which your

736
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
energy to get it to go here which your
 

737
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,029
energy to get it to go here which your
UK will reconcile by stepping back for

738
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:12,039
UK will reconcile by stepping back for
 

739
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,350
