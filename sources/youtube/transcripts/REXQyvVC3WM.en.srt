00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,040
you do a
 

163
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,909
you do a
forwards and then hasso and back

164
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
forwards and then hasso and back
 

165
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,150
forwards and then hasso and back
forwards strike hasso back and then you

166
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160
forwards strike hasso back and then you
 

167
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,670
forwards strike hasso back and then you
build up once you've done five of those

168
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
build up once you've done five of those
 

169
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,629
build up once you've done five of those
and three felt the same you do strike

170
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
and three felt the same you do strike
 

171
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,350
and three felt the same you do strike
hasso and then you turn with the hasso

172
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
hasso and then you turn with the hasso
 

173
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,350
hasso and then you turn with the hasso
and you strike the opposite

174
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
and you strike the opposite
 

175
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,870
and you strike the opposite
way

176
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
way
 

177
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,110
way
again five of those repetition of trying

178
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,120
again five of those repetition of trying
 

179
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,029
again five of those repetition of trying
to get three feeling the same same as

180
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:49,039
to get three feeling the same same as
 

181
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,629
to get three feeling the same same as
the K and Joe you then move on to four

you get three that felt uh the
 

191
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,909
you get three that felt uh the
repetition feel the same with your feet

192
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
repetition feel the same with your feet
 

193
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,830
repetition feel the same with your feet
as well as your hands your body um if

194
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
as well as your hands your body um if
 

195
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,150
as well as your hands your body um if
you the target is three it's very hard

196
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,160
you the target is three it's very hard
 

197
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,909
you the target is three it's very hard
to get just three um that you can repeat

198
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
to get just three um that you can repeat
 

199
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,629
to get just three um that you can repeat
time and time again and it might take

200
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
time and time again and it might take
 

201
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,909
time and time again and it might take
you years but but set this as a a

I said with the hasso movement once

234
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,160
I said with the hasso movement once
 

235
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,749
I said with the hasso movement once
you've done the S Ken subur with the

236
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:18,759
you've done the S Ken subur with the
 

237
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,830
you've done the S Ken subur with the
Joe I'd like you to move on to the using

238
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
Joe I'd like you to move on to the using
 

239
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,950
Joe I'd like you to move on to the using
the hasso so the hasso with a strike and

240
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:25,960
the hasso so the hasso with a strike and
 

241
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,110
the hasso so the hasso with a strike and
once you've achieved this then you can

242
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,120
once you've achieved this then you can
 

243
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,110
once you've achieved this then you can
start adding to the subur is but add

244
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
start adding to the subur is but add
 

245
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,749
start adding to the subur is but add
them with the hasso so they all start

246
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:32,759
them with the hasso so they all start
 

247
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,189
them with the hasso so they all start
with the hasso and then you can add um

248
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:36,199
with the hasso and then you can add um
 

249
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,350
with the hasso and then you can add um
the forward thrust you're going to add a

250
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,360
the forward thrust you're going to add a
 

251
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,990
the forward thrust you're going to add a
backward thrust

252
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,000
backward thrust
 

253
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,909
backward thrust
um your aim is to do the eight

254
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:44,919
um your aim is to do the eight
 

255
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,670
um your aim is to do the eight
directions and

256
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680
directions and
 

257
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,270
directions and
eventually um you're aiming to do a

258
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,280
eventually um you're aiming to do a
 

259
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,029
eventually um you're aiming to do a
360 so you go all the way around to to

260
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:56,039
360 so you go all the way around to to
 

261
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,589
360 so you go all the way around to to
um you're you're start you're starting

262
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:58,599
um you're you're start you're starting
 

263
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,710
um you're you're start you're starting
with your Jo front of you you do the

264
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
with your Jo front of you you do the
 

265
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,589
with your Jo front of you you do the
hassle you go all the way around 360 and

266
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
hassle you go all the way around 360 and
 

267
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,670
hassle you go all the way around 360 and
you then you cut finally in the

268
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:06,680
you then you cut finally in the
 

269
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,550
you then you cut finally in the
direction that you started so you're

270
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
direction that you started so you're
 

271
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,110
