00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,670
him lightning I stick with
it and follow back his light let

172
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
it and follow back his light let
 

173
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,629
it and follow back his light let
is

174
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:15,639
is
 

175
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,390
is
okay so we'll go slow so everyone can be

176
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:19,400
okay so we'll go slow so everyone can be
 

177
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,550
okay so we'll go slow so everyone can be
sensitive because what happens is if you

178
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,560
sensitive because what happens is if you
 

179
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,870
sensitive because what happens is if you
go like half F right no no no like like

180
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:25,880
go like half F right no no no like like

we were before you go a little quicker

182
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:28,759
we were before you go a little quicker
 

183
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,430
we were before you go a little quicker
see then a goes like that but it was

184
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
see then a goes like that but it was
 

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,670
see then a goes like that but it was
heavy and that in full speed I wouldn't

186
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
heavy and that in full speed I wouldn't
 

187
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,629
heavy and that in full speed I wouldn't
have been able to do that okay so I

188
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:37,639
have been able to do that okay so I
 

189

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:13,960
my grip to do this it just floats right
 

203
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,270
my grip to do this it just floats right
into place but do keep your grip okay

204

is I I'll absorb this
 

323
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,470
is I I'll absorb this
externally and then I'll do the rest

324
