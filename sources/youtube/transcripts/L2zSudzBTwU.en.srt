1
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,596
I'm originally from Osaka.

2
00:00:54,596 --> 00:01:01,270
An aikido club was created when I was in junior high school,

3
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,480
that was in 1978,

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,985
and one of my teacher had his own Aikido dojo,

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,946
so I trained at his dojo too.

6
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,575
After that I went to Kosen,

7
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:21,999
which is a 5 year technical college and I studied mechanical engineering.

8
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,334
There was no Aikido in my college

9
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,712
so I established a club, and I practiced there for 5 years.

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:31,466
In total, I did Aikido for 7 years in Osaka.

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:36,346
After I graduated in 1985,

12
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,098
I became an uchi deshi at Hombu Dojo,

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,226
I was 20 years old at the time.

14
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,277
From the time I started Aikido, I only did that.

15
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,406
Before that, I had done some Kendo in elementary school,

16
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,158
for about 4 years,

17
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,077
but as soon as I started Aikido, I dedicated myself to it.

18
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,417
I had.

19
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,962
During my 3rd year of High School,

20
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,090
I had saved money doing part-time jobs,

21
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,011
and I spent a week at Hombu Dojo during the spring holidays.

22
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,888
So I had trained there before.

23
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,598
GE: You trained there every day...

24
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,059
Yes, every day for a week,

25
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,693
I spent 3 years living at Hombu Dojo.

26
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,613
The life of an uchi deshi involved

27
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,573
getting up at 5:00 a.m.,

28
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,160
preparing tea with Doshu and the Sensei who taught the morning class,

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,703
preparing the hot water,

30
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:46,416
and cleaning the dojo and the office.

31
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,294
We used to finish at around 6:00 a.m.

32
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,422
and at 6:30 a.m., the training started.

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,345
The priority in our uchi deshi life at Hombu was training,

34
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,722
from morning to evening.

35
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,225
When there was no training,

36
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,643
we did the chores.

37
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,772
We had to do our own work such as

38
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,482
going to the post office to send the mail,

39
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,526
driving,

40
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,236
and many other tasks like these.

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:19,116
One of our important job was to be Otomo for the Sensei.

42
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,202
We had to carry the Sensei's bags and take ukemi.

43
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,080
That was our main learning experience.

44
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,546
It was occasional,

45
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,006
for example, when a Sensei went to a seminar.

46
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,300
These trips could take a day or longer.

47
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:42,347
We had to carry the sensei's bag, take care of things, and take ukemi for him.

48
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,352
That included trips inside Japan as well as abroad from time to time.

49
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,273
When abroad, we used to spend about a week with the Sensei.

50
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,866
I also went aborad with Kisshomaru Sensei,

51
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,494
to places such as

52
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,705
Italy twice,

53
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,708
South America,

54
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,462
Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.

55
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,423
During my time as Otomo,

56
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,717
I went to Germany too.

57
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,387
Tamura Sensei seemed to have a lot of fun,

58
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:27,392
but I couldn’t enjoy it much because for me, it was more like a job.

59
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:32,189
I was so tense all the time so when I was told to go to abroad, I wasn’t too happy about it.

60
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:40,071
After that, I went with the current Doshu,

61
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:46,495
as well as Seki Sensei.

62
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,040
We also did a Nihon Budokan group tour,

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,503
visiting Australia as a group.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,261
The practice is directed by the Shihan in place

65
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:08,725
and everybody learns the Shihan’s style.

66
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,271
This is why wherever you go, the practice is a little different.

67
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:19,486
but still, aikido is aikido, so things we teach are common,

68
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,862
but the teaching method is different,

69
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,738
it depends on teachers.

70
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,533
The ways people who interpret what a sensei teaches are also different,

71
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,742
so, that is okay as it is.

72
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,994
If everybody was the same, it'd be strange.

73
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:38,463
At that time, Kisshomaru Sensei was the Second Doshu

74
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,927
and the current Doshu was Waka-Sensei.

75
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,346
The old Sensei were in order seniority:

76
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:51,226
Okumura Sensei, Yamaguchi Sensei, Arikawa Sensei, Tada Sensei...

77
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,522
and there were Ichihashi Sensei, Masuda Sensei,

78
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,898
the senior Sensei,

79
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,692
Watanabe Sensei, Sasaki Sensei,

80
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,362
the senior Sensei of that period...

81
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:14,457
My Sempai living with me at Hombu were Kobayashi and Sugawara Sensei.

82
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,628
Those who moved in after were Kuribayashi and Kanazawa Sensei.

83
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,590
These were the people I lived with at Hombu.

84
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,263
I didn't have a main Sensei

85
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,100
the uchi deshi must go to the first morning class.

86
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,060
The morning practice of the Hombu Dojo

87
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,021
was Doshu's morning class,

88
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,024
which is the class of the Dojo-cho.

89
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:44,779
The name of Hombu Dojo used to be Ueshiba Dojo

90
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:52,662
so it was not like I followed a particular teacher but Doshu was at the center of my practice.

91
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:58,835
I attended other senseis’ classes to absorb their techniques

92
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,255
so I chose not to have a special Sensei.

93
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,470
That's right,

94
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,139
in my time, we weren't that busy...

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,643
We had a bit of time for ourselves.

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,938
Nowadays they're quite busy.

97
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,689
They spend more time teaching

98
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,817
but they don't have much time for their own training.

99
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,654
That’s how I feel.

100
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:35,080
Those who enter Hombu do so to become professionals.

101
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,083
They almost all dedicate themselves to it.

102
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,592
What's most important for an uchi deshi...

103
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,345
most of all...

104
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,179
the ukemi.

105
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,433
I thought of taking good ukemi all the time.

106
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,185
Those who were always called to take ukemi for Kisshomaru Sensei were

107
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:01,856
Miyamoto, Yokota, and Osawa Sensei,

108
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,026
those 3 were really good.

109
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:10,115
I was wondering how to become part of that group.

110
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:14,953
Then, Doshu started using me as uke, and things became even more difficult after that.

111
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:19,000
When I was uchi deshi, I was only thinking about ukemi.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,756
The fact of working on the technique and becoming a better technician came later.

113
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,058
Well, I spent 10 years at Hombu Dojo,

114
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,810
3 years as an uchi deshi,

115
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,312
and 7 more years living in my own appartment

116
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,733
so in total I spent 10 years at the Tokyo Hombu.

117
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,112
After that came a turning point in my life.

118
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:55,618
After these 10 years, I wanted to return to teach in Sanda.

119
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,705
I wasn't fired from Hombu!

120
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,013
I'm doing my own style.

121
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:08,186
I learned from various Sensei

122
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,690
including Saito and Chiba Sensei.

123
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:19,197
There are also other budo like kenjutsu or iai.

124
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,951
When you watch videos of the founder,

125
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:27,747
he does taijutsu but he also uses weapons like ken and jo.

126
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,750
He explained the meaning of aikido using weapons, the link between taijutsu and weapons.

127
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,752
I think that's important.

128
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,005
Weapons and taijutsu aren't disconnected.

129
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,466
The basis is the same.

130
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:43,429
If one wants to understand taijutsu more deeply, one should practice weapons.

131
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,350
I agree with that so we practice weapons in my dojo.

132
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:56,317
We tend to do whatever style our own teacher is practicing.

133
00:12:56,317 --> 00:13:02,699
When we follow a teacher, we don't have the choice, we must follow what he does.

134
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,370
You would want to know what the teacher is looking for in these practices.

135
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,416
If the Sensei does something like Shinkage-ryu,

136
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,295
when you practice, you remember that,

137
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:20,633
and after, it may be better to make up your own thing.

138
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,978
There are very few weapons video left in the period of the Asahi newspaper.

139
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,648
During his youth, the founder learned a lot of ken

140
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,736
and from there, it changed little by little later in life at 70 or 80 years-old.

141
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,573
There isn't much footage left from that period.

142
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:49,829
There is almost nothing left from the Asahi newspaper period.

143
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:55,084
We must remember that his technique, including his taijutsu, evolved a lot through time.

144
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,505
At the beginning he was throwing very hard but he then got softer in his later years.

145
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,258
He became softer in the same way.

146
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:09,015
The founder did some Itto-ryu.

147
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,019
There are some old videos and

148
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,148
at the last moment, it ends with a cut.

149
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:21,986
O Sensei said his partner couldn't understand why he got cut.

150
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:29,911
The kumitachi of Saito Sensei are all like that of the Itto-ryu cuts.

151
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,997
I do  them too.

152
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,875
Only learning the form makes no sense,

153
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:41,089
we need to train a lot to understand the meaning of that finishing cut.

154
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:30,721
Aioi originates from the Hyogo prefecture near Himeji.

155
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,433
There is a shrine there were

156
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,893
the Aioi-No-Matsu grows.

157
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:43,985
It's a black and a red pine trees that grow together from the same trunk.

158
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,904
It is the same kanji for Aioi.

159
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:53,536
It symbolizes the strong relationship of a couple.

160
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:58,082
In my dojo, it represents the relationship between teacher and students.

161
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,420
The students and the teacher study together and grow.

162
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,131
That's the meaning of Aioi.

163
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,135
By chance, it happens to be the name of this neighborhood too [Aioicho], so it's perfect.

164
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,344
GE: But the kanji is different right?

165
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,095
No, it's the same.

166
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:11,554
GE: Is it?

167
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,974
Yes, the same, the meaning is "to live together".

168
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,776
I'm alone so I can't learn from everybody.

169
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:34,994
So when I visit a place that has a different style of practice,

170
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:39,165
I can only show my own thing.

171
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,002
I suggest to do it like that.

172
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:48,299
"This is my way to do this, please try it"

173
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,178
I don't force them to do my way saying "this has to be like this".

174
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,223
but instead: "you can do it like that too".

175
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,355
For example, in the basics,

176
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,359
even if we consider that there's only one katate dori irimi tenkan,

177
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,653
the movement is done differently by different Sensei.

178
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,614
It's a way to express one's difference.

179
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:16,953
I don't like the idea of doing strange or complicated techniques to impress others.

180
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,996
I only like to research the basics.

181
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:23,334
Shomenuchi ikkyo could be different,

182
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:27,213
every Shihan can do differently, they think differently, they teach differently.

183
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:32,760
I have my way to do it but it's not exclusive to me.

184
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,805
In iriminage, I explain my way of taking the balance.

185
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,392
It applies in the same way to beginners and Yudansha.

186
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,436
We do different things but we are on the same theme.

187
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,231
There is no need to show flashy things.

188
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,321
To tell you the truth,

189
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,742
we should start seminars by teaching the role of uke.

190
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,078
I can't do it when I travel though.

191
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,873
It's not just about "falling", we need to know until when to stay present,

192
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:07,628
and hold until the very last minute of tori’s waza.

193
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,881
I can teach that to my own students,

194
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,094
but when I give short seminars, it's more difficult.

195
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,138
This is a bit difficult right?

196
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,349
That's why teaching at some seminars is not very interesting.

197
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,853
Instead of giving one-shot seminars in many places, I try to go to the same places regularly.

198
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,360
I don't teach falls as such

199
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,487
but I give precise instructions during practice such as:

200
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,781
"You let go too early", etc.

201
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,117
What I teach is how to receive the technique, which is ukemi.

202
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,037
Ukemi is something you do to protect your body for safety,

203
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:46,709
but ukemi is how to receive the technique of the partner. I teach how to take ukemi.

204
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,210
I teach them to hold more,

205
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,712
don’t take uke too fast,

206
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,005
slow is bad, but being too fast is worse.

207
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,717
For example, you take ukemi too fast before your partner even throw you.

208
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,017
When I teach, I take ukemi for my students too.

209
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:09,940
They can learn how to take ukemi by watching my uke and feeling something by throwing me.

210
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,277
In ken, there is uketachi and uchitachi right?

211
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,071
The Shihan is the one taking ukemi right?

212
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,072
GE: That's right.

213
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,949
It works also in Aikido to a certain degree.

214
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,203
Even though with age, my body starts to ache everywhere,

215
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:26,415
and I can't take ukemi in the same way, but I can still show how.

216
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,501
When we are an odd number,

217
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,753
I take ukemi to complete the pairs.

218
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,513
I visit groups affiliated with the Aioikai every year,

219
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,306
and I conduct grading examinations

220
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,976
I teach at the same level as here.

221
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,146
I only go once a year

222
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,107
so there are things that don't get through

223
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:57,321
but in spite of that, I try to make myself understood.

224
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,324
I have been going to some places for over 10 years.

225
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,704
In Russia, it has been only 2 years so there is still a lot of work to do.

226
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,916
They don't understand everything I do

227
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:15,923
but they realize that 1 seminar per year requires a lot of efforts on their part.

228
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,053
I can only be there for a week so they do their best to learn within that time.

229
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:26,517
It pleases me very much and makes me want to return there any number of times.

230
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,771
I want to raise the level of the Aioikai

231
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,442
so I need to train some leaders locally.

232
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:41,115
I want to train instructors who can lead and support them

233
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,243
but right now, we are far from that.

234
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:51,208
In the one-off seminars, I want to put my personality and my own Aikido forward as much as I can,

235
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,671
I want to present my Aikido to them

236
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,175
and ask them what they think about it.

237
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,144
When I was at Hombu Dojo, Chiba Sensei was living in San Diego.

238
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:15,733
Occasionally, when he returned to Japan, we practiced together in Kisshomaru Sensei's classes

239
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,902
but it wasn't many.

240
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,076
Yes but not exclusively in the Birankai.

241
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:30,748
I go to Europe in Poland, which is affiliated to the Birankai.

242
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,583
I go to Bulgaria too...

243
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,709
where else...

244
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,213
different places but not all affiliated to the Birankai.

245
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:42,718
The first seminar I participated was held about 10 years ago,

246
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:47,306
it was a course in San Diego

247
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:53,312
and Doshu went there to discuss about Chiba Sensei's retirement.

248
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,654
I had never learned from Chiba sensei directly, so I thought it would be a great opportunity.

249
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:08,118
Several people taught in the seminar, including Miyamoto Sensei

250
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:17,628
and I was asked by Chiba sensei to teach one class there, so I did.

251
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:23,592
My dojo celebrates its 20 years next year.

252
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:30,015
At some point, there was a time I got lost in my training. There were things to think about.

253
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:38,023
At that time, by chance, I came accross a video of Chiba Sensei shot in Nagoya.

254
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,277
It made me want to learn this kind of style.

255
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:45,656
From that point, I started to work in that direction.

256
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:51,412
Until that point I had never really talked to Chiba Sensei.

257
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,291
Since I started working on the style,

258
00:22:55,291 --> 00:23:03,799
I have been asked by Chiba sensei to teach Birankai seminars in Europe.

259
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,261
Because of the land prices.

260
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,933
Buying land to set up a dojo in Osaka was expensive

261
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,810
whereas Sanda was more affordable.

262
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,603
It's also closer from the station.

263
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,897
I ended up here by chance.

264
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,488
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday,

265
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,867
about 4 hours per day.

266
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,744
An hour and a half in the morning

267
00:24:55,828 --> 00:25:05,170
In the evening I teach an hour and another one hour and a half without break. So, I teach about 4 hours on average.

268
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,422
In addition to that,

269
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:11,885
I teach at branch dojos and universities.

270
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,980
She teaches the children's class on Tuesdays.

271
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,607
GE: And she replaces you when you are abroad...

272
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,859
Yes, yes.

273
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,529
She helps here as well as at other branch dojos.

274
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,199
She is there today, she goes on Saturdays and Sundays.

275
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:39,913
When I'm not here, her and the shidoin, do the teaching.

276
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,715
They probably want to start but in Japan, it's difficult.

277
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,008
Places would be a problem

278
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,802
and salarymen are busy.

279
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,513
Here I have Shidoin examinations every two years.

280
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:03,187
The Shidoin and Fukushidoin of Aoi receive a certificate.

281
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:13,238
There is one place that was opened by a man who retired.

282
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,574
But it's difficult.

283
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:27,669
The most important in Aikido and Budo in general is to keep the beginners mind.

284
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,632
The most important is not to forget the sensations we had when we first entered the dojo,

285
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,551
the feelings we had when we first started Aikido,

286
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,680
the first ukemi we took for our first Sensei...

287
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,810
We shouldn't loose the beginner's mind.

288
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,856
In addition to that, we should also take practice seriously.

289
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:53,278
I’m not talking about the seminars that only my students attend

290
00:26:53,278 --> 00:27:01,662
but when several different groups come to the seminars, there are something I see there during the class and that makes me think.

291
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,374
There are sometimes people who don't take practice seriously.

292
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,376
Some people try to test their partner,

293
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,795
they try to take strange ukemi.

294
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,799
I dislike this kind of practice.

295
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,512
When we do the technique, we do it seriously.

296
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,848
When we take ukemi, we do it seriously.

297
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:25,519
We don't hold back, we don't lower our standards.

298
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,897
We must practice seriously and with rigor.

299
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:33,610
It isn't something that can be taught with words, it is somethign that is shown with the body.

300
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:43,495
My students see it and feel it from me, so it’s easy to teach here. I do the same when I go to other dojos where I teach regularly.

301
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:53,922
And also I think "good manners" of Aikido is the basis for everything else and we have to start from that.

302
00:27:53,922 --> 00:28:02,598
I don't do complicated techniques, I usually work on basic techniques.

303
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:06,852
There are things that come before doing Budo’s "BU".

304
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,564
Like bowing properly when entering a dojo,

305
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,941
and aligning the shoes at the entrance of a Dojo,

306
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,569
You start from a proper place.

307
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,905
Starting from that,

308
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:23,994
the relationships between Shihan and students becomes important. Relationship with mutual trust.

309
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,371
It should not be one direction only.

310
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:35,797
When we get to know each other more, trust and a mutual respect take place, and we can delve more deeply into each other.
