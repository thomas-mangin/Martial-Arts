1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,269

okay uh

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
okay uh
 

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,249
okay uh
so you understand

4
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:07,259
so you understand
 

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,129
so you understand
your training model is always

6
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:10,139
your training model is always
 

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,549
your training model is always
uh following the only one there is

8
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559
uh following the only one there is
 

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,970
uh following the only one there is
you're going to utilize stress

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:16,980
you're going to utilize stress
 

11
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,269
you're going to utilize stress
to generate an adaptation

12
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:20,279
to generate an adaptation
 

13
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,090
to generate an adaptation
the potential for that adaptation is

14
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,100
the potential for that adaptation is
 

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,650
the potential for that adaptation is
always within you

16
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:24,660
always within you
 

17
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,929
always within you
it's not something separate from you

18
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:26,939
it's not something separate from you
 

19
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,029
it's not something separate from you
okay

20
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
okay
 

21
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,410
okay
um

22
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,420
um
 

23
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,470
um
but it is something that you have

24
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
but it is something that you have
 

25
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,889
but it is something that you have
you do not have access to okay then you

26
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:36,899
you do not have access to okay then you
 

27
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,490
you do not have access to okay then you
have your training equations right so uh

28
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:40,500
have your training equations right so uh
 

29
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,190
have your training equations right so uh
the more stressful the cultivation field

30
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
the more stressful the cultivation field
 

31
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,690
the more stressful the cultivation field
is

32
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:44,700
is
 

33
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,229
is
the more needed the adaptation is

34
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
the more needed the adaptation is
 

35
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,229
the more needed the adaptation is
the more needed the adaptation the less

36
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:51,239
the more needed the adaptation the less
 

37
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,510
the more needed the adaptation the less
likely you are to cultivate it so

38
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
likely you are to cultivate it so
 

39
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,850
likely you are to cultivate it so
there's this balance that you have to do

40
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:55,860
there's this balance that you have to do
 

41
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,250
there's this balance that you have to do
okay

42
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,260
okay
 

43
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,170
okay
um

44
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,180
um
 

45
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,270
um
but

46
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
but
 

47
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,789
but
it doesn't change just because we're

48
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
it doesn't change just because we're
 

49
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,789
it doesn't change just because we're
working at the physical component or at

50
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:07,799
working at the physical component or at
 

51
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,649
working at the physical component or at
the energetic component

52
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:09,659
the energetic component
 

53
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,570
the energetic component
so we're going to look we're going to

54
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:11,580
so we're going to look we're going to
 

55
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,190
so we're going to look we're going to
utilize this training model this

56
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
utilize this training model this
 

57
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,950
utilize this training model this
cultivation model

58
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
cultivation model
 

59
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,750
cultivation model
energetically all right

60
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:17,760
energetically all right
 

61
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,789
energetically all right
so when we talk about the energetic

62
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
so when we talk about the energetic
 

63
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,950
so when we talk about the energetic
component we have to remember that

64
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
component we have to remember that
 

65
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,749
component we have to remember that
aikido's

66
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
aikido's
 

67
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,649
aikido's
uh epistemology is concentric and so the

68
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:27,659
uh epistemology is concentric and so the
 

69
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,570
uh epistemology is concentric and so the
to get you in the ballpark you want to

70
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:29,580
to get you in the ballpark you want to
 

71
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,469
to get you in the ballpark you want to
remember uh so Above So Below

72
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:33,479
remember uh so Above So Below
 

73
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,249
remember uh so Above So Below
so out so without So within

74
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:37,259
so out so without So within
 

75
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,609
so out so without So within
okay so outside so inside

76
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:40,619
okay so outside so inside
 

77
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,850
okay so outside so inside
so you can look for example at the

78
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:43,860
so you can look for example at the
 

79
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,569
so you can look for example at the
energetic component externally in terms

80
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:47,579
energetic component externally in terms
 

81
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,969
energetic component externally in terms
of Yin and Yang so remember what we're

82
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:49,979
of Yin and Yang so remember what we're
 

83
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,030
of Yin and Yang so remember what we're
trying to do is two things the lower

84
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
trying to do is two things the lower
 

85
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,789
trying to do is two things the lower
level thing or the entry level thing is

86
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:55,799
level thing or the entry level thing is
 

87
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,370
level thing or the entry level thing is
harmonizing and Young

88
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:58,380
harmonizing and Young
 

89
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,010
harmonizing and Young
and then the higher level thing is to

90
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
and then the higher level thing is to
 

91
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,109
and then the higher level thing is to
reconcile Union where they cease to

92
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
reconcile Union where they cease to
 

93
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,910
reconcile Union where they cease to
exist okay

94
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:04,920
exist okay
 

95
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,850
exist okay
so if we why we need to harmonize yin

96
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:07,860
so if we why we need to harmonize yin
 

97
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,710
so if we why we need to harmonize yin
and yang because if you don't harmonize

98
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:09,720
and yang because if you don't harmonize
 

99
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,470
and yang because if you don't harmonize
yin and yang you can't lead to a

100
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
yin and yang you can't lead to a
 

101
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,530
yin and yang you can't lead to a
Reconciliation of Yin and Yang okay if

102
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:15,540
Reconciliation of Yin and Yang okay if
 

103
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,050
Reconciliation of Yin and Yang okay if
you if you want you could understand the

104
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
you if you want you could understand the
 

105
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,990
you if you want you could understand the
ultimate harmonization that yin and yang

106
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,000
ultimate harmonization that yin and yang
 

107
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,949
ultimate harmonization that yin and yang
is a Reconciliation of Yin and Yang okay

108
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:23,959
is a Reconciliation of Yin and Yang okay
 

109
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,229
is a Reconciliation of Yin and Yang okay
so a contradicting yin and yang will

110
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:27,239
so a contradicting yin and yang will
 

111
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,510
so a contradicting yin and yang will
never lead to a reconciling of Yin and

112
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
never lead to a reconciling of Yin and
 

113
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,270
never lead to a reconciling of Yin and
Young so if we look at this externally

114
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
Young so if we look at this externally
 

115
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,729
Young so if we look at this externally
for example

116
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:34,739
for example
 

117
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,770
for example
um

118
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:35,780
um
 

119
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,990
um
he stands up and will work from the

120
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
he stands up and will work from the
 

121
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,130
he stands up and will work from the
clinch so you more understand it than if

122
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,140
clinch so you more understand it than if
 

123
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,530
clinch so you more understand it than if
we put it in keyhon because you have all

124
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,540
we put it in keyhon because you have all
 

125
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,990
we put it in keyhon because you have all
kinds of magical powers in Keyhole okay

126
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
kinds of magical powers in Keyhole okay
 

127
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,949
kinds of magical powers in Keyhole okay
which are not real so if we're in the

128
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:51,959
which are not real so if we're in the
 

129
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,990
which are not real so if we're in the
clinch and we're shoving at each other

130
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
clinch and we're shoving at each other
 

131
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,970
clinch and we're shoving at each other
do you see

132
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:55,980
do you see
 

133
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,449
do you see
this I have young energy and he has

134
00:02:59,449 --> 00:02:59,459
this I have young energy and he has
 

135
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,589
this I have young energy and he has
young energy so here it kind of looks

136
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
young energy so here it kind of looks
 

137
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,150
young energy so here it kind of looks
like it'll work

138
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,160
like it'll work
 

139
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,550
like it'll work
because we're in that stalemate you see

140
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
because we're in that stalemate you see
 

141
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,930
because we're in that stalemate you see
so marshally but

142
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:10,940
so marshally but
 

143
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,850
so marshally but
energetically it's a young young Clash

144
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:13,860
energetically it's a young young Clash
 

145
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,550
energetically it's a young young Clash
okay and when you have a young young

146
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
okay and when you have a young young
 

147
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,910
okay and when you have a young young
Clash because yin and yang is relative

148
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
Clash because yin and yang is relative
 

149
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,149
Clash because yin and yang is relative
Whoever has more yawn is gonna make the

150
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:23,159
Whoever has more yawn is gonna make the
 

151
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,670
Whoever has more yawn is gonna make the
other one yet do you understand that so

152
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
other one yet do you understand that so
 

153
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,750
other one yet do you understand that so
if you come out

154
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760

 

155
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,990

and uh we we push into each other you

156
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,000
and uh we we push into each other you
 

157
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,809
and uh we we push into each other you
see you push into me and I can you don't

158
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:35,819
see you push into me and I can you don't
 

159
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,910
see you push into me and I can you don't
have enough young energy

160
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
have enough young energy
 

161
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,550
have enough young energy
to overcome me you automatically by

162
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
to overcome me you automatically by
 

163
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,149
to overcome me you automatically by
default become yeah okay

164
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
default become yeah okay
 

165
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,789
default become yeah okay
so

166
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
so
 

167
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,509
so
what we do in an external harmonization

168
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:50,519
what we do in an external harmonization
 

169
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,050
what we do in an external harmonization
of Yin and Yang as he pushes at me

170
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,060
of Yin and Yang as he pushes at me
 

171
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,770
of Yin and Yang as he pushes at me

509
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,710
Reconciliation of Yin and Yang do you
see and then to understand that that

510
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:27,720
see and then to understand that that
 

511
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,710
see and then to understand that that
reconciliation in gonosen has to happen

512
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
reconciliation in gonosen has to happen
 

513
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,610
reconciliation in gonosen has to happen
way earlier than we might think okay

514
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:34,620
way earlier than we might think okay
 

515
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,009
way earlier than we might think okay
but in the technique if you paid

516
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:37,019
but in the technique if you paid
 

517
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,470
but in the technique if you paid
attention you would you would know there

518
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,480
attention you would you would know there
 

519
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,050
attention you would you would know there
was a lot of internal reconciliation

520
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,060
was a lot of internal reconciliation
 

521
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,550
was a lot of internal reconciliation
that was happening

522
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,560
that was happening
 

523
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,250
that was happening
here in this technique I'm going to make

524
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,260
here in this technique I'm going to make
 

525
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,050
here in this technique I'm going to make
it such that it's going to be more

526
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,060
it such that it's going to be more
 

527
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,170
it such that it's going to be more
revealing of the external reconciliation

528
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,180
revealing of the external reconciliation
 

529
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,949
revealing of the external reconciliation
that's happening okay so uh but we do

530
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
that's happening okay so uh but we do
 

531
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,230
that's happening okay so uh but we do
have one

532
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,240
have one
 

533
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,269
have one
one kind of

534
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
one kind of
 

535
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,690
one kind of
um more overtly or easily more easily to

536
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:02,700
um more overtly or easily more easily to
 

537
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,550
um more overtly or easily more easily to
see on video an external reconciliation

538
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
see on video an external reconciliation
 

539
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,750
see on video an external reconciliation
okay so I can't out young that arm on

540
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
okay so I can't out young that arm on
 

541
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,810
okay so I can't out young that arm on
him I can't make this thing come off of

542
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:14,820
him I can't make this thing come off of
 

543
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,690
him I can't make this thing come off of
my neck okay

544
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,700

 

545
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,350

so she has her neck hold you see and I

546
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,360
so she has her neck hold you see and I
 

547
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,569
so she has her neck hold you see and I
can barely get that off but I was able

548
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:26,579
can barely get that off but I was able
 

549
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,490
can barely get that off but I was able
to get it off so that might be my

550
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,500
to get it off so that might be my
 

551
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,430
to get it off so that might be my
technique you see and I come around but

552
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
technique you see and I come around but
 

553
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,910
technique you see and I come around but
again you try that on Taylor's

554
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920

 

555
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,129

you with your left hand try to clear

556
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,139
you with your left hand try to clear
 

557
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,829
you with your left hand try to clear
your neck hole

558
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
your neck hole
 

559
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,650
your neck hole
not gonna happen it's never going to

560
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:45,660
not gonna happen it's never going to
 

561
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,230
not gonna happen it's never going to
happen because that's a young young

562
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
happen because that's a young young
 

563
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,069
happen because that's a young young
Clash but he has Superior yawn you will

564
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
Clash but he has Superior yawn you will
 

565
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,550
Clash but he has Superior yawn you will
be the losing the loser on that okay

566
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:55,560
be the losing the loser on that okay
 

567
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,850
be the losing the loser on that okay
so what what I'm doing on the first one

568
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:58,860
so what what I'm doing on the first one
 

569
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,009
so what what I'm doing on the first one
he holds really tight I feed outside all

570
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:04,019
he holds really tight I feed outside all
 

571
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,009
he holds really tight I feed outside all
of this this has not being utilized it's

572
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:07,019
of this this has not being utilized it's
 

573
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,290
of this this has not being utilized it's
just in an IP adhesion which I'll

574
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,300
just in an IP adhesion which I'll
 

575
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,290
just in an IP adhesion which I'll
demonstrate later and I go around these

576
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,300
demonstrate later and I go around these
 

577
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,150
demonstrate later and I go around these
fingers

578
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
fingers
 

579
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,750
fingers
you see and the hand falls

580
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
you see and the hand falls
 

581
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,389
you see and the hand falls
I'm not shoving the hand down

582
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
I'm not shoving the hand down
 

583
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,910
I'm not shoving the hand down
I go around he's got it really tight

584
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:22,920
I go around he's got it really tight
 

585
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,790
I go around he's got it really tight
there's no way I could get that off so I

586
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:25,800
there's no way I could get that off so I
 

587
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,329
there's no way I could get that off so I
go around the fingers and the hand falls

588
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:29,339
go around the fingers and the hand falls
 

589
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,990
go around the fingers and the hand falls
and I connect to the hand okay so that's

590
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,000
and I connect to the hand okay so that's
 

591
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,030
and I connect to the hand okay so that's
where I see some of you are losing the

592
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
where I see some of you are losing the
 

593
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,750
where I see some of you are losing the
hand

594
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:35,760
hand
 

595
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,050
hand
okay

596
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,060

 

597
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,490

but

598
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,500
but
 

599
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,189
but
let's pay attention to you

600
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
let's pay attention to you
 

601
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,750
let's pay attention to you
you heal it and I will try to

602
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:44,760
you heal it and I will try to
 

603
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,590
you heal it and I will try to
demonstrate what's going on okay by

604
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
demonstrate what's going on okay by
 

605
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,689
demonstrate what's going on okay by
exaggerating the stressor

606
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:50,699
exaggerating the stressor
 

607
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,250
exaggerating the stressor
so

608
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,260
so
 

609
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,870
so
here

610
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:53,880
here
 

611
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,470
here
this is me externally pushing into him

612
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
this is me externally pushing into him
 

613
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,670
this is me externally pushing into him
what I'm doing here is his young energy

614
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
what I'm doing here is his young energy
 

615
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,090
what I'm doing here is his young energy
I'm grounding it and I'm actually in his

616
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,100
I'm grounding it and I'm actually in his
 

617
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,290
I'm grounding it and I'm actually in his
center now

618
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:06,300
center now
 

619
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,610
center now
so the same movement for example let's

620
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:10,620
so the same movement for example let's
 

621
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,170
so the same movement for example let's
say uh

622
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,180
say uh
 

623
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,629
say uh
you you uh

624
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
you you uh
 

625
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,990
you you uh
try to move your hand like you're going

626
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
try to move your hand like you're going
 

627
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,410
try to move your hand like you're going
to uh maybe you need to come around

628
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:21,420
to uh maybe you need to come around
 

629
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,310
to uh maybe you need to come around
like he's uh going to punch me go ahead

630
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,320
like he's uh going to punch me go ahead
 

631
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,449
like he's uh going to punch me go ahead
okay did you see that step Pizza okay

632
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:29,459
okay did you see that step Pizza okay
 

633
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,470
okay did you see that step Pizza okay
so I have his Center internally

634
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,480
so I have his Center internally
 

635
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,710
so I have his Center internally
and just by the simple change of his

636
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
and just by the simple change of his
 

637
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,389
and just by the simple change of his
geometry

638
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
geometry
 

639
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,689
geometry
he he lost his balance and he had to put

640
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:41,699
he he lost his balance and he had to put
 

641
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,329
he he lost his balance and he had to put
his base of support back under him did

642
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:44,339
his base of support back under him did
 

643
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,449
his base of support back under him did
you feel that okay it's not he goes to

644
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:47,459
you feel that okay it's not he goes to
 

645
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,810
you feel that okay it's not he goes to
move his arm and then I moved him

646
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:50,820
move his arm and then I moved him
 

647
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,749
move his arm and then I moved him
so you're watching the same thing maybe

648
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
so you're watching the same thing maybe
 

649
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,110
so you're watching the same thing maybe
you look for me I don't move he moved

650
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
you look for me I don't move he moved
 

651
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,629
you look for me I don't move he moved
his arm and it took him off balance okay

652
00:16:59,629 --> 00:16:59,639
his arm and it took him off balance okay
 

653
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,110
his arm and it took him off balance okay
for you as I'm training you I'd like for

654
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
for you as I'm training you I'd like for
 

655
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,549
for you as I'm training you I'd like for
you to feel

656
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
you to feel
 

657
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,130
you to feel
that do you feel that okay so he goes to

658
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
that do you feel that okay so he goes to
 

659
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,669
that do you feel that okay so he goes to
move his arm and he has to step to

660
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:10,679
move his arm and he has to step to
 

661
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,270
move his arm and he has to step to
regain the balance okay that means he's

662
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
regain the balance okay that means he's
 

663
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,390
regain the balance okay that means he's
actually in a state of kazushi

664
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
actually in a state of kazushi
 

665
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,630
actually in a state of kazushi
internally do you see he's off balance

666
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:19,640
internally do you see he's off balance
 

667
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,189
internally do you see he's off balance
in the sense that he does not have

668
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:22,199
in the sense that he does not have
 

669
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,829
in the sense that he does not have
control of his balance I have control of

670
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:24,839
control of his balance I have control of
 

671
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,250
control of his balance I have control of
his balance which I did internally by

672
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,260
his balance which I did internally by
 

673
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,270
his balance which I did internally by
harmonizing Yin and y'all okay so uh

674
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,280
harmonizing Yin and y'all okay so uh
 

675
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,190
harmonizing Yin and y'all okay so uh
another one is uh let's say he tries to

676
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
another one is uh let's say he tries to
 

677
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,169
another one is uh let's say he tries to
pull back out so he tries to pull back

678
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:39,179
pull back out so he tries to pull back
 

679
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,650
pull back out so he tries to pull back
out okay so same thing he goes to pull

680
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:42,660
out okay so same thing he goes to pull
 

681
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,230
out okay so same thing he goes to pull
back out and same thing his balance gets

682
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,240
back out and same thing his balance gets
 

683
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,350
back out and same thing his balance gets
lost okay it's not that he goes back out

684
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,360
lost okay it's not that he goes back out

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:35,580
move have a center
 

721
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,750
move have a center
he moves boom makes his balance go off

722
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:38,760
he moves boom makes his balance go off
 

723
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,470

and then you have this rubber okay what

724
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
and then you have this rubber okay what
 

725
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,450
and then you have this rubber okay what
you'll find

726
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:44,460
you'll find
 

727
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,150
you'll find
if you don't have your Center

728
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,160
if you don't have your Center
 

729
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,130
if you don't have your Center
if he doesn't have my sinner don't try

730
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,140
if he doesn't have my sinner don't try
 

731
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,409
if he doesn't have my sinner don't try
to connect to it and I could just move

732
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:51,419
to connect to it and I could just move
 

733
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,070
to connect to it and I could just move
freely without losing my balance okay

734
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,080
freely without losing my balance okay
 

735
00:18:55,080 --> 00:20:08,230
freely without losing my balance okay
so let's try that one

736
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240

 

737
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,090

okay so we're we already know from God

738
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,100
okay so we're we already know from God
 

739
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,890
okay so we're we already know from God
no sen that the initiative already

740
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:12,900
no sen that the initiative already
 

741
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,830
no sen that the initiative already
happened right and so the idea that

742
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
happened right and so the idea that
 

743
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,010
happened right and so the idea that
you're actually going to move

744
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,020
you're actually going to move
 

745
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,350
you're actually going to move
when you feel or see my arm coming

746
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
when you feel or see my arm coming
 

747
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,890
when you feel or see my arm coming
that's not going to happen Okay so as

748
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:24,900
that's not going to happen Okay so as
 

749
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,049
that's not going to happen Okay so as
we're here and uh she's trying the

750
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:27,059
we're here and uh she's trying the
 

751
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,890
we're here and uh she's trying the
technique don't let me punch you you see

752
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:30,900
technique don't let me punch you you see
 

753
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,610
technique don't let me punch you you see
imagine I have a knife

754
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:34,620

 

755
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,070

she can never move fast enough do you

756
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
she can never move fast enough do you
 

757
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,049
she can never move fast enough do you
understand so this is where the internal

understand so this is where the internal
 

759
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,990
understand so this is where the internal
aspects are very martial because I

760
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
aspects are very martial because I
 

761
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,669
aspects are very martial because I

already have him in kazushi internally
and as he moves I still had him it took

768
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:51,900
and as he moves I still had him it took
 

769
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,870
and as he moves I still had him it took
him off balance and so as he goes to

770
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:53,880
him off balance and so as he goes to
 

771
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,350
him off balance and so as he goes to
strike I'm already knee kicking him from

772
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
strike I'm already knee kicking him from
 

773
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,590
strike I'm already knee kicking him from
him being in kazushi the idea that I'll

774
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:00,600
him being in kazushi the idea that I'll
 

775
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,210
him being in kazushi the idea that I'll
be able to move it's not going to work

776
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,220
be able to move it's not going to work
 

777
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,890
be able to move it's not going to work
okay

778
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:06,900

 

779
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,870

same thing goes

780
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
same thing goes
 

781
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,750
same thing goes
we can add the stressor

782
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
we can add the stressor
 

783
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,810

786
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
do you see internally his energy needs
 

787
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,590
do you see internally his energy needs
to come inside me

788
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
to come inside me
 

789
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,470
to come inside me
it's young energy I bounce it off the

790
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
it's young energy I bounce it off the
 

791
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,770
it's young energy I bounce it off the
ground it comes back up as Yin energy it

you do not need anything but a pinpoint
 

803
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,289

whoa keep your balance ground ground
 

837
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,950
whoa keep your balance ground ground
break it he's gonna ride with it okay

838

try it go

840
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,100

 

841
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,430

you want to be on your toes

842
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440

 

843
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:07,250

thank you

844
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,260

on your toes
 

847
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:17,210
on your toes
without leaning

848
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,220

 

849
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,210

hey

850
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:20,220

 

851
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,970

so what you what you're seeing

852
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:22,980
so what you what you're seeing
 

853
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,390
so what you what you're seeing
internally is not not necessarily A

854
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
internally is not not necessarily A
 

855
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,830
internally is not not necessarily A
harmonization of Yin and Yang but a

856
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
harmonization of Yin and Yang but a
 

857

harmonization of Yin and Yang but a
Reconciliation of Gideon young okay so

858
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:33,179
Reconciliation of Gideon young okay so
 

859
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,330
Reconciliation of Gideon young okay so
that's why you see no movement in my

860
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,340
that's why you see no movement in my
 

861
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,750
that's why you see no movement in my
body and it generates a a an outcome on

862
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:38,760
body and it generates a a an outcome on
 

863
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,390
body and it generates a a an outcome on
him physically so for example in that

864
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,400
him physically so for example in that
 

865
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,970
him physically so for example in that
first drill when when I have his Center

866
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:43,980
first drill when when I have his Center
 

867
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,850
first drill when when I have his Center
and he goes to move it starts to take

868
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:46,860
and he goes to move it starts to take
 

869
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,890
and he goes to move it starts to take
him off balance okay

870
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:48,900
him off balance okay
 

871
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,289
him off balance okay
and I didn't have to move

872
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:51,299
and I didn't have to move
 

873
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,950
and I didn't have to move
all right so same way here as I come

874
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
all right so same way here as I come
 

875
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,870
all right so same way here as I come
back

876
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:55,880
back
 

877
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,590
back
and I am I am stuck on him as he stuck

878
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:00,600
and I am I am stuck on him as he stuck
 

879
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,590
and I am I am stuck on him as he stuck
on me right so last time I used it

880
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
on me right so last time I used it
 

881
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,830
on me right so last time I used it
passively with gonosen as he went to

882
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:06,840
passively with gonosen as he went to
 

883
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,049
passively with gonosen as he went to
punch that's what brought him off

884
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:09,059
punch that's what brought him off
 

885
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,330
punch that's what brought him off
balancing into the opening but you can

886
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:11,340
balancing into the opening but you can
 

887
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,630
balancing into the opening but you can
do it with the initiative timing okay so

888
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
do it with the initiative timing okay so
 

889
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,230
do it with the initiative timing okay so
as soon as I feel him press boom that

890
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
as soon as I feel him press boom that
 

891
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,990
as soon as I feel him press boom that
gives me that connection there and you

892
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,000
gives me that connection there and you
 

893
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,510
gives me that connection there and you
could use the same connection internally

894
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
could use the same connection internally
 

895
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,830
could use the same connection internally
to move his whole body right

896
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840

 

897
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,370

without doing it externally okay without

898
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:31,380
without doing it externally okay without
 

899
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,630
without doing it externally okay without
having to move around just let it go and

900
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:35,640
having to move around just let it go and
 

901
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,770
having to move around just let it go and
you're carrying them throughout the

902
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:36,780
you're carrying them throughout the
 

903
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,409
you're carrying them throughout the
whole technique that way okay let's try

904
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:39,419
whole technique that way okay let's try
 

905
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:52,870
whole technique that way okay let's try
that one

906
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880

 

907
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,669

so likewise in the technique that I'm

908
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
so likewise in the technique that I'm
 

909
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,690
so likewise in the technique that I'm
doing once once I peel her stuff

910
00:24:59,690 --> 00:24:59,700
doing once once I peel her stuff
 

911
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,690
doing once once I peel her stuff
you see so I could peel

912
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:02,700
you see so I could peel
 

913
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,930
you see so I could peel
and not leave this balance there

914
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:05,940
and not leave this balance there
 

915
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,570
and not leave this balance there
I can move his balance as I move his

916
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:08,580
I can move his balance as I move his
 

917
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,570
I can move his balance as I move his
whole body around you see

918
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:11,580
whole body around you see
 

919
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,690
whole body around you see
and that's where I could do my peel

920
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:14,700
and that's where I could do my peel
 

921
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,370
and that's where I could do my peel
and we're stuck

922
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,380
and we're stuck
 

923
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,950
and we're stuck
so here I won't move

924
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
so here I won't move
 

925
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,950
so here I won't move
I'm not grabbing tight

926
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:21,960
I'm not grabbing tight
 

927
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,010
I'm not grabbing tight
but if he pulls and I'm external I'll

928
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,020
but if he pulls and I'm external I'll
 

929
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,269
but if he pulls and I'm external I'll
have to pull back on him if I'm internal

930
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:28,279
have to pull back on him if I'm internal
 

931
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,769
have to pull back on him if I'm internal
then this won't

932
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:30,779
then this won't
 

933
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,470
then this won't
pull me this pulls him

934
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,480
pull me this pulls him
 

935
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,529
pull me this pulls him
do you get that so I'm just stuck here

936
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:36,539
do you get that so I'm just stuck here
 

937
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,830
do you get that so I'm just stuck here
stuck here stuck here

938
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
stuck here stuck here
 

939
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,110
stuck here stuck here
all that gets internalized and without

940
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,120
all that gets internalized and without
 

941
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,750
all that gets internalized and without
moving it moves him as he resists it

942
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:44,760
moving it moves him as he resists it
 

943
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,090
moving it moves him as he resists it
okay I'm not cranking on it you feel how

944
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,100
okay I'm not cranking on it you feel how
 

945
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,269
okay I'm not cranking on it you feel how
relaxed my hand is okay so same thing so

946
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:50,279
relaxed my hand is okay so same thing so
 

947
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,850
relaxed my hand is okay so same thing so
he can't pull his arm away

948
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:52,860
he can't pull his arm away
 

949
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,130
he can't pull his arm away
he'll lose his balance and I'm stuck to

950
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,140
he'll lose his balance and I'm stuck to
 

951
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,669
he'll lose his balance and I'm stuck to
him but you don't see me

952
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
him but you don't see me
 

953
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,450
him but you don't see me
bracing

954
00:25:59,450 --> 00:25:59,460
bracing
 

955
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,430
bracing
for the pull

956
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
for the pull
 

957
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,269
for the pull
you see that that'll have me pull

958
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:04,279
you see that that'll have me pull
 

959
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,909
you see that that'll have me pull
so as I come off oh we're in the ground

960
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919
so as I come off oh we're in the ground
 

961
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,430
so as I come off oh we're in the ground
we're in the ground now and that moves

962
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:10,440
we're in the ground now and that moves
 

963
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,669
we're in the ground now and that moves
him so as I move it moves in

964
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
him so as I move it moves in
 

965
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,430
him so as I move it moves in
as he moves it moves in

966
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:16,440
as he moves it moves in
 

967
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,950
as he moves it moves in
okay without me shifting

968
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
okay without me shifting
 

969
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,529
okay without me shifting
embracing against the pulling energy so

970
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:21,539
embracing against the pulling energy so
 

971
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,409
embracing against the pulling energy so
we're increasing the stress right

972
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:24,419
we're increasing the stress right
 

973
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,289
we're increasing the stress right
because ideally martially if you pulled

974
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:27,299
because ideally martially if you pulled
 

975
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,690
because ideally martially if you pulled
my arm I should go in with him do you

976
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:29,700
my arm I should go in with him do you
 

977
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,450
my arm I should go in with him do you
see but energetically I can increase the

978
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:32,460
see but energetically I can increase the
 

979
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,250
see but energetically I can increase the
stress and I'm neutralizing it

980
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,260
stress and I'm neutralizing it
 

981
00:26:34,260 --> 00:27:51,470
stress and I'm neutralizing it
internally okay try it

982
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:51,480

 

983
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,769

so both right she got out and you tugged

984
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:54,779
so both right she got out and you tugged
 

985
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:01,130
so both right she got out and you tugged
on her and it brought your base off

986
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,140

 

987
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,350

good same thing do you see that and

988
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,360
good same thing do you see that and
 

989
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,090
good same thing do you see that and
that's what will happen we'll lose our

990
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,100
that's what will happen we'll lose our
 

991
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,950
that's what will happen we'll lose our
base and we'll lose our connection right

992
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:09,960

 

993
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,570

good

994
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:14,580

 

995
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,870

will it increase again the stressor on

996
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:17,880
will it increase again the stressor on
 

997
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,149
will it increase again the stressor on
the udemy okay

998
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
the udemy okay
 

999
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,810
the udemy okay
so as I I have I have them in kazushi

1000
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:23,820
so as I I have I have them in kazushi
 

1001
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,350
so as I I have I have them in kazushi
right now internally I peel off here

1002
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
right now internally I peel off here
 

1003
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,350
right now internally I peel off here
we're stuck in an adhesion and I come

1004
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,360
we're stuck in an adhesion and I come
 

1005
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,409
we're stuck in an adhesion and I come
around okay so same thing if you look at

1006
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:33,419
around okay so same thing if you look at
 

1007
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,669
around okay so same thing if you look at
this arm trap it it is externally not

1008
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
this arm trap it it is externally not
 

1009
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,730
this arm trap it it is externally not
much of a trap you see that but this was

1010
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:40,740
much of a trap you see that but this was
 

1011
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,250
much of a trap you see that but this was
even less of a trap but because of that

1012
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,260
even less of a trap but because of that
 

1013
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,730
even less of a trap but because of that
Ike adhesion he's stuck you see so it

1014
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:46,740
Ike adhesion he's stuck you see so it
 

1015
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,130
Ike adhesion he's stuck you see so it
would be the same thing see as he tries

1016
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,140
would be the same thing see as he tries
 

1017
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,870
would be the same thing see as he tries
to pull it takes him off down but it's

1018
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
to pull it takes him off down but it's
 

1019
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,149
to pull it takes him off down but it's
not that I'm pulling on him I just

1020
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:53,159
not that I'm pulling on him I just
 

1021
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,330
not that I'm pulling on him I just
internalizing his energy okay so now

1022
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:56,340
internalizing his energy okay so now
 

1023
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,130
internalizing his energy okay so now
what we're going to do is we know we

1024
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,140
what we're going to do is we know we
 

1025
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,549
what we're going to do is we know we
have to ID me behind him right okay so

1026
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:01,559
have to ID me behind him right okay so
 

1027
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,210
have to ID me behind him right okay so
my weight my ground Vector is going to

1028
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:05,220
my weight my ground Vector is going to
 

1029
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,190
my weight my ground Vector is going to
change it's going to change onto this

1030
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,200
change it's going to change onto this
 

1031
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,070
change it's going to change onto this
foot over here okay and we'll exaggerate

1032
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080
foot over here okay and we'll exaggerate
 

1033
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,529
foot over here okay and we'll exaggerate
his pushing externally I would yield

1034
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:12,539
his pushing externally I would yield
 

1035
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,710
his pushing externally I would yield
here right but for uh cultivation

1036
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:15,720
here right but for uh cultivation
 

1037
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,830
here right but for uh cultivation
reasons and observational reasons uh you

1038
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:18,840
reasons and observational reasons uh you
 

1039
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,570
reasons and observational reasons uh you
can see I don't have a basis of sport

1040
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:20,580
can see I don't have a basis of sport
 

1041
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,669
can see I don't have a basis of sport
you see there's no base spot there okay

1042
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:22,679
you see there's no base spot there okay
 

1043
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,830
you see there's no base spot there okay
it's all grounding no different than

1044
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:24,840
it's all grounding no different than
 

1045
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,230
it's all grounding no different than
when I was on my toes it's all going

1046
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,240
when I was on my toes it's all going
 

1047
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,169
when I was on my toes it's all going
down you feel that okay so same thing I

1048
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:30,179
down you feel that okay so same thing I
 

1049
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,029
down you feel that okay so same thing I
will exaggerate as I come on one foot

1050
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:32,039
will exaggerate as I come on one foot
 

1051
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,310
will exaggerate as I come on one foot
he's he's pushing

1052
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
he's he's pushing
 

1053
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,630
he's he's pushing
go back

1054
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
go back
 

1055
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,029
go back
as I come on one foot I'll exaggerate it

1056
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:38,039
as I come on one foot I'll exaggerate it
 

1057
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,710
as I come on one foot I'll exaggerate it
doesn't matter that it's one foot he

1058
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:39,720
doesn't matter that it's one foot he
 

1059
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,090
doesn't matter that it's one foot he
still can't push

1060
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,100
still can't push
 

1061
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,789
still can't push
you still can't push me over okay and

1062
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:43,799
you still can't push me over okay and
 

1063
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,830
you still can't push me over okay and
that whole thing moves into his body

1064
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
that whole thing moves into his body
 

1065
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,090
that whole thing moves into his body
okay so I'll do it again

1066
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,100
okay so I'll do it again
 

1067
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,149
okay so I'll do it again
whoa you could test here hey can you

1068
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:53,159
whoa you could test here hey can you
 

1069
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,570
whoa you could test here hey can you
pull what happens to him right you come

1070
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:56,580
pull what happens to him right you come
 

1071
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,210
pull what happens to him right you come
in here same thing he goes to pull what

1072
00:29:59,210 --> 00:29:59,220
in here same thing he goes to pull what
 

1073
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,029
in here same thing he goes to pull what
happens to him I can exaggerate the

1074
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:02,039
happens to him I can exaggerate the
 

1075
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,430
happens to him I can exaggerate the
ground Vector over here he's pushing

1076
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,440
ground Vector over here he's pushing
 

1077
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,070
ground Vector over here he's pushing
with no base of support and I can

1078
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,080
with no base of support and I can
 

1079
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,230
with no base of support and I can
exaggerate the ground vector by

1080
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:09,240
exaggerate the ground vector by
 

1081
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,230
exaggerate the ground vector by
compromising my base entirely now we're

1082
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
compromising my base entirely now we're
 

1083
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,730
compromising my base entirely now we're
still stuck

1084
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:13,740
still stuck
 

1085
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,610
still stuck
that still adhesion is still there so

1086
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:16,620
that still adhesion is still there so
 

1087
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,649
that still adhesion is still there so
when I move I move to take him into the

1088
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:21,659
when I move I move to take him into the
 

1089
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,049
when I move I move to take him into the
kazushi pattern do you see it you see

1090
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:24,059
kazushi pattern do you see it you see
 

1091
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,510
kazushi pattern do you see it you see
what happened to his body okay it's not

1092
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:26,520
what happened to his body okay it's not
 

1093
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,850
what happened to his body okay it's not
that he's there then I go here and then

1094
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:28,860
that he's there then I go here and then
 

1095
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,070
that he's there then I go here and then
take him

1096
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,080
take him
 

1097
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,830
take him
he's pushing on me as I come around push

1098
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
he's pushing on me as I come around push
 

1099
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,130
he's pushing on me as I come around push
hard as I come around I use the adhesion

1100
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,140
hard as I come around I use the adhesion
 

1101
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,789
hard as I come around I use the adhesion
to take him into the kazushi powder

1102
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
to take him into the kazushi powder
 

1103
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,810
to take him into the kazushi powder
okay

1104
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:41,820
okay
 

1105
00:30:41,820 --> 00:31:40,750
okay
try it

1106
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:40,760

 

1107
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,730

foreign

1108
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:42,740
foreign
 

1109
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,049
foreign
yeah there do you see

1110
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:45,059
yeah there do you see
 

1111
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,389
yeah there do you see
so that was the external

1112
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:47,399
so that was the external
 

1113
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,190
so that was the external
base

1114
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
base
 

1115
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,169
base
and so she's able to manipulate it

1116
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:51,179
and so she's able to manipulate it
 

1117
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,570
and so she's able to manipulate it
because she has the mechanical advantage

1118
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:53,580
because she has the mechanical advantage
 

1119
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,789
because she has the mechanical advantage
no base of support back there right

1120
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:55,799
no base of support back there right
 

1121
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,730
no base of support back there right
continue we'll let you passed it

1122
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:58,740
continue we'll let you passed it
 

1123
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,010
continue we'll let you passed it
and then you keep driving vouching and

1124
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,020
and then you keep driving vouching and
 

1125
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,870
and then you keep driving vouching and
you'll see you'll never get that foot in

1126
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
you'll see you'll never get that foot in
 

1127
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,750
you'll see you'll never get that foot in
edemy

1128
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760

 

1129
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,169

yes do you see

1130
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:09,179

 

1131
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,909

driving into that bad biomechanics

1132
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:13,919
driving into that bad biomechanics
 

1133
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:22,070
driving into that bad biomechanics
yes there you go do you see

1134
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080

 

1135
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,289

so there we muscled her do you see do

1136
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:24,299
so there we muscled her do you see do
 

1137
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,830
so there we muscled her do you see do
you get that

1138
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:27,840

 

1139
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,690

so all

1140
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:29,700
so all
 

1141
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,330
so all
all stressors increase in stress you see

1142
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:32,340
all stressors increase in stress you see
 

1143
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,430
all stressors increase in stress you see
it's such a level of stress that for

1144
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:34,440
it's such a level of stress that for
 

1145
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,490
it's such a level of stress that for
your levels it the adaptation is so

1146
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:37,500
your levels it the adaptation is so
 

1147
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,289
your levels it the adaptation is so
needed you're not going to cultivate it

1148
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:39,299
needed you're not going to cultivate it
 

1149
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,269
needed you're not going to cultivate it
there do you see that but it does show

1150
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
there do you see that but it does show
 

1151
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,029
there do you see that but it does show
that you can test for the adaptation you

1152
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:44,039
that you can test for the adaptation you
 

1153
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,370
that you can test for the adaptation you
see as you increase the stress or at

1154
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,380
see as you increase the stress or at
 

1155
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,649
see as you increase the stress or at
least the quality of the adaptation okay

1156
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:48,659
least the quality of the adaptation okay
 

1157
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,810
least the quality of the adaptation okay
but I would also put in there the

1158
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:50,820
but I would also put in there the
 

1159
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,049
but I would also put in there the
presence of any of it okay you can do

1160
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:54,059
presence of any of it okay you can do
 

1161
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,250
presence of any of it okay you can do
that

1162
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,260
that

first technique he will come up off the
 

1217
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,530
first technique he will come up off the
ground and he will fall into the same

ground and he will fall into the same
 

1219
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,290
ground and he will fall into the same
technique in very much the same exact

technique in very much the same exact
 

1221

technique in very much the same exact
position pattern as the first technique

1222
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
position pattern as the first technique
 

1223
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,030
position pattern as the first technique
did you guys see that okay give it a

1224
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,040
did you guys see that okay give it a
