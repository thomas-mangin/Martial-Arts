00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,440
last post uh he's going to go into
 

9
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,030
last post uh he's going to go into
shenai when he does this lift so that

10
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
shenai when he does this lift so that
 

11
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,070
shenai when he does this lift so that
and he's going to wait the bar on his

12
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,080
and he's going to wait the bar on his
 

13
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,630
and he's going to wait the bar on his
midfoot the entire time okay so first we

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
midfoot the entire time okay so first we
 

15
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,109
midfoot the entire time okay so first we
have to uh learn a couple

16
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
have to uh learn a couple
 

17
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,189
have to uh learn a couple
things um we want how wide is our grip

18
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
things um we want how wide is our grip
 

19
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,070
things um we want how wide is our grip
okay so your grip is going to be uh as

20
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
okay so your grip is going to be uh as
 

21
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,070
okay so your grip is going to be uh as
you address the bar you'll come in make

22
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
you address the bar you'll come in make
 

23
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,150
you address the bar you'll come in make
sure you align your nose on the center

24
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
sure you align your nose on the center
 

25
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,069
sure you align your nose on the center
of the bar between those inner nerling

26
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
of the bar between those inner nerling
 

27
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,430
of the bar between those inner nerling
marks your spine too and you just walk

28
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
marks your spine too and you just walk
 

29
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,069
marks your spine too and you just walk
in and then here we want our forearms

30
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:41,079
in and then here we want our forearms
 

31
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,790
in and then here we want our forearms
straight up and down so if the forearms

32
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
straight up and down so if the forearms
 

33
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,270
straight up and down so if the forearms
are out and you get that kind of

34
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,280
are out and you get that kind of
 

35
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,549
are out and you get that kind of
diagonal it's not going to it's too far

36
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
diagonal it's not going to it's too far
 

37
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,670
diagonal it's not going to it's too far
out if they're angled in it's too far in

38
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
out if they're angled in it's too far in
 

39
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,430
out if they're angled in it's too far in
and so A good rule of thumb for your

40
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,440
and so A good rule of thumb for your
 

41
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,389
and so A good rule of thumb for your
forearms being vertical is going to be

42
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:57,399
forearms being vertical is going to be
 

43
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,229
forearms being vertical is going to be
there in alignment with your shoulders

44
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
there in alignment with your shoulders
 

45
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,430
there in alignment with your shoulders
right with your should shoulders they're

46
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,440
right with your should shoulders they're

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,869
right with your should shoulders they're
not out of your shoulders and they're

48
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:01,879
not out of your shoulders and they're
 

49
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,830
not out of your shoulders and they're
not in of your shoulders right with your

50
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
not in of your shoulders right with your
 

51

00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
shoulders
 

53
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,630
shoulders
okay uh so you grab first center

54
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:07,640
okay uh so you grab first center
 

55
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,550
okay uh so you grab first center
yourself on the bar get your grip even

make sure you stay centered so he'll
 

63
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,990
make sure you stay centered so he'll
work his way in and then he has his

knees
bent and he's under the bar he's a

68
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,640
bent and he's under the bar he's a
 

69
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,270
bent and he's under the bar he's a
little more forward of the bar cuz we

70
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
little more forward of the bar cuz we
 

71
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,910
little more forward of the bar cuz we
don't want to use our shoulders to get

72
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
don't want to use our shoulders to get
 

73

the weight off we're going to use our

74
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
the weight off we're going to use our
 

75
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,670
the weight off we're going to use our
whole

76

whole
 

77
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,190
whole
structure now he straightens his knees

structure now he straightens his knees
 

79
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,389
structure now he straightens his knees
and the bar is up okay you take one to

80
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:37,399
and the bar is up okay you take one to
 

81
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,990
and the bar is up okay you take one to
two steps off back from the rack here we

82
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,000
two steps off back from the rack here we
 

83
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,990
two steps off back from the rack here we
have a chin up bar so you're just trying

84
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,000
have a chin up bar so you're just trying
 

85

to step to clear it the goal here is not
 

87
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,030
to step to clear it the goal here is not
to take a lot of steps because you

to take a lot of steps because you
 

89
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,469
to take a lot of steps because you
should be lifting heavy and we don't

90

he goes back and down straight up on
that midfoot Vector back

160

that midfoot Vector back
 

161
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,750
that midfoot Vector back
