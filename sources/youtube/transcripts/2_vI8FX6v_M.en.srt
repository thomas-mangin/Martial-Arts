the timing okay so he's pushing i'll

62
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
the timing okay so he's pushing i'll
 

63
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,030
the timing okay so he's pushing i'll
yield

64
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
yield
 

65
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,950
yield
and my strike will come out

66
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
and my strike will come out
 

67
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,510
and my strike will come out
okay he's gonna not play the victim so

68
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
okay he's gonna not play the victim so
 

69
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,469
okay he's gonna not play the victim so
he's gonna get his check up there

70
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
he's gonna get his check up there
 

71
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,390
he's gonna get his check up there
but it's it's not this

it's it's here he goes to attack it
 

75
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,270
it's it's here he goes to attack it
and the strike comes out okay move your

76
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
and the strike comes out okay move your
 

77
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,109
and the strike comes out okay move your
hand out of the way this is a back

78
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119

back level to the temple and you're
 

83
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,789
back level to the temple and you're
checking

84
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
checking
 

85
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,830
checking
the other arm at the elbow or above not

86
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
the other arm at the elbow or above not
 

87
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,350
the other arm at the elbow or above not
below because it's free to do things

88
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
below because it's free to do things
 

89
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,830
below because it's free to do things
so he hits a clue and you hit

90

00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280

 

95
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,310

so

96
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
so
 

97
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,749
so
here i have

98
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
here i have
 

99
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,310
here i have
what is called open-ended triangles down

100
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
what is called open-ended triangles down
 

101
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,870
what is called open-ended triangles down
below and when i come back up i have

102
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
below and when i come back up i have
 

103
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,429
below and when i come back up i have
open-ended triangles now at chew down

104
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
open-ended triangles now at chew down
 

105
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,270
open-ended triangles now at chew down
level

106
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
level
 

107
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,589
level
so opening the triangles

108
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
so opening the triangles
 

109
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,110
so opening the triangles
give me your hand please

110
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
give me your hand please
 

111
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,790
give me your hand please
okay

112
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
okay
 

113
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,470
okay
open into triangles

114
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
open into triangles
 

115
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,949
open into triangles
so an open-ended triangle

116
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
so an open-ended triangle
 

117
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,910
so an open-ended triangle
is

118
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
is
 

119
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,830
is
uh i'm going to have about four or five

120
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
uh i'm going to have about four or five
 

121
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,830
uh i'm going to have about four or five
of them so taylor will come trace them

122
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
of them so taylor will come trace them
 

123
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,070
of them so taylor will come trace them
and you move out of the picture okay and

124
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
and you move out of the picture okay and
 

125
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,670
and you move out of the picture okay and
i'll bring my arms together so you can

126
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
i'll bring my arms together so you can
 

127
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,790
i'll bring my arms together so you can
see

128
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
see
 

129
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,830
see
one

130
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
one
 

131
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,790
one
good

132
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
good
 

133
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,430
good

i'm going to use this trap
 

155
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,070
i'm going to use this trap
to capture that arm

156
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
to capture that arm
 

157
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,750
to capture that arm
like a venus fly trap it closes
