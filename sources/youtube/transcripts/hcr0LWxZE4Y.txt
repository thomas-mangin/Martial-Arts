when we begin here feet on the ground

the worst thing in the world but work to
get those heels down okay from this
position reach up and over like I'm
reaching for something over that way
other side up

asymmetry in this right meeting my right

right
sitting flapping with your shin box
position so box position is one
foot in front like this back foot out
toe pointing out right so money this
book is out like this it's like a little
kid watch TV unfortunately so
relax my hip here and let my foot sit
out or my leg sit down here wall my hips
relaxing I'm not doing any of this in my
day all in my hip right so let's drink
is happening buddy hip breaking quite
done yet good sitting there straight
it's a hip out is already nice and warm
right now good time to stretch good your
fianc right now I'm leaning into that
hip a little bit trying to get more hip
straight I feel zero pressure on my knee
feel everything in my hip I don't want
strike out my hip
good other side reverse our chin tuck
position this foot out front its leg out
stretch in here nothing in my tank
everything in my hip yeah your knees
hurting bring the pressure off of it
however you need to right so you wanna
bring the pressure off of that knee so
all the stretch is in your hip
yeah all right
with no medication here we're gonna do
looks like about eight minutes and 39
seconds
so we'll medicate a little longer than
this goes off so somewhere around ten
minutes probably okay
so nice relaxed position we're gonna do
another observational meditation it's
hardest for your mind let go of
everything so just be now and in the
moment thoughts are going to arise
that's fine it's natural perfectly cool
let them arise let them leave
that's what thoughts do don't put any
effort into the thought don't follow the
thought allow your mind to be here now
this is relatively easy in lots of ways
when you're doing this you have to
juggle a bunch of stuff but you know
when you're freaked out your mind's
anxious and trying to make all kinds of
stuff happen this is a useful skill to
be able to have so it's relatively easy
to practice in a calm situation like
this some ways it's hard because you'll
have something else to focus on which
which helps but learning to control your
mind from here will help you control
your mind and lots of other situations
so seated meditation we're gonna do
probably a little less than 10 minutes
three bills and three bills out here we
go
[Music]
you

okey guys so that's it for today I will
see you on Thursday have a good one
