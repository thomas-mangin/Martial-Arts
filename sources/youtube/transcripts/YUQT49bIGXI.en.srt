00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479

 

73
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,510

this is me moving my head legs and

74
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
this is me moving my head legs and
 

75
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,230
this is me moving my head legs and
hands i don't want that i don't want

76
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
hands i don't want that i don't want
 

77
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,469
hands i don't want that i don't want
consciousness in them

78
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
consciousness in them
 

79
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:25,990
consciousness in them
i want my effort my intention in here

80
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000

 

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,470

okay let's try it

82
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480

 

83
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,630

so you're consciously moving your head

84
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
so you're consciously moving your head
 

85
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,309
so you're consciously moving your head
your head is relaxed

86
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319

 

87
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:52,390

but you see it's stuck do you see that

88
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400

 

89
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,670

that's your legs

90
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680

 

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,309

so your feet are right now not connected

92
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
so your feet are right now not connected
 

93
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:24,630
so your feet are right now not connected
to your center

94
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,110

that that's a conscious movement of your

96
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
that that's a conscious movement of your
 

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,670
that that's a conscious movement of your
upper

98
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
upper
 

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,990
upper
shoulders and neck area which is why it

100
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
shoulders and neck area which is why it
 

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,830
shoulders and neck area which is why it
moved

102
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
moved
 

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:49,910
moved
don't you don't move your extremities

104
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920

 

105
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,670

now the next drill

106
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
now the next drill
 

107
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,509
now the next drill
is taking you more and more

108
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
is taking you more and more
 

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,429
is taking you more and more
into the religious overlay so

110
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
into the religious overlay so
 

111
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,670
into the religious overlay so
i do have to have this relationship

112
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
i do have to have this relationship
 

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,350
i do have to have this relationship
so that i generate order

114
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360

 

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,750

here represented by the extremities to

116
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
here represented by the extremities to
 

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,309
here represented by the extremities to
my center

118
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
my center
 

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,069
my center
but ultimately there's going to be a

120
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
but ultimately there's going to be a
 

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,430
but ultimately there's going to be a
center

122
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440

 

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,469

to my relationship with okay

124
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
to my relationship with okay
 

125
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,469
to my relationship with okay
in other words there's going to be order

126
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479

 

127
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,189

and there's going to be order to how i

128
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
and there's going to be order to how i
 

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,590
and there's going to be order to how i
fall

130
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600

 

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,710

and all of those things are cultivation

132
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
and all of those things are cultivation
 

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,710
and all of those things are cultivation
arenas by which i either succumb to

134
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
arenas by which i either succumb to
 

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,550
arenas by which i either succumb to
the fear or i stay in the iq

136
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
the fear or i stay in the iq
 

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,310
the fear or i stay in the iq
okay so we're going to start generating

138
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
okay so we're going to start generating
 

139
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,870
okay so we're going to start generating
um the spiraling

140
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880

 

141
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,749

aspect to this center periphery

142
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
aspect to this center periphery
 

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,150
aspect to this center periphery
organization

144
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160

 

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,189

so i'm going to open my feet up

146
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
so i'm going to open my feet up
 

147
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,749
so i'm going to open my feet up
and i still right now i establish i'm

148
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
and i still right now i establish i'm
 

149
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,590
and i still right now i establish i'm
going to establish the order

150
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
going to establish the order
 

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,430
going to establish the order
okay and i'll first do disorder

152
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
okay and i'll first do disorder
 

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,550
okay and i'll first do disorder
so when i'm sitting like this

154
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
so when i'm sitting like this
 

155
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,749
so when i'm sitting like this
okay see my upper body is not related to

156
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
okay see my upper body is not related to
 

157
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,590
okay see my upper body is not related to
my feet

158
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
my feet
 

159
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,230
my feet
i'm going to use that percussive moment

160
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
i'm going to use that percussive moment
 

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,110
i'm going to use that percussive moment
of flexion

162
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
of flexion
 

163
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,390
of flexion
of the last drill to

164
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
of the last drill to
 

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,430
of the last drill to
prolong the order

166
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
prolong the order
 

167
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,110
prolong the order
here not like this

168
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
here not like this
 

169
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,870
here not like this
this disconnected order

170
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
this disconnected order
 

171
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,029
this disconnected order
and i'm going to pay attention to the

172
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
and i'm going to pay attention to the
 

173
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,310
and i'm going to pay attention to the
relationship between my head and feet

174
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
relationship between my head and feet
 

175
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,189
relationship between my head and feet
so i'm going like this my feet don't

176
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
so i'm going like this my feet don't
 

177
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,749
so i'm going like this my feet don't
move

178
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
move
 

179

circle
 

195
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,510
circle
and this is also going to give the new

196
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
and this is also going to give the new
 

197
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,670
and this is also going to give the new
student

198
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
student
 

199
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,870
student
the hand foot coordination

200
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
the hand foot coordination
 

201
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,150
the hand foot coordination
of the later break falls okay so

202
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
of the later break falls okay so
 

203
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,270
of the later break falls okay so
as my head goes down

204
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
as my head goes down
 

205
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,270
as my head goes down
and to my right the left leg is going to

and to my right the left leg is going to
 

207
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,550
and to my right the left leg is going to
stay in that relationship so left head

208
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
stay in that relationship so left head
 

209
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,350
stay in that relationship so left head

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
head and right hand okay so disorganized
 

213
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,870
head and right hand okay so disorganized
would be like this

214
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880

 

215
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,110

organizes it goes together

216
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120

 

217
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,670

and i'm using this to get up and to go

218
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
and i'm using this to get up and to go
 

219
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,150
and i'm using this to get up and to go
down

220
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
down
 

221
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,670
down
to get up and to go down so we'll do one

222
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
to get up and to go down so we'll do one
 

223
00:06:51,680 --> 00:07:02,950
to get up and to go down so we'll do one
way i'm going around boom the pattern is

224
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
way i'm going around boom the pattern is
 

225
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,070
way i'm going around boom the pattern is
hand hand foot foot hand

226
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
hand hand foot foot hand
 

227
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,189
hand hand foot foot hand
hand foot foot you go and then you want

228
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
hand foot foot you go and then you want
 

229
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,309
hand foot foot you go and then you want
to go the other way

230
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
to go the other way
 

231
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:21,110
to go the other way
hand hand foot foot

232
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120

 

233
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,629

your head stays in that relationship

234
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
your head stays in that relationship
 

235
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,670
your head stays in that relationship
with your feet in this relationship so

236
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
with your feet in this relationship so
 

237
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,510
with your feet in this relationship so
you see where my head is

238
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
you see where my head is
 

239
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,469
you see where my head is
stays there

240
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
in
 

245
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,869
in
okay let's try that

246
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879

 

247
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,830

so right there you you felt that little

248
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
so right there you you felt that little
 

249
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,710
so right there you you felt that little
right there

250
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
right there
 

251
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,869
right there
do you feel that yes okay so that looks

252
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
do you feel that yes okay so that looks
 

253
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,950
do you feel that yes okay so that looks
like strength to me

254
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
like strength to me
 

255
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,189
like strength to me
okay so we we have to condition to get

256
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
okay so we we have to condition to get
 

257
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,469
okay so we we have to condition to get
rid of that

258
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
rid of that
 

259
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,309
rid of that
there's no point in asking you

260
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
there's no point in asking you
 

261
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,469
there's no point in asking you
spiritually to remain ordered

262
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
spiritually to remain ordered
 

263
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,510
spiritually to remain ordered
if physically you cannot okay

264
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
if physically you cannot okay
 

265
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,510
if physically you cannot okay
but there's not really that much

266
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
but there's not really that much
 

267
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,749
but there's not really that much
strength in this drill

268
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759

you can use your you can counter yeah

272
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
you can use your you can counter yeah
 

273
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,710
you can use your you can counter yeah
you're counter weighting

274
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
you're counter weighting
 

275
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,110
you're counter weighting
okay so really what's happening before

276
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
okay so really what's happening before
 

277
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,070
okay so really what's happening before
you

278

you
 

279
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,070
you
have that strength requirement is you

280
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
have that strength requirement is you
 

281
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,430
have that strength requirement is you
disconnected

and kill a couple birds with one's stone
 

357
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,550
and kill a couple birds with one's stone
so the first one i'm going to use is uh

358
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
so the first one i'm going to use is uh
 

359
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,030
so the first one i'm going to use is uh
cesa it says not

360
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
cesa it says not
 

361
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,870
cesa it says not
disconnect like this okay cesar is

362
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
disconnect like this okay cesar is
 

363
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,389
disconnect like this okay cesar is
already

364
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
already
 

365
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,590
already
that organization in play

366
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
that organization in play
 

367
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,630
that organization in play
you're already learning and doing and

368
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
you're already learning and doing and
 

369
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,990
you're already learning and doing and
practicing

370
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
practicing
 

371
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,949
practicing
the very body organization that you're

372
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
the very body organization that you're
 

373
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,269
the very body organization that you're
using in your nagewasa and of course

374
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
using in your nagewasa and of course
 

375
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,069
using in your nagewasa and of course
in your campaign so you're already in

376
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
in your campaign so you're already in
 

377
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,509
in your campaign so you're already in
that relationship

378
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
that relationship
 

379
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,190
that relationship
so we're going to now extend that

380
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
so we're going to now extend that
 

381
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,829
so we're going to now extend that
relationship and take one component of

382
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
relationship and take one component of
 

383
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,630
relationship and take one component of
the last

384
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
the last
 

385
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,590
the last
drill and i'm going to relate and

386
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
drill and i'm going to relate and
 

387
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,069
drill and i'm going to relate and
generate that order by relating my

388
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
generate that order by relating my
 

389
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,030
generate that order by relating my
head to my foot so i'm going to take my

390
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
head to my foot so i'm going to take my
 

391
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,670
head to my foot so i'm going to take my
head

392
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
head
 

393
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,710
head
left foot right hand okay and

394
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
left foot right hand okay and
 

395
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,269
left foot right hand okay and
do one portion and start to learn this

396
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
do one portion and start to learn this
 

397
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,230
do one portion and start to learn this
back break fall

398
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
back break fall
 

399
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,990
back break fall
okay but it's key that i'm not

400
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
okay but it's key that i'm not
 

401
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,949
okay but it's key that i'm not
disconnecting not over tension

402
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
disconnecting not over tension
 

403
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,509
disconnecting not over tension
everything is just my body and i'm going

404
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
everything is just my body and i'm going
 

405
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,670
everything is just my body and i'm going
to experience

406
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
to experience
 

407
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,470
to experience
a slight feeling of falling and this is

408
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
a slight feeling of falling and this is
 

409
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,910
a slight feeling of falling and this is
where that fear comes in

410
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
where that fear comes in
 

411
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,710
where that fear comes in
and the disorganization comes in okay

412
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
and the disorganization comes in okay
 

413
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,949
and the disorganization comes in okay
but you were already falling in the last

414
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
but you were already falling in the last
 

415
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,590
but you were already falling in the last
row

416
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
row
 

417
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,829
row
so use your imagination to make this

418
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
so use your imagination to make this
 

419
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,910
so use your imagination to make this
drill like the last row

420
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
drill like the last row
 

421
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,310
drill like the last row
we're going to do back breakfall uh

422
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
we're going to do back breakfall uh
 

423
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,629
we're going to do back breakfall uh
mechanics starting with the right side

424
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
mechanics starting with the right side
 

425
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,269
mechanics starting with the right side
okay

426
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
okay
 

427
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,389
okay
so as my body comes out my head is

428
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
so as my body comes out my head is
 

429
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,670
so as my body comes out my head is
moving my leg will come out and this

430
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
moving my leg will come out and this
 

431
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,550
moving my leg will come out and this
would be

432
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
would be
 

433
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,389
would be
if i continue the last drill

434
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399

 

435
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,829

incorrect would be this you can see i'm

436
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
incorrect would be this you can see i'm
 

437
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,350
incorrect would be this you can see i'm
segmented

438
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
segmented
 

439
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,430
segmented
so from cesa sliding out

440
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
so from cesa sliding out
 

441
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:55,190
so from cesa sliding out
lock tension won't out

442
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200

 

443
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,670

my eyes will remain forward and i will

444
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
my eyes will remain forward and i will
 

445
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,430
my eyes will remain forward and i will
end with my head off the mat

446
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
end with my head off the mat
 

447
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,069
end with my head off the mat
and my feet up out

448
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
and my feet up out
 

449
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,110
and my feet up out
i get up i'm reversing that organization

450
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
i get up i'm reversing that organization
 

451
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,310
i get up i'm reversing that organization
out when i get up

452
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
out when i get up
 

453
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,150
out when i get up
i'm using it

454
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160

 

455
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,389

to get up

456
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
to get up
 

457
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,190
to get up
from there you can uh introduce the

458
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
from there you can uh introduce the
 

459
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,269
from there you can uh introduce the
timing aspects of hitting the mat so

460
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
timing aspects of hitting the mat so
 

461
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,550
timing aspects of hitting the mat so
i'll do the same thing

462
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
i'll do the same thing
 

463
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:39,920
i'll do the same thing
out hands back in

464
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:39,930

 

465
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,110

[Music]

466
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120

 

467
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,230

okay let's try that do both sides

468
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
okay let's try that do both sides
 

469
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,910
okay let's try that do both sides
okay in the first drill we had an on off

470
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
okay in the first drill we had an on off
 

471
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,990
okay in the first drill we had an on off
aspect to our center and the second

472
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
aspect to our center and the second
 

473
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,590
aspect to our center and the second
drill i kept it on

474
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
drill i kept it on
 

475
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,829
drill i kept it on
in this last drill i keep it on and

476
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
in this last drill i keep it on and
 

477
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,910
in this last drill i keep it on and
we're going to keep it on

478
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
we're going to keep it on
 

479
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,110
we're going to keep it on
um for a while because

480
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
um for a while because
 

481
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,110
um for a while because
that's the best way of teaching someone

482
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
that's the best way of teaching someone
 

483
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,470
that's the best way of teaching someone
but what we're going to do is start

484
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
but what we're going to do is start
 

485
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,430
but what we're going to do is start
seeking height

486
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
seeking height
 

487
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,470
seeking height
you seek height fear comes in you're

488
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
you seek height fear comes in you're
 

489
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,069
you seek height fear comes in you're
going to lose the order

490
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
going to lose the order
 

491
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,310
going to lose the order
and you're not doing you can be okay so

492
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
and you're not doing you can be okay so
 

493
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,189
and you're not doing you can be okay so

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
i now teaching the back leg which is
 

499
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,509
i now teaching the back leg which is
what we use

500
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
what we use
 

501
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,710
what we use
to step into this spiraling geometry

502
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
to step into this spiraling geometry
 

503
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,910
to step into this spiraling geometry
that's going to be

504
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
that's going to be
 

505
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,350
that's going to be
used to throw me okay so both these are

506
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
used to throw me okay so both these are
 

507
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,150
used to throw me okay so both these are
on the mat

but i'm going to do the same head and
leg relationship

526
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
leg relationship
 

527
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,829
leg relationship
as i'm going out i keep my eyes forward

528
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
as i'm going out i keep my eyes forward
 

529
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,949
as i'm going out i keep my eyes forward
out use the same exercise to get

530
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
out use the same exercise to get
 

531
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,710
out use the same exercise to get
up reset the drill so the beginner feels

532
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
up reset the drill so the beginner feels
 

533
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,590
up reset the drill so the beginner feels

freak them out but obviously they're
still touching the mat

540

still touching the mat
 

541
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,110
still touching the mat
okay i do the same drill head starts to

542
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
okay i do the same drill head starts to
 

543
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,430
okay i do the same drill head starts to
go

544
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
go
 

545
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:26,949

leg comes out

546
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
leg comes out
 

547
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,910
leg comes out
okay let's try that one most of us okay

548
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
okay let's try that one most of us okay
 

549
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,030
okay let's try that one most of us okay
next drill you take

550
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
next drill you take
 

551
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,710
next drill you take
one leg up one leg up and it's the same

552
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
one leg up one leg up and it's the same
 

553
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,189
one leg up one leg up and it's the same
drop

554
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199

 

555
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,350

one leg up

556
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360

 

557
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,389

and this leg is lowering the head so

558
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
and this leg is lowering the head so
 

559
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,389
and this leg is lowering the head so
i'm not falling and picking the leg up

560
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
i'm not falling and picking the leg up
 

561
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,069
i'm not falling and picking the leg up
there's doing both

562
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
there's doing both
 

563
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,829
there's doing both
yes the legs coming up because the

564
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
yes the legs coming up because the
 

565
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,749
yes the legs coming up because the
head's going down but the leg is helping

566
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
head's going down but the leg is helping
 

567
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,749
head's going down but the leg is helping
to lower the head through the organized

568
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
to lower the head through the organized
 

569
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,710
to lower the head through the organized
center

570
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720

 

571
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,829

okay let's try it mostly okay uh

572
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
okay let's try it mostly okay uh
 

573
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,949
okay let's try it mostly okay uh
this one both knees are up

574
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
this one both knees are up
 

575
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,990
this one both knees are up
i have that same box center goes down

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
i have that same box center goes down
 

577
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:22,480
i have that same box center goes down
the same way

578
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,490
the same way

some errors come in because the momentum
 

583
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,189
some errors come in because the momentum
is going to increase

584
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
is going to increase
 

585
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,990
is going to increase
and uh these are not martial and again

586
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
and uh these are not martial and again

this disorder is disconnect
so you're gonna go you'll see the extra

592
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
so you're gonna go you'll see the extra
 

593
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,350
so you're gonna go you'll see the extra

and you'll give your back don't give

596
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
and you'll give your back don't give
 

597

and you'll give your back don't give
your back as you get

598
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920

 

599
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,150

same cesa upper body posture

600
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160

 

601
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,110

still oriented this way still in this

602
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
still oriented this way still in this
 

603
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,390
still oriented this way still in this
l-shape to the line of attack okay

604
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
l-shape to the line of attack okay
 

605
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,949
l-shape to the line of attack okay
let's try both sides okay so what you've

606
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
let's try both sides okay so what you've
 

607
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,029
let's try both sides okay so what you've
done pedagogically is you've taken the

608
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
done pedagogically is you've taken the
 

609
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,309
done pedagogically is you've taken the
second drill

610
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
second drill
 

611
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,429
second drill
and you've just used it to try to

612
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
and you've just used it to try to
 

613
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,429
and you've just used it to try to
reconcile fear in the student as they're

614
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
reconcile fear in the student as they're
 

615
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,230
reconcile fear in the student as they're
going along

616
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
going along
 

617
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,909
going along
okay uh now we're going to start

618
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
okay uh now we're going to start
 

619
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,309
okay uh now we're going to start
standing but i have my feet in keys of

620
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
standing but i have my feet in keys of
 

621
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,230
standing but i have my feet in keys of
the last row

622
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
the last row
 

623
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,230
the last row
right now some people start freaking out

624
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
right now some people start freaking out
 

625
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,309
right now some people start freaking out
so you go no no it's like the last drill

626
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
so you go no no it's like the last drill
 

627
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,990
so you go no no it's like the last drill
you just go down

628
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
you just go down
 

629
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,350
you just go down
and do it

630
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360

 

631
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,950

boom open your knees drop center lock

632
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960

 

633
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,870

usually at this point you'll see the

634
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
usually at this point you'll see the
 

635
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,710
usually at this point you'll see the
beginner mistake but you'll see that a

636
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
beginner mistake but you'll see that a
 

637
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,789
beginner mistake but you'll see that a
lot of schools will

638
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
lot of schools will
 

639
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,549
lot of schools will
make this maybe intentionally even

640
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
make this maybe intentionally even
 

641
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,270
make this maybe intentionally even
because as they go down this leg's going

642
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
because as they go down this leg's going
 

643
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,350
because as they go down this leg's going
to roll in

644
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
to roll in
 

645
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,350
to roll in
and this is now going to keep their head

646
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
and this is now going to keep their head
 

647
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,830
and this is now going to keep their head
on the line of attack

648
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840

 

649
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,549

that doesn't work run

650
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559

 

651
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,830

because the back right ball kazushi

652
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
because the back right ball kazushi
 

653
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,430
because the back right ball kazushi
is on this spiral here it's not on this

654
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
is on this spiral here it's not on this
 

655
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,110
is on this spiral here it's not on this
one

656
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
one
 

657
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,870
one
oh i'm doing it he's going this way

658
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880

 

659
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,830

and as i said there's a lot a larger

660
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840
and as i said there's a lot a larger
 

661
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,870
and as i said there's a lot a larger
order there's the order

662
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
order there's the order
 

663
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,230
order there's the order
between his body periphery center

664
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
between his body periphery center
 

665
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,870
between his body periphery center
then the order between he and i and the

666
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
then the order between he and i and the
 

667
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,710
then the order between he and i and the
order between he and i

668
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
order between he and i
 

669
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,430
order between he and i
the attack and the throne okay so you

670
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
the attack and the throne okay so you
 

671
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,070
the attack and the throne okay so you
can't just

672
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
can't just
 

673
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,350
can't just
fall in the old way you have to

674
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
fall in the old way you have to
 

675
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,390
fall in the old way you have to
maintain this organization alright so as

676
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
maintain this organization alright so as
 

677
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,630
maintain this organization alright so as
i'm doing this drill

678
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
i'm doing this drill
 

679
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,590
i'm doing this drill
i open and i do the last drill the knee

680
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
i open and i do the last drill the knee
 

681
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:02,390
i open and i do the last drill the knee
goes this way

682
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400

 

683
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,789

okay let's try both sides so

684
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
okay let's try both sides so
 

685
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,310
okay let's try both sides so
pedagogically i'm only

686
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
pedagogically i'm only
 

687
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,110
pedagogically i'm only
uh i'm only inserting the illusion of

688
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
uh i'm only inserting the illusion of
 

689
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,750
uh i'm only inserting the illusion of
height

690
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
height
 

691
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,590
height
because it drops down to the same other

692
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
because it drops down to the same other
 

693
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,750
because it drops down to the same other
level but it is enough to start

694
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
level but it is enough to start
 

695
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,310
level but it is enough to start
generating fear in the intestine now i'm

696
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
generating fear in the intestine now i'm
 

697
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,909
generating fear in the intestine now i'm
going to enter

698
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
going to enter
 

699
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,070
going to enter
introduce the illusion of momentum okay

700
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
introduce the illusion of momentum okay
 

701
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,230
introduce the illusion of momentum okay
so i'm going to have them start with the

702
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
so i'm going to have them start with the
 

703
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,390
so i'm going to have them start with the
right foot forward

704
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
right foot forward
 

705
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,590
right foot forward
take one step back into the last row

706
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
take one step back into the last row
 

707
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,870
take one step back into the last row
go down

708
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880

 

709
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,830

and do the same last row so it's one

710
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
and do the same last row so it's one
 

711
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,470
and do the same last row so it's one
step

712
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480

 

713
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,630

one step down

714
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640

 

715
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,510

again don't let the momentum expose your

716
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
again don't let the momentum expose your
 

717
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,390
again don't let the momentum expose your
block

718
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
block
 

719
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,590
block
that's a no-no you're losing connection

720
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
that's a no-no you're losing connection
 

721
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,950
that's a no-no you're losing connection
with the noggin

722
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
with the noggin
 

723
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,070
with the noggin
okay try it both sides

724
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
okay try it both sides
 

725
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,990
okay try it both sides
okay now you're going to increase

726
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
okay now you're going to increase
 

727
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,710
okay now you're going to increase
the age the illusion of momentum and

728
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
the age the illusion of momentum and
 

729
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,350
the age the illusion of momentum and
you're going to

730
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
you're going to
 

731
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,470
you're going to
reintroduce agency okay

732
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
reintroduce agency okay
 

733
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,870
reintroduce agency okay
so they have to take the dashi has to

734
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
so they have to take the dashi has to
 

735
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,149
so they have to take the dashi has to
take at least

736
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159
take at least
 

737
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,590
take at least
three steps and then they can decide

738
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
three steps and then they can decide
 

739
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,990
three steps and then they can decide
where they're going to go down which

740
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
where they're going to go down which
 

741
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,950
where they're going to go down which
foot

742
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
foot
 

743
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,470
foot
okay when they walk they walk straight

744
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
okay when they walk they walk straight
 

745
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,270
okay when they walk they walk straight
back

746
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280

 

747
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,590

not in an artificial way

748
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600

 

749
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,149

just straight back and when they decide

750
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
just straight back and when they decide
 

751
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,029
just straight back and when they decide
to take the fall that's when that foot

752
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
to take the fall that's when that foot
 

753
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,350
to take the fall that's when that foot
goes into the last drill

754
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
goes into the last drill
 

755
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,549
goes into the last drill
okay so you're walking

756
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
okay so you're walking
 

757
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,549
okay so you're walking
i decide down

758
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
i decide down
 

759
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:56,470
i decide down
walking down foot out

760
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480

 

761
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,149

when they feel comfortable you can have

762
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
when they feel comfortable you can have
 

763
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:12,070
when they feel comfortable you can have
them pick it up

764
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080

 

765
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,190

okay try both of those at your face most

766
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
okay try both of those at your face most
 

767
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,230
okay try both of those at your face most
of us find

768
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
of us find
 

769
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,029
of us find
uh a lot of comfort in our

770
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
uh a lot of comfort in our
 

771
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,070
uh a lot of comfort in our
controlling of the situation so we

controlling of the situation so we
 

773
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,950
controlling of the situation so we
that but that is not in kim the comfort

or because of
so uh what he's gonna do now

784
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
so uh what he's gonna do now
 

785
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,150
so uh what he's gonna do now
is push me with some energy

786
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,160
is push me with some energy
 

787
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,190
is push me with some energy

you remember these days okay so he's

790
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
you remember these days okay so he's
 

791
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,390
you remember these days okay so he's
gonna push me i'm gonna absorb that

792
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
gonna push me i'm gonna absorb that
 

793
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,510
gonna push me i'm gonna absorb that
energy

794
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
energy
 

795
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,750
energy
in the number of steps that i end up

796
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
in the number of steps that i end up
 

797
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,830
in the number of steps that i end up
taking and i when i go to the fall

798
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
taking and i when i go to the fall
 

799
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,230
taking and i when i go to the fall
i turn the foot out and i do that other

800
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
i turn the foot out and i do that other
 

801
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,029
i turn the foot out and i do that other
drill

802
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
drill
 

803
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,750
drill
so he's pushing

804
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760

 

805
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,830

don't let the extra momentum turn you

806
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:10,840
don't let the extra momentum turn you
 

807
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,510
don't let the extra momentum turn you
around

808
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
around
 

809
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,110
around
at this point we can teach how to get up

810
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
at this point we can teach how to get up
 

811
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,549
at this point we can teach how to get up
we use a triangle get up so

812
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
we use a triangle get up so
 

813
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,830
we use a triangle get up so
a little slower he's pushing i'm going

814
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
a little slower he's pushing i'm going
 

815
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,630
a little slower he's pushing i'm going
down

816
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
down
 

817
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,630
down
and it's just a standard jiu-jitsu

818
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
and it's just a standard jiu-jitsu
 

819
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,990
and it's just a standard jiu-jitsu
triangle get up

820
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
triangle get up
 

821
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,270
triangle get up
come up with your body post the hand

822
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
come up with your body post the hand
 

823
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,630
come up with your body post the hand
cross bottom hand and foot step out

824
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
cross bottom hand and foot step out
 

825
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,029
cross bottom hand and foot step out
up the end slope

826
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
up the end slope
 

827
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,669
up the end slope
don't use the energy okay give you a

828
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
don't use the energy okay give you a
 

829
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,470
don't use the energy okay give you a
block

830
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
block
 

831
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,830
block
and come around that's a no-no

832
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840

 

833
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,630

push

834
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
push
 

835
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,549
push
okay let's try comparison

836
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559

 

837
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,149

okay since i lose my agency to a degree

838
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
okay since i lose my agency to a degree
 

839
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,310
okay since i lose my agency to a degree
and the guy has control this is really

840
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
and the guy has control this is really
 

841
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,470
and the guy has control this is really
where you start to see the

842
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:05,480
where you start to see the
 

843
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,789
where you start to see the
disorganization

844
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
disorganization
 

845
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,549
disorganization
come in because the fear sets in the

846
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
come in because the fear sets in the
 

847
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,149
come in because the fear sets in the
darkness sets in and it

848
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
darkness sets in and it
 

849
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,950
darkness sets in and it
it's chaos it disorganizes things so i

850
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
it's chaos it disorganizes things so i
 

851
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,270
it's chaos it disorganizes things so i
started to have my center

852
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
started to have my center
 

853
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,990
started to have my center
moving with all my extremities moving

854
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
moving with all my extremities moving
 

855
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,630
moving with all my extremities moving
okay

856
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640

 

857
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,270

so uh the other thing that we've done up

858
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
so uh the other thing that we've done up
 

859
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,710
so uh the other thing that we've done up
till now is we used a

860
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
till now is we used a
 

861
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,390
till now is we used a
static hold to generate strength and

862
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
static hold to generate strength and
 

863
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,510
static hold to generate strength and
coordination

864
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
coordination
 

865
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,110
coordination
but that's not really marginally

866
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
but that's not really marginally
 

867
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,350
but that's not really marginally
functional the first drill

868
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
functional the first drill
 

869
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,470
functional the first drill
where you have a percussive flexion that

870
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
where you have a percussive flexion that
 

871
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,630
where you have a percussive flexion that
is what we're after so we have to get

872
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
is what we're after so we have to get
 

873
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,669
is what we're after so we have to get
back now

874
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
back now
 

875
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,909
back now
to that if you look that kind of

876
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
to that if you look that kind of
 

877
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,029
to that if you look that kind of
happened here

878
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
happened here
 

879
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,230
happened here
because people are like loose and then

880
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
because people are like loose and then
 

881
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,669
because people are like loose and then
you have to find your center

882
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
you have to find your center
 

883
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,630
you have to find your center
so without them knowing it they're

884
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
so without them knowing it they're
 

885
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,789
so without them knowing it they're
already getting a kind of percussion

886
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
already getting a kind of percussion
 

887
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,310
already getting a kind of percussion
but oftentimes their solution is instead

888
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
but oftentimes their solution is instead
 

889
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,430
but oftentimes their solution is instead
to do it with a disconnect you see

890
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
to do it with a disconnect you see
 

891
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,549
to do it with a disconnect you see
instead of with the

892
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
instead of with the
 

893
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,710
instead of with the
foot head coordination and that does not

894
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
foot head coordination and that does not
 

895
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,669
foot head coordination and that does not
work because

896
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
work because
 

897
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,070
work because
when he disconnects his head is coming

898
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
when he disconnects his head is coming
 

899
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,710
when he disconnects his head is coming
forward

900
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
forward
 

901
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,870
forward
and if i was throwing him backwards his

902
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
and if i was throwing him backwards his
 

903
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,909
and if i was throwing him backwards his
head is going

904
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
head is going
 

905
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,549
head is going
backwards so if he came forward i would

906
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
backwards so if he came forward i would
 

907
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,669
backwards so if he came forward i would
be adding

908
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
be adding
 

909
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,149
be adding
force at impact to let's say a palm heel

910
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
force at impact to let's say a palm heel
 

911
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,269
force at impact to let's say a palm heel
strike or something

912
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
strike or something
 

913
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,269
strike or something
okay so his head has to keep going

914
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
okay so his head has to keep going
 

915
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,870
okay so his head has to keep going
backwards my head

916
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
backwards my head
 

917
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,990
backwards my head
goes always this way

918
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000

 

919
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,350

i can't have my head go here with that

920
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
i can't have my head go here with that
 

921
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,230
i can't have my head go here with that
percussion

922
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
percussion
 

923
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,430
percussion
with that flexion my head is going

924
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
with that flexion my head is going
 

925
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,430
with that flexion my head is going
back up

926
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440

 

927
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,669

so on this drill we're going to go

928
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
so on this drill we're going to go
 

929
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,230
so on this drill we're going to go
and hit that percussion from the

930
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
and hit that percussion from the
 

931
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,230
and hit that percussion from the
opposite extreme

932
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
opposite extreme
 

933
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,230
opposite extreme
because we don't want it we don't want

934
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
because we don't want it we don't want
 

935
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,230
because we don't want it we don't want
the head coming forward

936
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
the head coming forward
 

937
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,870
the head coming forward
so he's going to hold my hakama

938
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
so he's going to hold my hakama
 

939
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,549
so he's going to hold my hakama
and get me to extend my center the other

940
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
and get me to extend my center the other
 

941
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,070
and get me to extend my center the other
way

942
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
way
 

943
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,830
way
the identity can decide what they're

944
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
the identity can decide what they're
 

945
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,750
the identity can decide what they're
comfortable with

946
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760

 

947
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,870

but the goal is to let it go let it go

948
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
but the goal is to let it go let it go
 

949
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,310
but the goal is to let it go let it go
as far as possible

950
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
as far as possible

decides
 

961
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,149
decides
when he's going to let go that's when i

962
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
when he's going to let go that's when i
 

963
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:26,789
when he's going to let go that's when i
percuss

964
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
percuss
 

965
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,830
percuss
the center like the first drill okay

966
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
the center like the first drill okay
 

967
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,669

with the triangle get up
so here i'm not

974
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
so here i'm not
 

975
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,710
so here i'm not
so vertical like in all the other drills

983
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,710

okay let's try it a little bit more

984
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,720
okay let's try it a little bit more
 

985
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:19,029
okay let's try it a little bit more
flexion a little earlier

986
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039

 

987
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,510

more double it
