00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,190

alignment and structure as it relates to

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,200
alignment and structure as it relates to
 

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,150
alignment and structure as it relates to
iida so alignment structure is simply

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,160
iida so alignment structure is simply
 

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,870
iida so alignment structure is simply
those two things alignment is my ability

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
those two things alignment is my ability
 

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,029
those two things alignment is my ability
to align my body correctly with the

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
to align my body correctly with the
 

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,990
to align my body correctly with the
ground in order to receive Force so if

12
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,000
ground in order to receive Force so if
 

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,390
ground in order to receive Force so if
mik were to grab me roughly marote and

14
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:25,400
mik were to grab me roughly marote and
 

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,870
mik were to grab me roughly marote and
push into me I can align from my foot

16
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
push into me I can align from my foot
 

17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,790
push into me I can align from my foot
through my hip through my spine into my

18
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
through my hip through my spine into my
 

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,350
through my hip through my spine into my
shoulder out my hand and into Mike so

20
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
shoulder out my hand and into Mike so
 

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,990
shoulder out my hand and into Mike so
Mike's pushing really hard this is not a

22
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,000
Mike's pushing really hard this is not a
 

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,950
Mike's pushing really hard this is not a
drink if you if I move my hand you can

24
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
drink if you if I move my hand you can
 

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,229
drink if you if I move my hand you can
see Mike's actually pushing very hard

26
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:39,239
see Mike's actually pushing very hard
 

27
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,790
see Mike's actually pushing very hard
but what I'm doing is aligning myself so

28
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:41,800
but what I'm doing is aligning myself so
 

29
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,029
but what I'm doing is aligning myself so
mik's essentially pushing through my

30
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:43,039
mik's essentially pushing through my
 

31
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,229
mik's essentially pushing through my
bones into the ground it' be no

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
bones into the ground it' be no
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,470
bones into the ground it' be no
different if you stuck a stick in the

34
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:45,480
different if you stuck a stick in the
 

35
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,790
different if you stuck a stick in the
ground and push into the ground okay so

36
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:47,800
ground and push into the ground okay so
 

37
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,590
ground and push into the ground okay so
that's a nice example of alignment this

38
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
that's a nice example of alignment this
 

39
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,470
that's a nice example of alignment this
can be done on a slightly more advanced

40
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,480
can be done on a slightly more advanced
 

41
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,950
can be done on a slightly more advanced
level if I were to sit on the ground and

42
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
level if I were to sit on the ground and
 

43
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,709
level if I were to sit on the ground and
M could to push on my head I simply

44
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
M could to push on my head I simply
 

45
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,590
M could to push on my head I simply
align from my head through my neck

46
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:56,600
align from my head through my neck
 

47
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,549
align from my head through my neck
through my spine my butt into the ground

48
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
through my spine my butt into the ground
 

49
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,670
through my spine my butt into the ground
so M essentially just pushing into the

50
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,680
so M essentially just pushing into the
 

51
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,349
so M essentially just pushing into the
ground right here Mike's trying very

52
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:02,359
ground right here Mike's trying very
 

53
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,469
ground right here Mike's trying very
hard as you can see to push me over but

54
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:05,479
hard as you can see to push me over but
 

55
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,109
hard as you can see to push me over but
he can't because I'm aligned right it's

56
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
he can't because I'm aligned right it's
 

57
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,070
he can't because I'm aligned right it's
just simply the structure of my body

58
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,080
just simply the structure of my body
 

59
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,030
just simply the structure of my body
aligning into mik uh so that could be

60
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,040
aligning into mik uh so that could be
 

61
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,270
aligning into mik uh so that could be
done with a stick or anything it's just

62
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
done with a stick or anything it's just
 

63
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,070
done with a stick or anything it's just
I'm aligning my body properly now

64
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm aligning my body properly now
 

65
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,190
I'm aligning my body properly now
there's another trick I can use in

66
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
there's another trick I can use in
 

67
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,950
there's another trick I can use in
structure if M were to push on my

68
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
structure if M were to push on my
 

69
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,789
structure if M were to push on my
shoulders and I were to Simply Touch

70
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
shoulders and I were to Simply Touch
 

71
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,749
shoulders and I were to Simply Touch
under his shoulders as he pushes he push

72
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:22,759
under his shoulders as he pushes he push
 

73
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,630
under his shoulders as he pushes he push
as hard as he wants but because my hands

74
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
as hard as he wants but because my hands
 

75
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,870
as hard as he wants but because my hands
are touching here what's happening is

76
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
are touching here what's happening is
 

77
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,270
are touching here what's happening is
and you see M's pushing very hard uh

78
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
and you see M's pushing very hard uh
 

79
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,950
and you see M's pushing very hard uh
what's happening is Mike's pushing into

80
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
what's happening is Mike's pushing into
 

81
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,030
what's happening is Mike's pushing into
himself my energy is being redirected

82
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
himself my energy is being redirected
 

83
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,670
himself my energy is being redirected
into his hands so our structure becomes

84
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:34,680
into his hands so our structure becomes
 

85
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,830
into his hands so our structure becomes
one so when he pushes he's pushing into

86
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:36,840
one so when he pushes he's pushing into
 

87
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,429
one so when he pushes he's pushing into
his own structure by trying to push me

88
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:38,439
his own structure by trying to push me
 

89
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,350
his own structure by trying to push me
over I can also do this on one foot if

90
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
over I can also do this on one foot if
 

91
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,389
over I can also do this on one foot if
Mike were to come and and here I stand

92
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:43,399
Mike were to come and and here I stand
 

93
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,270
Mike were to come and and here I stand
on one foot mik goes to push me over I'm

94
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
on one foot mik goes to push me over I'm
 

95
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,350
on one foot mik goes to push me over I'm
simply standing under see oh M can't

96
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
simply standing under see oh M can't
 

97
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,270
simply standing under see oh M can't
push me over because I have my hand

98
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
push me over because I have my hand
 

99
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,749
push me over because I have my hand
right under his arm like this as he's

100
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759
right under his arm like this as he's
 

101
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,469
right under his arm like this as he's
pushing he can't get me over I'm on one

102
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:53,479
pushing he can't get me over I'm on one
 

103
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,830
pushing he can't get me over I'm on one
foot okay so I'm using structure in that

104
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
foot okay so I'm using structure in that
 

105
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,029
foot okay so I'm using structure in that
situation to keep his force from

106
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:58,039
situation to keep his force from
 

107
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,469
situation to keep his force from
toppling me over I'm becoming one

108
00:01:59,469 --> 00:01:59,479
toppling me over I'm becoming one
 

109
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,630
toppling me over I'm becoming one
structure with him or I can simply align

110
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
structure with him or I can simply align
 

111
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,029
structure with him or I can simply align
myself from aligning through the ground

112
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:04,039
myself from aligning through the ground
 

113
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,069
myself from aligning through the ground
through my body and into my partner

114
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
through my body and into my partner
 

115
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,799
through my body and into my partner
alignment and structure
