uh asking people's different opinions

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
uh asking people's different opinions
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,390
uh asking people's different opinions
about kotagi and um one of the problems

10
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
about kotagi and um one of the problems
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,189
about kotagi and um one of the problems
that arises with kotagi which is uh when

12
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
that arises with kotagi which is uh when
 

13
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,990
that arises with kotagi which is uh when
I'm applying the technique is it

14
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm applying the technique is it
 

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,349
I'm applying the technique is it
possible for UK to come around and smash

16
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
possible for UK to come around and smash
 

17
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,950
possible for UK to come around and smash
me in the jaw um so first let's just go

18
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:23,960
me in the jaw um so first let's just go
 

19
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,950
me in the jaw um so first let's just go
ahead and look at the technique I'm

20
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
ahead and look at the technique I'm
 

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,630
ahead and look at the technique I'm
going to show from shui I think it's a

22
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
going to show from shui I think it's a
 

23
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
going to show from shui I think it's a
nice position to start

24
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
nice position to start
 

25
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,630
nice position to start
from

26
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,640

 

27
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,910

okay so that's the basic technique of

28
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
okay so that's the basic technique of
 

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,830
okay so that's the basic technique of
shui uh in that we came we started from

30
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:40,840
shui uh in that we came we started from
 

31
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,790
shui uh in that we came we started from
this position I go to the outside which

32
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
this position I go to the outside which
 

33
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,190
this position I go to the outside which
is a nice safe movement I come as Mike

34
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
is a nice safe movement I come as Mike
 

35
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,670
is a nice safe movement I come as Mike
starts to come around I'm going to apply

36
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:46,680
starts to come around I'm going to apply
 

37
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,470
starts to come around I'm going to apply
public I to him now here's where we

38
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
public I to him now here's where we
 

39
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,510
public I to him now here's where we
start to see the problem Mike can

40
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,520
start to see the problem Mike can
 

41
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,869
start to see the problem Mike can
possibly strike me here uh and the first

42
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
possibly strike me here uh and the first
 

43
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,189
possibly strike me here uh and the first
question um that Sensei asked was

44
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:56,199
question um that Sensei asked was
 

45
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,750
question um that Sensei asked was
um could uh should we allow luk to do

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
um could uh should we allow luk to do
 

47
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,950
um could uh should we allow luk to do
this in my opinion we should for the

48
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:01,960
this in my opinion we should for the
 

49
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,070
this in my opinion we should for the
practice of iido because this is a safe

50
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
practice of iido because this is a safe
 

51
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,469
practice of iido because this is a safe
position for him to take the fall from

52
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:05,479
position for him to take the fall from
 

53
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,230
position for him to take the fall from
you can see here Mike nicely sets up for

54
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,240
you can see here Mike nicely sets up for
 

55
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,990
you can see here Mike nicely sets up for
a high fall he's in good position he's

56
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
a high fall he's in good position he's
 

57
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,749
a high fall he's in good position he's
safe and everything set up really nice

58
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:10,759
safe and everything set up really nice
 

59
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,630
safe and everything set up really nice
for him so I think that's the easiest

60
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
for him so I think that's the easiest
 

61
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,550
for him so I think that's the easiest
thing for Mike to do also one of the big

62
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
thing for Mike to do also one of the big
 

63
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,749
thing for Mike to do also one of the big
misnomers about kot is kage makes people

64
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:16,759
misnomers about kot is kage makes people
 

65
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,870
misnomers about kot is kage makes people
take a high fall that's incorrect kage

66
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
take a high fall that's incorrect kage
 

67
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,789
take a high fall that's incorrect kage
puts a lot of torque on this wrist and

68
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
puts a lot of torque on this wrist and
 

69
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,749
puts a lot of torque on this wrist and
if Mike doesn't take a high fall or

70
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:22,759
if Mike doesn't take a high fall or
 

71
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,109
if Mike doesn't take a high fall or
otherwise relieve the pressure in his

72
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
otherwise relieve the pressure in his
 

73
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,390
otherwise relieve the pressure in his
wrist it's going to damage his wrist so

74
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,400
wrist it's going to damage his wrist so
 

75
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,190
wrist it's going to damage his wrist so
Mike chooses to take the high ball and

76
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
Mike chooses to take the high ball and
 

77
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,390
Mike chooses to take the high ball and
because I'm a good N I want to let him

78
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:29,400
because I'm a good N I want to let him
 

79
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,590
because I'm a good N I want to let him
take that high so it's safe for him okay

80
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,600
take that high so it's safe for him okay
 

81
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,550
take that high so it's safe for him okay
can C gu should be applied in ways that

82
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
can C gu should be applied in ways that
 

83
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,789
can C gu should be applied in ways that
keeps that from happening if the timing

84
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
keeps that from happening if the timing
 

85
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,950
keeps that from happening if the timing
of my technique is such that I can come

86
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
of my technique is such that I can come
 

87
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,270
of my technique is such that I can come
right back here I can possibly apply

88
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
right back here I can possibly apply
 

89
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,710
right back here I can possibly apply
that technique so Mike cannot come

90
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:43,720
that technique so Mike cannot come
 

91
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,030
that technique so Mike cannot come
around to strike me um and this is find

92
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,040
around to strike me um and this is find
 

93
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,310
around to strike me um and this is find
in a form and we could always practice

94
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,320
in a form and we could always practice
 

95
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,830
in a form and we could always practice
it in the form this way but when we're

96
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
it in the form this way but when we're
 

97
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,670
it in the form this way but when we're
doing it in a live situation where I

98
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
doing it in a live situation where I
 

99
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,109
doing it in a live situation where I
don't know what Mike's up to and he

100
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:52,119
don't know what Mike's up to and he
 

101
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,429
don't know what Mike's up to and he
might be attacking me in all kinds of

102
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
might be attacking me in all kinds of
 

103
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,030
might be attacking me in all kinds of
different ways there's no guarantee that

104
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
different ways there's no guarantee that
 

105
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,789
different ways there's no guarantee that
that's going to happen and so it's quite

106
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
that's going to happen and so it's quite
 

107
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,590
that's going to happen and so it's quite
a real possibility that when I apply

108
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:58,600
a real possibility that when I apply
 

109
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,190
a real possibility that when I apply
this code of gu no matter how will I

110
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,200
this code of gu no matter how will I
 

111
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,990
this code of gu no matter how will I
like it might can still come around and

112
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
like it might can still come around and
 

113
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,709
like it might can still come around and
smash me in the face or grab me or do

114
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:03,719
smash me in the face or grab me or do
 

115
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,469
smash me in the face or grab me or do
something badly um so now we need to

116
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
something badly um so now we need to
 

117
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,229
something badly um so now we need to
really ask a bigger question I think

118
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
really ask a bigger question I think
 

119
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,350
really ask a bigger question I think
which is why would I apply K in the

120
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,360
which is why would I apply K in the
 

121
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,229
which is why would I apply K in the
first place uh am I applying KAG to

122
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:13,239
first place uh am I applying KAG to
 

123
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,150
first place uh am I applying KAG to
throw M if the answer is that if I want

124
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
throw M if the answer is that if I want
 

125
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,869
throw M if the answer is that if I want
to just throw Mike that's the big deal

126
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
to just throw Mike that's the big deal
 

127
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,110
to just throw Mike that's the big deal
and so he gets this kage position as

128
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,120
and so he gets this kage position as
 

129
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,190
and so he gets this kage position as
Mike comes around a better option for me

130
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
Mike comes around a better option for me
 

131
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,949
Mike comes around a better option for me
is to throw Mike over my hip it's going

132
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
is to throw Mike over my hip it's going
 

133
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,110
is to throw Mike over my hip it's going
to be a higher percentage throw for me

134
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
to be a higher percentage throw for me
 

135
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,589
to be a higher percentage throw for me
it's going to throw Mike in a nicer way

136
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:28,599
it's going to throw Mike in a nicer way
 

137
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,550
it's going to throw Mike in a nicer way
it's going to put us in a control

138
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,560
it's going to put us in a control
 

139
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,550
it's going to put us in a control
position really quickly I would rather

140
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
position really quickly I would rather
 

141
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,550
position really quickly I would rather
do that so as M comes around and punch

142
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:33,560
do that so as M comes around and punch
 

143
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,190
do that so as M comes around and punch
me in the face why not just get out of

144
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
me in the face why not just get out of
 

145
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,710
me in the face why not just get out of
the way of that I can set up a nice hip

146
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
the way of that I can set up a nice hip
 

147
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,509
the way of that I can set up a nice hip
toss here and that would be a much

148
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:38,519
toss here and that would be a much
 

149
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:39,790
toss here and that would be a much
better idea than trying to apply the

150
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:39,800
better idea than trying to apply the
 

151
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,190
better idea than trying to apply the
CTIC iish um could the the question be

152
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
CTIC iish um could the the question be
 

153
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,869
CTIC iish um could the the question be
uh or the answer be that I'm applying

154
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
uh or the answer be that I'm applying
 

155
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,630
uh or the answer be that I'm applying
CTIC I to create a lot of pain in Mike's

156
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
CTIC I to create a lot of pain in Mike's
 

157
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,390
CTIC I to create a lot of pain in Mike's
wrist right so I make him think twice

158
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
wrist right so I make him think twice
 

159
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,550
wrist right so I make him think twice
about wanting to fight me because I

as he comes around even if he hits me
 

215
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,550
as he comes around even if he hits me
what I'm going to manage to do is get

216
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:47,560
what I'm going to manage to do is get
 

217
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,309
what I'm going to manage to do is get
the knife from M and when I get the

218
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:49,319
the knife from M and when I get the
 

219
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,630
the knife from M and when I get the

221
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,309
knife then I don't even care if it hit
me cuz I'm now in the superior position

222
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
me cuz I'm now in the superior position
 

223
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,470
me cuz I'm now in the superior position
with the weapon so the weapon's taking

224
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
with the weapon so the weapon's taking
 

225
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,110
with the weapon so the weapon's taking
precedent and this is an old idea of

226
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,120
precedent and this is an old idea of
 

227
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,429
precedent and this is an old idea of
kuchi where if he strikes me I want to

228
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:58,439
kuchi where if he strikes me I want to
 

229
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,190
kuchi where if he strikes me I want to
be able to cut him right

be able to cut him right
 

231
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,710
be able to cut him right
and US said that this wasn't the idea

232
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
and US said that this wasn't the idea
 

233
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,589
and US said that this wasn't the idea
BYO so we can talk about more stuff from

234
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:04,599
BYO so we can talk about more stuff from
 

235
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,350
BYO so we can talk about more stuff from
that also so let's say that as we do

236
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,360
that also so let's say that as we do
 

237
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,350
that also so let's say that as we do
this might comes around to strike me are

238
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,360
this might comes around to strike me are
 

239

00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:12,599
there other ways to deal with this as
 

241
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,190
there other ways to deal with this as
might comes into strike I can use my

242
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,200
might comes into strike I can use my
 

243
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,270

247
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,710
Mike with this as it comes in if I get
the pass I can also go into other IO

248
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
the pass I can also go into other IO
 

249
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,069
the pass I can also go into other IO
techniques from here like juj net so

250
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
techniques from here like juj net so
 

251
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,390

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,710
comes in there's lots of ways to take
care of that hand and still apply the C

258
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:29,720
care of that hand and still apply the C
 

259
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,990

G also as I take this in I can apply put

260
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,000
G also as I take this in I can apply put
 

261
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,710
G also as I take this in I can apply put
the Gish in a way that breaks the blade

262
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
the Gish in a way that breaks the blade
 

263
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,629
the Gish in a way that breaks the blade
towards M which makes him get out of the

00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
towards M which makes him get out of the
 

265
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,510
towards M which makes him get out of the
way even if I don't disarm now we're in

266
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
way even if I don't disarm now we're in
 

267

over start to
control and remove the weapon so I think

272
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:46,600
control and remove the weapon so I think
 

273

outside of pure unarmed methods uh if
 

281
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,029
outside of pure unarmed methods uh if
we're unarmed I would way rather use uh
