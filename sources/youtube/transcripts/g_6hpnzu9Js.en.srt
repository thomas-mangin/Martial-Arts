of some key philosophers is that that's

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:57,650
of some key philosophers is that that's
 

51
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,080
of some key philosophers is that that's
actually the when power is lost there's

52
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,090
actually the when power is lost there's
 

53
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,670
actually the when power is lost there's
a whole other set of power that never

54
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:06,680
a whole other set of power that never
 

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,900
a whole other set of power that never
has to use an armored vehicle and that

56
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:10,910
has to use an armored vehicle and that
 

57
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,970
has to use an armored vehicle and that
power is much more dominating

58
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:13,980
power is much more dominating
 

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,839
power is much more dominating
and so in comparison the armored vehicle

60
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:17,849
and so in comparison the armored vehicle
 

61
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,670
and so in comparison the armored vehicle
to this other kind of power that I'm

62
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
to this other kind of power that I'm
 

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,839
to this other kind of power that I'm
talking about is is actually the losing

64
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:23,849
talking about is is actually the losing
 

65
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,570
talking about is is actually the losing
of power so we all remember when when

66
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:29,580
of power so we all remember when when
 

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,690
of power so we all remember when when

listening to what I'm saying you're
thinking that when I push on the skies

124
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:21,239
thinking that when I push on the skies
 

125
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,680
thinking that when I push on the skies
because I'm losing power

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:23,690
because I'm losing power
 

127
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,600
because I'm losing power
true but so is the other door

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,610
true but so is the other door
 

129
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,020
true but so is the other door
action it's when I push on them that's

130
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,030
action it's when I push on them that's
 

131
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,450
action it's when I push on them that's
making me lose power it's not just I'm

132
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,460
making me lose power it's not just I'm
 

133
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,550
making me lose power it's not just I'm
losing power therefore I push on them

134
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:35,560
losing power therefore I push on them
 

135
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,790
losing power therefore I push on them
and I think that's what happens to your

136
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
and I think that's what happens to your
 

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,330
and I think that's what happens to your
technique in particular is when you let

138
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,340
technique in particular is when you let
 

139
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,969
technique in particular is when you let
them capture your mind like your grip

140
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:44,979
them capture your mind like your grip
 

141
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,969
them capture your mind like your grip
you feel their you feel the squeeze of

142
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:47,979
you feel their you feel the squeeze of
 

143
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:51,050
you feel their you feel the squeeze of
their two hands on your wrist and you

144
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,060
their two hands on your wrist and you
 

145
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,320
their two hands on your wrist and you
want to pull on it and when you pull on

146
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,330
want to pull on it and when you pull on
 

147
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,010
want to pull on it and when you pull on
it well you've now made their grip

148
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,020
it well you've now made their grip
 

149
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,689
it well you've now made their grip
stronger versus turn your hand in that

150
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:03,699
stronger versus turn your hand in that
 

151
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,189
stronger versus turn your hand in that
kind of koku inward turning spiral right

152
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:08,199
kind of koku inward turning spiral right
 

153
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,149
kind of koku inward turning spiral right
and then their grip gets weaker as you

154
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:12,159
and then their grip gets weaker as you
 

155
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:16,800
and then their grip gets weaker as you
ignore it might we even say it got

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:16,810
ignore it might we even say it got
 

157
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,809
ignore it might we even say it got
weaker because you did ignore it I would

158
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:21,819
weaker because you did ignore it I would
 

159
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,589
weaker because you did ignore it I would
say that's true as well so when I did

160
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:25,599
say that's true as well so when I did
 

161
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:29,969
say that's true as well so when I did
when I'm doing the techniques I play a

162
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:29,979
when I'm doing the techniques I play a
 

163
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,329
when I'm doing the techniques I play a
game like I'm sure not holding on to me

164
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:33,339
game like I'm sure not holding on to me
 

165

so as you guys are moving from you know

572
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:15,820
so as you guys are moving from you know
 

573
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,699
so as you guys are moving from you know
intermediate to advanced and you're

more sophisticated stuff you probably

578
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:24,409
more sophisticated stuff you probably
 

579
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,019
more sophisticated stuff you probably
don't know cuz it always feels the same

580
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:26,029
don't know cuz it always feels the same
 

581
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,669
don't know cuz it always feels the same
right it's always hard it's always

back some older videos but I would ask
you to keep in mind as we're doing this

588
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:44,199
you to keep in mind as we're doing this
 

589
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,949
you to keep in mind as we're doing this
that as wrong as what looking back now

590

appears to you now this one's probably
 

595
00:18:53,629 --> 00:19:00,129
appears to you now this one's probably
also going to be wrong but you can find

596
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:00,139
also going to be wrong but you can find
 

597
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,369
also going to be wrong but you can find
it I think if you just look deep enough
