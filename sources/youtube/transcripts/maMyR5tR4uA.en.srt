171
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,789
where you brought your arm off
right and i followed there's two

172
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
right and i followed there's two
 

173
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,470
right and i followed there's two
different ways that our hands stay

174
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
different ways that our hands stay
 

175
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,070
different ways that our hands stay
connected

176
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
connected
 

177
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,470
connected
you don't have the adhesion one okay do

178
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
you don't have the adhesion one okay do
 

179
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,670
you don't have the adhesion one okay do
you guys see that

180
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
you guys see that
 

181
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,509
you guys see that
okay which is why i'm able to stay

182
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
okay which is why i'm able to stay
 

183
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,789
okay which is why i'm able to stay
perfectly upright so i try to touch you

184
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
perfectly upright so i try to touch you
 

185
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,710
perfectly upright so i try to touch you
and you can maybe stick to me but

186
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
and you can maybe stick to me but
 

187
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,110
and you can maybe stick to me but
you don't affect my balance do you get

188
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
you don't affect my balance do you get
 

189
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,830
you don't affect my balance do you get
it okay

190
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
it okay
 

191
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,990
it okay
so as you're going to do the drill

192
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000

 

193
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,990

and i want you to feel the different

194
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
and i want you to feel the different
 

195
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,070
and i want you to feel the different
ways that i'm staying stuck to you

196
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080

 

197
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,550

see if you can verbalize when when it's

198
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
see if you can verbalize when when it's
 

199
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,510
see if you can verbalize when when it's
a following

200
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
a following
 

201
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,310
a following
and when it's at adhering i'm hearing

202
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
and when it's at adhering i'm hearing
 

203
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,710
and when it's at adhering i'm hearing
okay

204
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
okay
 

205
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,790
okay
good following good and something else

206
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
good following good and something else
 

207
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,670
good following good and something else
is happening

208
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
is happening
 

209
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,950
is happening
if you pay attention uh let's say for

210
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
if you pay attention uh let's say for
 

211
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,390
if you pay attention uh let's say for
example

212
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
example
 

213
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,749
example
you disconnect right now disconnect

214
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
you disconnect right now disconnect
 

215
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,189
you disconnect right now disconnect
did you still fall yeah okay yes

216
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
did you still fall yeah okay yes
 

217
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,870
did you still fall yeah okay yes
just connect do you see

218
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880

 

219
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,150

disconnect do you see do you see that

220
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
disconnect do you see do you see that
 

221
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,350
disconnect do you see do you see that
okay so that felt very weird to you

222
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
okay so that felt very weird to you
 

223
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,029
okay so that felt very weird to you
right to disconnect because you knew you

224
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
right to disconnect because you knew you
 

225
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,990
right to disconnect because you knew you
were gonna fall

226
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
were gonna fall
 

227
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,270
were gonna fall
right um so let's look at

228
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
right um so let's look at
 

229
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,350
right um so let's look at
let's let's slow down that motion where

230
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
let's let's slow down that motion where
 

231
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,350
let's let's slow down that motion where
you're teetering do you see

232
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
you're teetering do you see
 

233
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,510
you're teetering do you see
uh did you feel your pressure increase

234
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
uh did you feel your pressure increase
 

235
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,430
uh did you feel your pressure increase
here okay

236
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
here okay
 

237
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,629
here okay
uh decrease that pressure

238
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
uh decrease that pressure
 

239
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,909
uh decrease that pressure
do you see what's happening to you

240
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
do you see what's happening to you
 

241
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,150
do you see what's happening to you
what's happening to you

242
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
what's happening to you
 

243
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,909
what's happening to you
what's happening to your balance you're

244
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
what's happening to your balance you're
 

245
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,830
what's happening to your balance you're
falling okay

246
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
falling okay
 

247
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,029
falling okay
so why did you increase pressure on the

248
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
so why did you increase pressure on the
 

249
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,990
so why did you increase pressure on the
arm

250
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
arm
 

251
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,510
arm
to keep your balance do you see that so

252
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
to keep your balance do you see that so
 

253
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,950
to keep your balance do you see that so
as i go i there's an adhesion right here

254
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
as i go i there's an adhesion right here
 

255
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,309
as i go i there's an adhesion right here
okay just stay there i'll show you

256
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319

 

257
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,990

but you press into the adhesion

258
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
but you press into the adhesion
 

259
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,710
but you press into the adhesion
to keep your balance right if you take

260
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
to keep your balance right if you take
 

261
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,350
to keep your balance right if you take
off that

262
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
off that
 

263
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,430
off that
so you can watch if you push really hard

264
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
so you can watch if you push really hard
 

265
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,629
so you can watch if you push really hard
into the adhesion

266
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
into the adhesion
 

267
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,670
into the adhesion
you can balance there you see that okay

268
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
you can balance there you see that okay
 

269
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,749
you can balance there you see that okay
and now as you start taking away really

270
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
and now as you start taking away really
 

271
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,110
and now as you start taking away really
you can take more into the tilt just

272
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
you can take more into the tilt just
 

273
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,230
you can take more into the tilt just
push into the extrusion

274
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
push into the extrusion
 

275
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,189
push into the extrusion
and you're using my face as your balance

276
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
and you're using my face as your balance
 

277
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,830
and you're using my face as your balance
do you see

278
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
do you see
 

279
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,990
do you see
you you're very precarious right now

280
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
you you're very precarious right now
 

281
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,469
you you're very precarious right now
right now if you take away that pressure

282
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
right now if you take away that pressure
 

283
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,510
right now if you take away that pressure
look what's going to happen take it away

284
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
look what's going to happen take it away
 

285
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,990
look what's going to happen take it away
she'll go into the following okay so

286
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
she'll go into the following okay so
 

287
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,629
she'll go into the following okay so
there's

288
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
there's
 

289
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,909
there's
three things to realize one is the

290
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
three things to realize one is the
 

291
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,189
three things to realize one is the
adhesion skill

292
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
adhesion skill
 

293
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,150
adhesion skill
which is an internal skill two is the

294
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
which is an internal skill two is the
 

295
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,590
which is an internal skill two is the
following skill

296
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
following skill
 

297
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,029
following skill
where i keep connected to her and three

298
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
where i keep connected to her and three
 

299
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,550
where i keep connected to her and three
is a psychological effect of the

300
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
is a psychological effect of the
 

301
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,350
is a psychological effect of the
adhesion

302
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
adhesion
 

303
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,790
adhesion
being used to take kazushi the person

304
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
being used to take kazushi the person
 

305
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,629
being used to take kazushi the person
will feed the adhesion

306
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
will feed the adhesion
 

307
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,670
will feed the adhesion
to maintain their balance longer you see

308
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
to maintain their balance longer you see
 

309
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:57,909
to maintain their balance longer you see
it

310
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
it
 

311
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,070
it
that's why she doesn't pull the arm in

312
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
that's why she doesn't pull the arm in
 

313
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,189
that's why she doesn't pull the arm in
at that point

314
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
at that point
 

315
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,589
at that point
if she did pull the arm in and i wanted

316
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
if she did pull the arm in and i wanted
 

317
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,670
if she did pull the arm in and i wanted
to keep connection what would i do just

318
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
to keep connection what would i do just
 

319
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,629
to keep connection what would i do just
follow it in

320
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
follow it in
 

321
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,710
follow it in
you see you followed it in the arm and

322
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
you see you followed it in the arm and
 

323
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,029
you see you followed it in the arm and
still be stuck on mine

324
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
still be stuck on mine
 

325
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,270
still be stuck on mine
what is different from those three

326
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
what is different from those three
 

327
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,469
what is different from those three
things

328
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
things
 

329
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,629
things
that is uh me as ukip

330
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
that is uh me as ukip
 

331
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,830
that is uh me as ukip
staying connected to you do you see that

332
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
staying connected to you do you see that
 

333
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,990
staying connected to you do you see that
so this is what that looks like i'll do

334
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
so this is what that looks like i'll do
 

335
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,909
so this is what that looks like i'll do
you go around

336
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919

 

337
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,390

you can't tell who's nagged do you see

338
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
you can't tell who's nagged do you see
 

339
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,029

517
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,949
because it's hard to bring it all the
way back because your momentum is going

518
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
way back because your momentum is going
 

519
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,829
way back because your momentum is going
this way

520
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
this way
 

521
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,910
this way
do you see it's hard to go reverse

522
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
do you see it's hard to go reverse
 

523
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,269
do you see it's hard to go reverse
motion

524
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279

 

525
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,310

so now face me

526
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320

 

527
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,310

and she comes in with the knife here

528
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
and she comes in with the knife here
 

529
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,430
and she comes in with the knife here
i'm moving but if i move over here

530
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
i'm moving but if i move over here
 

531
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,310
i'm moving but if i move over here
it's the same thing as i'm not where

532
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
it's the same thing as i'm not where
 

533
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,230
it's the same thing as i'm not where
that range is

534
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
that range is
 

535
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,990
that range is
do you see that so we'll do it again

536
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000

 

537
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,190

and let's pull the knife

538
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
and let's pull the knife
 

539
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,550
and let's pull the knife
in

540
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560

 

541
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,190

what are you here to see

542
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
what are you here to see
 

543
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,710
what are you here to see
okay let's slow it down so you see

544
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
okay let's slow it down so you see
 

545
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,069
okay let's slow it down so you see
so the first one is i'm not there

546
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
so the first one is i'm not there
 

547
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,829
so the first one is i'm not there
so she has to latch in

548
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839

 

549
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,310

then there's this stay still

550
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
then there's this stay still
 

551
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,550
then there's this stay still
i'm gonna have her not come forward

552
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
i'm gonna have her not come forward
 

553
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,460
i'm gonna have her not come forward
there's this

554
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,470

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,110

do you see there's that adhesion

558
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
do you see there's that adhesion
 

559
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,110
do you see there's that adhesion
so her arm is is committed to the thrust

560
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
so her arm is is committed to the thrust
 

561
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,310
so her arm is is committed to the thrust
that's why it extends it's hard to pull

562
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
that's why it extends it's hard to pull
 

563
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,710
that's why it extends it's hard to pull
back

564
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
back
 

565
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,189
back
because she's being thrown forward but

566
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
because she's being thrown forward but
 

567
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,269
because she's being thrown forward but
there's an adhesion

568
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
there's an adhesion
 

569
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,870
there's an adhesion
that keeps it long you see that

570
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880

 

571
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,790

where's the momentum come from

572
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800

 

573
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,069

on the backhand so

574
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
on the backhand so
 

575
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,509
on the backhand so
violence goes do you feel what you did

576
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
violence goes do you feel what you did
 

577
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,629
violence goes do you feel what you did
when balance goes

578
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
when balance goes
 

579
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,389
when balance goes
what did you do i tried to put pressure

580
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
what did you do i tried to put pressure
 

581
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,389
what did you do i tried to put pressure
she's putting pressure on me

582
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
she's putting pressure on me
 

583
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,710
she's putting pressure on me
because her balance is going right

584
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
because her balance is going right
 

585
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,829
because her balance is going right
so feel that indeed

586
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
so feel that indeed
 

587
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,470
so feel that indeed
not so great enough to make you take a

588
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
not so great enough to make you take a
 

589
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,509

590
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519

but when we ask them they can get

592
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
but when we ask them they can get
 

593
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,189
but when we ask them they can get
tighter

594
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
tighter
 

595
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,629
tighter
because you don't want to fall okay

596
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
because you don't want to fall okay
 

597
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,430
because you don't want to fall okay
so it's not that she's keeping it out

598
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
so it's not that she's keeping it out
 

599
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,710
so it's not that she's keeping it out
there and stuck to me and so i moved

600
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
there and stuck to me and so i moved
 

601
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,829
there and stuck to me and so i moved
kept an adhesion took her balance

602
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
kept an adhesion took her balance
 

603
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,110
kept an adhesion took her balance
she braces on me the knife is stuck

604
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
she braces on me the knife is stuck
 

605
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,269
she braces on me the knife is stuck
on me okay let's try okay so

00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
on me okay let's try okay so
 

607
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,670
on me okay let's try okay so
uh the first is coming in but she's not

608
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
uh the first is coming in but she's not
 

609
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,310
uh the first is coming in but she's not
there

610
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
there
 

611
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,790
there
you're gonna come in the knife this way

612
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
you're gonna come in the knife this way
 

613
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,990
you're gonna come in the knife this way
this way

614
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
this way
 

615
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,790
this way
do that same get us to the tip there you

616
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
do that same get us to the tip there you
 

617
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,069
do that same get us to the tip there you
go don't go backwards

618
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
go don't go backwards
 

619
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,629
go don't go backwards
come forward forward yes there it is

620
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
come forward forward yes there it is
 

621
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,509
come forward forward yes there it is
right there

622
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
right there
 

623
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,189
right there
okay so rodent resisted

624
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
okay so rodent resisted
 

625
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,150
okay so rodent resisted
the throat he resisted but he got some

626
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
the throat he resisted but he got some
 

627
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,269

bottles taken off

628
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
bottles taken off
 

629
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,310

you see

630
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320

 

631
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,150

so

632
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160

637
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:46,310

639
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,030

what happened to your arm

640
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040

 

641
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,069

so let's go back i go one

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
so let's go back i go one
 

643
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,749
so let's go back i go one

no adhesion because you left it there

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
no adhesion because you left it there
 

663
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,230
no adhesion because you left it there
you see

there's that balance you see did you

there's that balance you see did you

673
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,270

so what's causing the delay between the
