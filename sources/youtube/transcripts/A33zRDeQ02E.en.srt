hi everyone alex gin here so i'm going

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
hi everyone alex gin here so i'm going
 

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,909
hi everyone alex gin here so i'm going
to continue with this series of videos

4
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
to continue with this series of videos
 

5
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,430
to continue with this series of videos
looking at training indoors

6
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
looking at training indoors
 

7
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,110
looking at training indoors
and today i'm going to be specifically

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
and today i'm going to be specifically
 

9
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,549
and today i'm going to be specifically
focusing on the clubs

10
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
focusing on the clubs
 

11
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,550
focusing on the clubs
and what options we potentially have

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
and what options we potentially have
 

13
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,390
and what options we potentially have
in my previous two videos i talk about

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
in my previous two videos i talk about
 

15
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,230
in my previous two videos i talk about
training with sword and staff inside

16
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
training with sword and staff inside
 

17
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,510
training with sword and staff inside
and quite often the problem is the

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
and quite often the problem is the
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,670
and quite often the problem is the
ceiling height or the surrounding space

20
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
ceiling height or the surrounding space
 

21
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,509
ceiling height or the surrounding space
i talk about using the wall and how the

22
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
i talk about using the wall and how the
 

23
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,029
i talk about using the wall and how the
wall can actually help you with your

24
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
wall can actually help you with your
 

25
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,670
wall can actually help you with your
technique

26
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
technique
 

27
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,950
technique
so there's a common problem that i see

28
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
so there's a common problem that i see
 

29
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,390
so there's a common problem that i see
with club swingers and that's when

30
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
with club swingers and that's when
 

31
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,830
with club swingers and that's when
they're performing a circle behind the

32
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
they're performing a circle behind the
 

33
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,790
they're performing a circle behind the
head

34
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
head
 

35
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,549
head
when they get up into this position

36
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
when they get up into this position
 

37
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,150
when they get up into this position
rather than letting the club drop

38
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
rather than letting the club drop
 

39
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,270
rather than letting the club drop
open the chest out and extend out

40
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
open the chest out and extend out
 

41
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,470
open the chest out and extend out
what ends up happening is they open the

42
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
what ends up happening is they open the
 

43
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,910
what ends up happening is they open the
chest out but they don't let the club

44
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
chest out but they don't let the club
 

45
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,830
chest out but they don't let the club
drop they keep it on the same level

46
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
drop they keep it on the same level
 

47
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,110
drop they keep it on the same level
and if you have a look there that's

48
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
and if you have a look there that's
 

49
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,350
and if you have a look there that's
where you'd be hitting the wall side on

50
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
where you'd be hitting the wall side on
 

51
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,069
where you'd be hitting the wall side on
you'd see what happens is they do this

52
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
you'd see what happens is they do this
 

53
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,350
you'd see what happens is they do this
type of motion

54
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
type of motion
 

55
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,389
type of motion
so the club moves across rather than

56
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
so the club moves across rather than
 

57
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,150
so the club moves across rather than
dropping down and

58
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
dropping down and
 

59
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,189
dropping down and
circling behind the body and out the

60
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
circling behind the body and out the
 

61
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,229
circling behind the body and out the
actual motion

62
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
actual motion
 

63
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,590
actual motion
it should be here it comes up and behind

64
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
it should be here it comes up and behind
 

65
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,109
it should be here it comes up and behind
the body

66
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
the body
 

67
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,030
the body
and then circles out you can even do a

68
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
and then circles out you can even do a
 

69
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,870
and then circles out you can even do a
semi-circle behind your head

70
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
semi-circle behind your head
 

71
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,149
semi-circle behind your head
in this type of motion as practice so as

72
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
in this type of motion as practice so as
 

73
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,149
in this type of motion as practice so as
you can see here restricted space can

74
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
you can see here restricted space can
 

75
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,670
you can see here restricted space can
actually help with clean planes and

76
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
actually help with clean planes and
 

77
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,270
actually help with clean planes and
correct alignment

78
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
correct alignment
 

79
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,749
correct alignment
this can be practiced both with outwards

80
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
this can be practiced both with outwards
 

81
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,030
this can be practiced both with outwards
and inward swings

82
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040

 

83
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,870

so to form these swings we need space

84
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
so to form these swings we need space
 

85
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,230
so to form these swings we need space
either side

86
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
either side
 

87
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,069
either side
but what can we do in even more limited

88
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
but what can we do in even more limited
 

89
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,830
but what can we do in even more limited
space using the same idea we can

90
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
space using the same idea we can
 

91
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,510
space using the same idea we can
practice smaller circles rotating from

92
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
practice smaller circles rotating from
 

93
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,469
practice smaller circles rotating from
the wrist

94
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479

 

95
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,550

so i can also practice it on the inside

96
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
so i can also practice it on the inside
 

97
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,270
so i can also practice it on the inside
going both forwards

98
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
going both forwards
 

99
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,789
going both forwards
and backwards we could also train these

100
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
and backwards we could also train these
 

101
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,389
and backwards we could also train these
movements using two clubs

102
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
movements using two clubs
 

103
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,469
movements using two clubs
practicing variations using timing and

104
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
practicing variations using timing and
 

105
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,429
practicing variations using timing and
direction

106
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
direction
 

107
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,350
direction
the clubs could be swung in parallel

108
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
the clubs could be swung in parallel
 

109
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,710
the clubs could be swung in parallel
from the outside

110
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
from the outside
 

111
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,590
from the outside
from the inside and one inside and one

112
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
from the inside and one inside and one
 

113
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,389
from the inside and one inside and one
outside

114
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
outside
 

115
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,670
outside
so here i'm showing you the movements

116
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
so here i'm showing you the movements
 

117
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,910
so here i'm showing you the movements
going forwards but the direction can

118
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
going forwards but the direction can
 

119
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,870
going forwards but the direction can
also be reversed

120
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
also be reversed
 

121
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,830
also be reversed
going backwards using the three same

122
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
going backwards using the three same
 

123
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,949
going backwards using the three same
options

124
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
options
 

125
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,389
options
the clubs can also move in the same

126
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
the clubs can also move in the same
 

127
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,630
the clubs can also move in the same
direction using split time

128
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
direction using split time
 

129
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,229
direction using split time
this means that they'll be facing away

130
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
this means that they'll be facing away
 

131
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,750
this means that they'll be facing away
from each other as they rotate through

132
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
from each other as they rotate through
 

133
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,070
from each other as they rotate through
the circle

134
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
the circle
 

135
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,910
the circle
the clubs can also move anti-parallel

136
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
the clubs can also move anti-parallel
 

137
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,190
the clubs can also move anti-parallel
meaning they're moving in opposite

138
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
meaning they're moving in opposite
 

139
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,150
meaning they're moving in opposite
directions

140
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
directions
 

141
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,830
directions
with cross points either at the top and

142
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
with cross points either at the top and
 

143
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,990
with cross points either at the top and
bottom or left and right of the circle

144
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000

 

145
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,510

these movements can then all be put

146
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
these movements can then all be put
 

147
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,270
these movements can then all be put
together creating numerous patterns

148
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
together creating numerous patterns
 

149
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,790
together creating numerous patterns
with various possibilities

150
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
with various possibilities

video i plan to look at some similar
 

163
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,470
video i plan to look at some similar
concepts but with body movement

164
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
concepts but with body movement
 

165
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,309
concepts but with body movement
anyway until then take care and i'll see

166
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
anyway until then take care and i'll see
 

167
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,870
anyway until then take care and i'll see
you soon
