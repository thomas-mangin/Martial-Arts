## Channel Description

Christopher Hine's systematic, position-based approach to Aikido. Focuses on organizing techniques through spatial/tactical positioning rather than traditional kata memorization. Emphasizes practical constraints, realistic threat assessment (especially knife defense), and pedagogical clarity for beginning/intermediate students.

## Key Focus Areas

### Primary Themes:
1. **Positional Theory** - Four positions (muhani, hanmi, hitomi, irimi) as organizing framework
2. **Technique Categorization** - Seven orthodox nage waza as core curriculum
3. **Weapon Defense** - Knife disarms and realistic threat priorities
4. **Movement Principles** - Teno henko, irimi, avoiding backward movement
5. **Pedagogical Revision** - Simplifying traditional explanations for modern learners

### Content Style:
- **Format**: 6-12 minute technical breakdowns
- **Setting**: Small garage dojo
- **Presentation**: Conversational, direct, minimal formality
- **Demonstration**: Consistent training partners (Josh, Maya)

### Unique Value:
- Systematic positional framework rarely articulated elsewhere
- Brutally realistic about martial effectiveness and threat priorities
- Meta-commentary on *why* he's changing traditional teaching methods
- Accessible to skeptics and practical-minded martial artists
