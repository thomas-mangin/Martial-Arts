## Overview

His teaching emphasizes effectiveness over aesthetics, with a strong focus on principles that work in real violent encounters rather than "seminar content" that looks impressive but lacks practical application.

## Teaching Philosophy

- **"Drill makes skill, but you use skill not drill"** - Practice forms to develop abilities, but apply fluidly in real situations
- **Attack the attacker** - Don't focus on defending or disarming; shift from victim to aggressor
- **Continuous pressure** - Hit multiple times until threat is neutralized
- **Pain first, then technique** - Inflict pain before executing positional techniques
- **Cultural context matters** - Silat shaped by Southeast Asian water villages, mob scenarios, environmental tactics
- **Purposeful drilling** - Empty drilling without understanding and application is useless

---

## Key Concepts

1. **Role Reversal**: Change from victim to attacker in knife scenarios
2. **Continuous Attack**: "Hit hit hit hit hit" - don't rely on single techniques
3. **Pain Compliance**: Target liver, ribs, spleen to collapse opponent
4. **Environmental Tactics**: "Push off the bridge" mentality from water village context
5. **Reading and Baiting**: Deliberately elicit specific responses to exploit
6. **Skin Manipulation**: Unique Silat technique of grabbing/folding skin for control
7. **Realistic Mindset**: Account for impaired opponents (drugs, alcohol) who don't feel pain normally
