## Notes

**Why This Channel Matters**:
- Bridges traditional/modern divide (Iwama + Shoot Aikido)
- Direct connection to Tony Sargeant (validates teaching lineage)
- Cross-discipline approach provides comparative insights
- Alive training addresses major criticism of Aikido
- Extensive weapons methodology content
- Demonstrates "both/and" rather than "either/or" approach

**Research Value**:
- Resolves kata vs. alive training false dichotomy
- Shows pressure-testing within aikido framework
- Validates weapons training as foundation
- Demonstrates cross-discipline learning
- Provides practical sparring methodology
- Connects to established Iwama lineage (Tony Sargeant)

**Unique Contribution**:
Most aikido content is either traditional OR modern. Alexander demonstrates both coexisting, which supports the user's "both/and" philosophy and validates that criticism of traditional training doesn't require abandoning tradition—just completing the journey to alive application.
