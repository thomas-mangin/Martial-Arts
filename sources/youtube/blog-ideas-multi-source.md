## CITATION TEMPLATE

When writing posts, use this format:

**Single source**:
> "As Christopher Hein teaches, position dictates technique selection..." [Link: "Hein talks about position" - I4yDzkQAbL8]

**Multi-source validation**:
> "All four instructors agree weapons training is foundational. Hein emphasizes how weapons explain WHY techniques exist [Link], Tony focuses on HOW weapons develop correct body movement [Link], Alexander demonstrates progressive training from kata to alive sparring [Link], and SenshinOne shows WHAT internal requirements weapons reveal [Link]."

**Contrasting perspectives**:
> "Interestingly, instructors define 'aiki' quite differently, though these definitions complement rather than contradict. SenshinOne explicitly calls it 'adhesion/seizure' [Link], Hein frames it as 'rhythm and timing' [Link], Tony describes it as 'kokyu projection' [Link], while Alexander implies it through 'becoming part of the weapon' [Link]. Each definition emphasizes a different facet..."
