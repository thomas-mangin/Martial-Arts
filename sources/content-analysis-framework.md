## Universal Analytical Process

### Step 1: Identify Post Type
- Article, interview, tutorial, reflection, announcement?
- Video content, written content, or mixed media?
- Format dictates extraction approach

### Step 2: Extract Structure
- What's the organizational flow?
- How are ideas developed?
- What's the argumentative arc?
- How does it build from start to finish?

### Step 3: Capture Core Content
- **Main Thesis**: What's the central argument or point?
- **Key Points**: 3-5 main ideas (in order of presentation)
- **Supporting Evidence**: Examples, stories, references, demonstrations
- **Conclusions**: What synthesis or takeaway is offered?

### Step 4: Identify Conceptual Elements
- Martial principles or techniques discussed
- Philosophical concepts explored
- Pedagogical insights offered
- Training methods described
- Tensions or debates presented

### Step 5: Extract Quotable Moments
- Particularly insightful statements
- Provocative or debate-worthy claims
- Memorable analogies or metaphors
- Strong positions taken
- Unique perspectives offered

### Step 6: Note Cross-References
- Masters, teachers, or practitioners mentioned
- Classical texts or sources referenced
- Other martial arts compared or contrasted
- Non-martial examples or analogies used
- Historical context provided

### Step 7: Generate Blog Ideas
For each major point or concept:
- **Response angle**: How would you engage with this argument?
- **Alternative perspective**: Is there a different way to view it?
- **Practical extension**: How could this be applied in practice?
- **Deeper exploration**: What questions does it raise?
- **Aikido relevance**: How does this connect to your practice?
- **Comparative analysis**: How does Aikido approach this differently?
- **Audience fit**: Which audience profiles would find this valuable? (See audience-profiles.md)

### Step 8: Assess Blog Potential and Audience Fit
- Which ideas have the most substance?
- Which connect to your personal experience?
- Which would interest your readers?
- Which offer a fresh perspective?
- Which can you add unique value to?
- **Which audiences does each idea serve?** Consider:
  - Experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
  - Role (Student / Instructor / Dojo Owner)
  - Interest focus (Technical / Philosophical / Practical / Historical)
  - Can the idea serve multiple audiences through layered content?
  - Are you covering diverse audience needs over time?

## Key Principles

### 1. Respect Content Depth
- Don't oversimplify complex arguments
- Preserve nuance in extraction
- Capture the full reasoning, not just conclusions
- Acknowledge multiple perspectives presented

### 2. Focus on Extractable Elements
Look specifically for:
- Debate-worthy claims
- Unexplored implications
- Cross-discipline connections
- Practical applications
- Alternative perspectives possible

### 3. Generate Specific Ideas
❌ Not: "Write about martial arts philosophy"
✅ But: "Explore how the concept of mushin (no-mind) manifests differently in Aikido vs. Karate practice"

❌ Not: "Discuss training methods"
✅ But: "Compare solo training effectiveness: Why Aikido traditionally emphasizes partner work while Karate uses kata"

### 4. Consider Your Voice
- How does this connect to YOUR practice?
- What unique perspective can YOU bring?
- What would YOUR readers find valuable?
- What authentic experience can you share?

### 5. Multiple Ideas Per Post
- Rich content can spawn several blog posts
- One response, one extension, one comparative analysis
- Track all ideas, prioritize the best ones
- Don't force ideas from thin content

### 6. Maintain Dialogue
- You're engaging with the community, not just reacting
- Show respect for the source
- Credit ideas appropriately
- Build on rather than just critique
