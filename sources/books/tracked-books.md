## Books to Evaluate

Potential sources mentioned but not yet analyzed for alignment.

### Fight Like a Physicist (Jason Thalken, Ph.D.)
**Published**: 2015
**Focus**: Physics behind martial arts
**Reason for interest**: Scientific approach similar to our framework
**Status**: Not yet evaluated

### Fighting Science: The Laws of Physics for Martial Artists (Martina Sprague)
**Focus**: Physics for martial artists
**Reason for interest**: Physics-based martial arts analysis
**Status**: Not yet evaluated

### On Martial Theory (Steven J. Pearlman) - UPCOMING
**Published**: March 2025
**Author**: Same as "Book of Martial Power"
**Reason for interest**: Follow-up to highly aligned source
**Status**: Track for release, likely high alignment

---

## Not Recommended

Books that don't align with our biomechanics-over-mysticism framework.

*None identified yet - will add as we encounter mysticism-heavy or anti-scientific sources*

## Usage Guidelines

### Citation Hierarchy

**Maximum Authority** (when you need strongest validation):
1. Pearlman - cross-style universal + academic + institutional validation
2. Arus - pure biomechanics science

**Style-Specific Depth**:
1. Gullette, Frantzis - Chinese internal arts
2. Starr - Japanese/Chinese martial mechanics
3. Mitchell - Basic/beginner mechanics

**Multi-Source Validation** (strongest possible):
Cite multiple sources agreeing (e.g., "Pearlman's cross-style analysis, Gullette's internal arts research, and our YouTube instructor synthesis all identify...")

### When to Cite Books vs. YouTube Instructors

**Books**:
- Academic authority needed
- Universal principles across styles
- Theoretical/biomechanical explanation
- Published validation

**YouTube Instructors**:
- Aikido-specific application
- Practical demonstration
- Contemporary teaching approaches
- Multiple perspectives on same topic

**Both**:
- Maximum validation (theory + practice)
- Cross-reference different media types
- Appeal to different learning styles

## Maintenance

**Add new books when**:
- Encountered in research
- Recommended by credible sources
- Align with biomechanics-over-mysticism framework
- Provide cross-validation for our principles

**Update entries when**:
- Complete full analysis
- Use in blog post citations
- Discover new relevant information
- Alignment assessment changes

**Review quarterly** to ensure:
- Active sources still relevant
- New important books haven't been missed
- "To Evaluate" list is being processed
- Citation patterns are effective

*This list supports our research-backed, biomechanics-focused approach to martial arts writing. All sources should ground Aikido in reproducible physical principles rather than mysticism.*
