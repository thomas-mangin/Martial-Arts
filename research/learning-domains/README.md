# Learning Domains Research

**Purpose**: Systematic research into knowledge domains needed for teaching Aikido correctly

**Created**: 2025-11-01

**Approach**: Layered/breadth-first learning (rounded view before depth)

**Phases**: Learning → Analysis → Authoring

## Research Strategy

### WHY Layered/Breadth-First Approach

**Alternative Rejected**: Depth-first (master one domain completely before starting next)

**Rationale for Layered**:
- Prevents over-investment in one area before understanding others
- Reveals connections and overlaps between domains early
- Allows strategic prioritization after seeing full landscape
- Can course-correct approach before too deep
- Builds rounded foundation before specialization

### Layer Structure

**Layer 1** (Current): Core concepts + Essential resources
- 3-5 key concepts per domain
- 2-3 essential learning resources
- Application to Aikido teaching
- WHY these concepts matter

**Layer 2** (Future): Deeper exploration
- Expand each core concept
- Additional resources for depth
- Practical application examples
- Integration with existing knowledge

**Layer 3** (Future): Mastery preparation
- Advanced concepts
- Specialized applications
- Teaching practice integration
- Assessment and validation

**Transition points**: User signals when to go deeper or move to analysis phase

## Research Domains

### Priority 1 Domains (Active Research)

**Status**: Layer 1 in progress

1. **Motor Learning & Skill Acquisition** → `motor-learning.md`
   - Agent 1 researching
   - Focus: How people acquire physical skills

2. **Teaching Methodology & Instructional Design** → `teaching-methodology.md`
   - Agent 2 researching
   - Focus: How to structure and deliver instruction

3. **Sports Psychology for Martial Arts** → `sports-psychology.md`
   - Agent 3 researching
   - Focus: Motivation, confidence, performance psychology

4. **Injury Prevention Science** → `injury-prevention.md`
   - Agent 4 researching
   - Focus: Safe training, common injuries, prevention protocols

### Priority 2 Domains (Pending)

Will research after Priority 1 Layer 1 complete and validated:

5. **Formal Biomechanics Study** (deepen existing strength)
6. **Functional Anatomy** (muscle/joint specifics)
7. **Exercise Physiology** (energy systems, conditioning)
8. **Curriculum Design** (long-term program structure)

---

## Integration

After each layer completes across all active domains:

1. **Review outputs** - Check quality, depth, applicability
2. **Identify connections** - How domains relate and overlap
3. **Create integration document** - Unified view across domains
4. **Present for validation** - User evaluates and guides next steps
5. **Decide next action** - Deeper layer OR new domains OR analysis phase

## Files in This Directory

- `README.md` - This file (overview and strategy)
- `motor-learning.md` - Motor learning & skill acquisition research
- `teaching-methodology.md` - Teaching methodology & instructional design research
- `sports-psychology.md` - Sports psychology for martial arts research
- `injury-prevention.md` - Injury prevention science research
- `integration-layer-1.md` - Integration across all Priority 1 domains (Layer 1)

Additional files will be created as research progresses.
