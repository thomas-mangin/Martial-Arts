## 3. Two-Foot Balance Problem - The Three-Point Stability Issue

**Principle**: Three points define a plane (mathematical stability). Two feet means we're always slightly unstable and constantly making micro-adjustments to maintain balance.

**The Problem**:
- Humans are inherently unstable (two-point contact, not three)
- We constantly shift weight between feet to maintain balance
- There's always a "weaker" direction where we're more vulnerable
- Balance is dynamic process, not static state

**Aikido Applications**:
- Taking balance: push/pull in direction of the "missing leg" (unstable side)
- Why timing matters: catch opponent during weight shift
- Understanding uke's balance points at any moment
- Why different stances have different vulnerability directions

**Teaching Implications**:
- Show students their own balance vulnerabilities in different stances
- Explain why certain directions work better for kuzushi (balance breaking)
- Teach reading uke's weight distribution

## 4. Taking Balance: Direction of the Missing Leg

**Principle**: To disrupt balance, apply force in the direction where the opponent has no support (where a third leg would need to be).

**How It Works**:
- Identify which direction uke is least stable
- Push/pull toward that unstable direction
- Uke cannot plant foot fast enough to recover
- Their natural reaction (hip rotation, ball-of-foot adjustment) can be anticipated and countered

**Natural Counters Uke Will Attempt**:
- **Hip rotation**: Try to rotate hips to shift weight
- **Ball-of-foot rotation**: Pivot on ball of foot to reorient
- Both are predictable and can be incorporated into technique

**Teaching Implications**:
- Train students to read weight distribution
- Show how to find the "missing leg" direction
- Demonstrate how uke's counter-movements can be used
- Timing: act before they complete their recovery adjustment

## 5. Balance on Contact: Never Give It Back

**Principle**: Once you've disrupted uke's balance, maintain that disruption throughout the technique. Giving balance back gives uke opportunity to counter and fight back.

**Why This Matters**:
- Balance = ability to generate power and resistance
- Every moment uke regains balance is a chance to counter
- Continuous kuzushi (unbalancing) from initial contact through completion
- Don't have distinct phases of "break balance, then execute technique"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Breaking balance, then pausing (letting uke recover)
- Technique that allows uke to reestablish stable base mid-movement
- Thinking of balance-breaking as separate step rather than continuous

**Teaching Implications**:
- "Don't let them get their feet under them"
- Show difference between continuous kuzushi and interrupted kuzushi
- Demonstrate how even brief recovery allows counter
- From contact to completion should be unbroken line of imbalance
