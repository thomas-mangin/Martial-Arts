## 1. Leverage - Distance from Pivot Multiplies Strength

**Principle**: The farther from the pivot point you apply force, the greater the rotational effect (torque).

**Aikido Applications**:
- Controlling at the wrist (far from shoulder pivot) vs. elbow (closer to pivot)
- Why small adjustments at contact point create large effects on uke's center
- Why extending uke's arm increases your mechanical advantage
- Joint locks work by creating unfavorable lever ratios for uke

**Teaching Implications**:
- Explain why wrist control is powerful despite small contact point
- Show students how distance from pivot changes difficulty
- Connect to physical progression: beginners need closer contact (body), advanced can use distal contact (hand/wrist)

**Blog Potential**:
- "The Physics of Joint Locks: Why Distance Matters"
- "Why Wrist Control Works: Understanding Leverage in Aikido"
- Integrate into kinetic energy transfer discussions

## 2. Gravity as Power Source/Demultiplicator

**Principle**: Use gravity to generate power rather than fighting against it. Let weight and falling motion do the work.

**Aikido Applications**:
- Dropping weight into technique rather than pushing with arms
- "Falling" techniques where you're already descending
- Why relaxed, weighted movement is more powerful than tense muscular effort
- Timing technique to use uke's falling momentum

**Teaching Implications**:
- "Drop your weight, don't push"
- Demonstrate power difference between muscular effort and gravity-assisted movement
- Show how tension prevents using gravity effectively

**Blog Potential**:
- "Why Relaxation Creates Power: The Role of Gravity in Aikido"
- "Stop Pushing: How to Let Gravity Do the Work"
- Connect to Iwama critique: tension prevents gravity use, relaxation allows it

## 7. Newton's Third Law - Action and Reaction

**Principle**: Every force has an equal and opposite counter-force. If you push someone, you are pushed back equally.

**The Physics**:
