## 12. Target Selection - Hard on Soft, Soft on Hard

**Principle**: Use hard striking surfaces on soft body targets. Use soft striking surfaces on hard body targets. Mismatch = injury to striker.

**The Rule**:
- **Fist (hard) � Soft body** (abdomen, ribs, solar plexus) 
- **Fist (hard) � Skull (hard)** = Broken hand 
- **Palm/Slap (soft) � Face (hard)** 
- **Palm (soft) � Body (soft)** = Less effective but safer 

**Why This Matters**:
- Punching skull breaks hand (boxers break hands even with wraps/gloves)
- Slapping face uses soft palm pad, safer for striker
- Hard targets require softer striking surface or very trained hands
- Untrained hands should avoid hard targets entirely

**Aikido Applications**:
- Why atemi (strikes) in aikido often use palm, not fist
- Face strikes are slaps or palm strikes, not punches
- If targeting hard areas, use redirection instead of impact
- Self-preservation in technique selection

**Teaching Implications**:
- Safety first: Teach appropriate targets for untrained hands
- Explain injury risk to striker, not just effectiveness
- Why traditional aikido uses more palms than fists
- Real self-defense requires understanding what's safe to hit

## 13. Triangle Deflection and Force Redirection - Choosing Your Plane

**Principle**: When two forces meet head-on (like two cars colliding), you can redirect in multiple planes. Triangle positioning plus body movement determines whether force deflects vertically, horizontally, or both.

**The Geometry**:
- Triangle point presents angled surface
- Force hitting angle deflects to side
- Not opposing force directly, redirecting it
- Minimal contact, maximum deflection

**The Two-Car Collision Model**:
- When forces meet head-on, deflection must occur in some direction
- **You choose the plane**: vertical, horizontal, or combination
- Like cars colliding: energy must go somewhere when vectors meet
- Your structure and movement determine where that energy flows

**Horizontal Deflection (Lateral Plane)**:
- Deflect force sideways off centerline
- Allows rotation to face opponent's flank
- Opponent now facing wrong direction
- You maintain facing, they lose orientation
- Example: Entering and turning past attack

**Vertical Deflection - Downward**:
- Use your weight to collapse opponent's guard downward
- Gravity assists the deflection
- Guard collapses under combined forces (their push + your weight)
- Opens upper body targets or creates off-balance
- Example: Pressing down on extended arms

**Vertical Deflection - Upward (Ikkyo Entry)**:
- Deflect force upward and get underneath
- Control elbow while raising their structure
- "Getting under the body" gives structural advantage
- Upward redirection removes grounding
- Then apply elbow control to move person
- Example: Ikkyo rising entry

**Choosing the Deflection Plane**:
- **Situation determines choice**: What's safe? What creates advantage?
- **Horizontal**: When you want to flank/take back position
- **Down**: When collapsing structure/guard creates opening
- **Up**: When getting underneath gives control (ikkyo pattern)
- **Combination**: Often blend vertical and horizontal simultaneously

**Aikido Applications**:
- Hands together in centerline creates deflecting point
- Doesn't block (force opposition), deflects (redirection)
- Body movement determines deflection plane
- Ikkyo = vertical deflection up + get underneath
- Irimi-tenkan = horizontal deflection + rotation
- Some techniques = downward collapse using weight

**Connection to Other Principles**:
- **#19 Upward Redirection**: Specific application of vertical-up deflection
- **#2 Gravity**: Downward deflection uses gravity as assist
- **#25 Hip Rotation + Tai Sabaki**: Horizontal deflection via body turn
- **#9 Body Alignment**: Your structure must support deflection direction

**Teaching Implications**:
- Show geometry of deflection vs. blocking
- Demonstrate force difference: opposition vs. deflection
- Practice coordinating hand position with lateral movement
- **NEW**: Show students the choice - vertical, horizontal, both
- Explain when each deflection plane is advantageous
- Use ikkyo to demonstrate vertical-up clearly

**Why Multiple Planes Matter**:
- One defensive structure, multiple applications
- Adaptability based on situation
- Not locked into single response
- Reading opponent's structure suggests best deflection plane
- Advanced practitioners choose plane instinctively

## 16. Directional Vulnerability - Body's Design Limits

**Principle**: Human body is designed to accept frontal impact. Lateral and rear forces require much less pressure to cause damage because body isn't structurally designed for them.

**The Asymmetry**:
- **Frontal**: Can resist tons of forward pressure (design function)
- **Rear/Lateral**: Very little pressure needed to disrupt structure
- Example: Shoulder pops with light back pressure, resists heavy forward pressure
- Our musculature and skeletal structure favor forward loading

**Why This Matters**:
- Circular attacks exploit this weakness
- Side/rear attacks more effective than frontal
- Less force required when attacking from non-frontal angles
- Body must reorient to resist effectively

**Circular Punches Specifically**:
- Slower than straight punches (longer path)
- But hit from angle body isn't prepared for
- Force comes from unexpected direction
- Why hooks and roundhouse strikes are effective despite being slower

**Aikido Applications**:
- Taking uke's back (rear attack position)
- Circular entries vs. straight entries
- Why even light pressure from side/back is effective
- Tenkan (turning) creates lateral force uke can't resist well

**Teaching Implications**:
- Show students their directional vulnerabilities
- Demonstrate pressure required: front vs. back/side
- Explain why circular techniques work despite being slower
- Practice exploiting directional weakness

## 19. Upward Redirection - Ikkyo Principle

**Principle**: When force comes toward you, an effective way to redirect it is upward. This is the principle behind ikkyo (first teaching/pin).

**The Mechanics**:
- Horizontal force redirected vertically
- Uses opponent's momentum but changes direction
- Lifting removes their base
- Easier to redirect up than to oppose directly

**Why Upward Works**:
- Difficult for attacker to counter upward movement
- Removes grounding (weight lifts off back foot)
- Natural rising motion is hard to resist with downward force
- Vertical redirection takes less energy than horizontal opposition

**Aikido Applications**:
- Ikkyo's rising motion redirects punch/strike upward
- Not blocking, redirecting the vector
- Combines with forward movement (don't just lift)
- Sets up structural control position

**vs. Other Redirections**:
- Downward: Can work but attacker can root
- Lateral: Requires precise angle
- Upward: Generally easiest, removes base

**Teaching Implications**:
- Show that ikkyo isn't "blocking" but "rising deflection"
- Demonstrate upward redirection with different attacks
- Explain vector change concept
- Connect to deflection principles (triangle, angles)

## 20. Joint Vulnerability - Weak Directions in All Martial Arts

**Principle**: All joints have weak directions where they're vulnerable to locks. This is used across all martial arts, not just aikido.

**Universal Principle**:
- Every joint has:
  - **Strong directions**: Can resist significant force
  - **Weak directions**: Minimal force causes pain/damage
- Joint locks exploit weak directions
- Same principle in Aikido, Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Karate, etc.

**Examples**:

**Wrist**:
- Strong: Palmar flexion (bending toward palm side)
- Weak: Dorsal extension (bending back toward forearm), lateral deviation
- Why nikyo, sankyo work

**Elbow**:
- Strong: Flexion (bending), limited extension
- Weak: Hyperextension, lateral pressure
- Why ikkyo, arm bars work

**Shoulder**:
- Strong: Forward rotation, natural range
- Weak: Hyperextension backward, unusual angles
- Why shoulder locks effective with small force

**Knee**:
- Strong: Flexion (bending), limited extension
- Weak: Lateral pressure, hyperextension
- Ground work in many arts

**Why This Matters**:
- Joint locks aren't style-specific - they're anatomical
- Understanding joint mechanics makes all techniques clearer
- Same principles across different martial arts
- Injury prevention: Know your own joint vulnerabilities

**Aikido Applications**:
- All aikido locks use joint weak directions
- Nikyo: Wrist in weak direction
- Sankyo: Wrist rotation in weak direction
- Ikkyo: Elbow hyperextension + shoulder elevation
- Kote-gaeshi: Wrist hyperextension

**Teaching Implications**:
- Explain anatomical basis, not mystical "pressure points"
- Show students their own joint limitations safely
- Biomechanics > tradition in explaining locks
- Safety: Respect joint limits

**Connects to**:
- Leverage principle (Principle #1)
- Hard on soft (Principle #12)
- Universal across martial arts

## 21. Deflect Before Lock - Sequencing and Safety

**Principle**: Don't try to perform locks directly on attacks. First establish safe contact and deflect, THEN apply the lock. With weapons, keep tension point (hands) far from possible knife during deflection phase.

**The Sequence**:
1. **Deflect/Redirect** the attack safely
2. **Establish control** position
3. **Then apply lock** once safe

**NOT**: Try to grab/lock the attacking limb directly

**Why This Matters**:
- Attacking limb is moving fast - hard to catch directly
- Trying to lock during attack = high failure/injury risk
- Deflection creates opportunity for control
- Must neutralize threat before attempting refinement (lock)

**Weapon Context (Critical)**:
- **With knife**: Keep your hands (tension point) FAR from blade during deflection
- Don't reach for knife hand directly
- Deflect the attack vector first
- Only close distance after weapon is controlled/redirected
- Your hands/arms are vulnerable - protect them during deflection phase

**The Problem with Direct Locking**:
- You meet force with force (attack vs. lock attempt)
- Timing must be perfect or you get hit
- No margin for error
- Against weapon = high injury risk

**Safe Sequence**:
- Deflect attack (change vector, use triangle principle)
- Attack passes by (or is redirected upward/sideways)
- Now you have time/space to establish control
- Apply lock from position of control, not from attack phase

**Aikido Applications**:
- Why aikido emphasizes tai sabaki (body movement) first
- Deflection � control � pin is the proper sequence
- Not grab � lock � hope it works
- Timing: Wait for right moment (after deflection, not during attack)

**Knife Defense Specifically**:
- Never reach directly for knife hand
- Deflect the arm trajectory (not the knife itself)
- Keep distance during deflection
- Hands stay far from blade until knife arm is controlled
- Common mistake: Grabbing at knife = getting cut

**Teaching Implications**:
- Teach deflection separately from locking
- Show students the timing difference
- Demonstrate danger of direct lock attempts
- With weapon training: Emphasize distance management
- Practice: Deflect � pause � lock (then speed up gradually)

**Connects to**:
- No defense, only attack on attack (Principle #6)
- Triangle deflection (Principle #13)
- Upward redirection (Principle #19)
- Natural walking/tai sabaki (Principle #14)

## 23. Remove Expected Resistance - Using Tension Against the Attacker

**Principle**: You can use the attacker's expectations against them by making them tense. By removing resistance where they expect it, you can take advantage of their own over-commitment.

**The Mechanism**:
1. Attacker expects resistance at a certain point
2. They brace and tense in preparation to overcome that resistance
3. You suddenly remove the resistance (don't oppose where expected)
4. Their prepared tension causes them to over-commit
5. They lose balance or create opening from their own force

**The Psychology-Biomechanics Connection**:
- Expectation creates physical preparation (tensing)
- Body commits force based on expected resistance
- When resistance disappears, committed force has nowhere to go
- They stumble/overextend from their own momentum
- You didn't overcome their force - you redirected their expectation

**Aikido Applications**:
- When uke pushes expecting resistance, suddenly yield
- They fall forward from their own push
- When uke pulls expecting resistance, suddenly move toward them
- They fall backward from their own pull
- Not opposing their force - exploiting their preparation

**Why This Works**:
- Humans naturally anticipate resistance
- We adjust force based on expected opposition
- Remove the opposition = force goes into empty space
- Like pushing door you thought was locked (suddenly flies open)
- Their own tension becomes the problem, not your technique

**Common Misunderstandings**:
- Not "blending with energy" (mystical)
- Not "harmonizing with ki"
- Simple mechanics: Expected resistance � tension � remove resistance � over-commitment
- Psychological expectation has physical manifestation

**The Timing**:
- Must feel when they commit force
- Too early = they adjust
- Too late = you've already been pushed/pulled
- Perfect timing = right when they've committed but before completion
- This is the "feel" aikido talks about (sensing commitment timing)

**Creating the Expectation**:
- Can actively create expectation by initially providing resistance
- They feel resistance, commit more force to overcome it
- Then suddenly remove it
- They overcommit based on your setup
- Advanced application: Inviting the attack you want

**vs. Direct Opposition**:
- Direct opposition = force vs. force (exhausting)
- Removing expected resistance = using their force against them (efficient)
- Not overpowering them - outsmarting their preparation
- Physical judo using expectations

**Teaching Implications**:
- Explain expectation � tension � commitment cycle
- Practice timing of resistance removal
- Show how same principle works on push, pull, strike
- Demonstrate the "empty door" feeling
- Connect to reading opponent's commitment

**Your Experience**:
- Knife attack: You didn't freeze (no expected victim response)
- Military training: Recognizing preparation and commitment
- First dan: Learning to feel commitment timing
- Not yet fully embodied (Stage 4-5) but understand principle

**Connects to**:
- No defense, only attack on attack (Principle #6) - Timing
- Tension disconnects power (Principle #18) - Their tension used against them
- Deflect before lock (Principle #21) - After they commit
- Triangle deflection (Principle #13) - One method of removal

## 36. The Void - Attacking Where the Body Doesn't React

**Principle**: Apply force to structural weaknesses or in ways that don't trigger the body's protective reflexes. Like attacking into "empty space" where skeletal structure can't effectively respond or where the nervous system doesn't register immediate danger.

**The Concept**:
- Body has reflexive responses to obvious threats (arm lock → pull away)
- Some movements/positions don't trigger these reflexes
- Skeletal structure has weak directions where it can't resist
- "Void" = applying force where body has no immediate counter-response
- Attack completes before body realizes it should react

**Biomechanical Reality**:
- Not mystical "void" - specific structural/neurological reality
- Some joint configurations can't generate resistance
- Some force applications don't register as immediate threats
- Nervous system has reaction delay - exploit this timing gap
- Body's threat assessment affects resistance timing

**Examples of "Void" Applications**:

**Knee Bending While Taking Balance Backward**:
- Knees bend naturally when balance goes backward
- Body doesn't interpret this as immediate threat (no joint danger)
- No reflexive resistance like there would be to arm lock
- By time body realizes imbalance, already falling
- Smooth, non-threatening movement that nonetheless takes balance

**vs. Obvious Threat (Arm Lock)**:
- Body immediately recognizes joint danger
- Instant reflexive pull-away response
- Tension and resistance triggered immediately
- Much harder to complete technique against reflex
- Obvious threat = instant defense response

**Structural Voids - Skeletal Weak Spots**:
- Positions where skeletal structure can't effectively resist
- Not strong/weak muscles - structural geometry problem
- Example: Shoulder raised and forward can't resist downward pressure
- Example: Knee slightly bent sideways can't resist lateral force
- Body is structurally compromised, can't generate counter-force

**Neurological Voids - Non-Threatening Movements**:
- Movements that feel "natural" or non-dangerous
- Body doesn't trigger defensive reflex
- By time threat is recognized, technique already succeeds
- Example: Natural walking rhythm (doesn't trigger alarm)
- Example: Gentle pressure that slowly increases (boiled frog effect)

**Why This Works**:
- Nervous system has processing delay (milliseconds matter)
- Reflexes require threat recognition → signal → response
- Structural weakness means even if body reacts, can't effectively resist
- Non-threatening entry allows technique completion before defense activates
- Exploits gaps in body's defensive systems

**Aikido Applications**:
- Subtle balance taking (doesn't trigger resistance)
- Knee bending during backward kuzushi (feels natural, not threatening)
- Gradual pressure increases (below alarm threshold)
- Exploiting structural weak positions before applying lock
- "Blending" = entering voids where body has no immediate counter

**Connection to Other Principles**:
- **#23 Remove Expected Resistance**: Related but different - this is about expectations, void is about reaction gaps
- **#20 Joint Vulnerability**: Structural voids in skeletal weak directions
- **#4 Taking Balance**: Finding void directions where body can't immediately counter
- **#5 Balance on Contact**: Continuous kuzushi maintains body in reactive void

**Teaching Implications**:
- Explain "void" as structural/neurological reality, not mysticism
- Demonstrate difference: obvious threat vs. void approach
- Show knee-bending backward balance (no reflex) vs. arm lock (instant reflex)
- Practice finding structural voids in partner's positioning
- Timing matters: complete technique before body recognizes threat

**The Timing Element**:
- Void exists in time as well as space
- Body's threat recognition has delay
- Quick technique completion exploits this delay
- Smooth, non-alarming entry prevents early reflex
- Advanced: Create void, then exploit before body adapts

**Why "Void" is Good Terminology**:
- Describes absence of resistance/reaction
- Like attacking empty space where defense isn't present
- Not "weak point" (physical) - it's absence of effective response
- Captures both structural and neurological aspects
- Traditional term with biomechanical reality

**Cross-Discipline Recognition**:
- **Steven Pearlman**: Lists "the void" as fundamental principle
- **Taijiquan**: "Attack where opponent is not"
- **Strategy**: Sun Tzu - attack where undefended
- **Biomechanics**: Exploiting reaction time and structural geometry
- **Neuroscience**: Understanding reflex triggering and delays

**Common Errors**:
- Treating void as mystical concept (it's specific biomechanics)
- Missing the timing element (void disappears if too slow)
- Using obvious threatening movements (triggers defense immediately)
- Not recognizing structural voids (positions where body can't resist)
- Forcing technique instead of finding void

- "Why Some Techniques Don't Trigger Reflexes"

- "Structural Voids: Where Skeleton Can't Resist"
- "The Neurological Gap: Exploiting Reaction Time"
- "Demystifying 'The Void': It's Biomechanics, Not Magic"
- "Why Smooth Techniques Work Better Than Forced Ones"

**Training Methods**:
- Partner drill: Obvious threat (arm lock) vs. void approach (knee bend during backward balance)
- Feel difference in partner's resistance
- Practice finding structural voids in various positions
- Time technique completion before reflex activates
- Study where movements feel "natural" vs. "threatening"

**Observation Note (First Dan Perspective)**:
- I've felt this difference but didn't have framework for it
- Some techniques flow smoothly (hitting voids), others meet instant resistance
- Knee-bending backward is perfect example - never triggers resistance
- Still learning to recognize structural voids consistently
- Understanding "void" as specific biomechanics helps clarify what to look for

**Why This Matters**:
- Explains why "soft" aikido works (exploits voids, doesn't force)
- Removes mysticism from traditional terminology
- Gives practical framework for technique refinement
- Connects traditional wisdom to modern biomechanics/neuroscience
- Foundation for understanding "blending" concept

## 37. Loading the Structure - Preventing Counter-Movement Through Weight

**Principle**: By applying weight/pressure onto opponent's structure, you can prevent them from easily moving their feet to counter your technique. "Loading" their structure grounds them, making them unable to react while you complete the technique.

**The Mechanics**:
- Applying weight onto opponent makes them bear your mass
- Body instinctively shifts to support the added load
- Weight-bearing position makes foot movement difficult/impossible
- Like trying to step while carrying heavy object - body resists movement
- Once loaded, they're effectively pinned without pins

**Why This Works**:
- Body prioritizes stability when bearing weight
- Moving feet while loaded = high risk of collapse
- Nervous system inhibits foot movement to maintain balance
- Knees bend to lower center of gravity (stability response)
- Once knees bent and loaded, extremely difficult to move

**The Sequence (Especially from Behind)**:

**Step 1 - Initial Loading**:
- Put weight/pressure onto opponent's structure
- Push down on shoulders, arms, or upper body
- Their body responds by grounding to support your weight
- Knees begin to bend (lowering center of gravity for stability)

**Step 2 - Shift Center of Gravity**:
- While they're loaded and grounded, pull hands/arms to displace their center
- Center of gravity moves away from base (feet can't follow - they're loaded)
- Now off-balance but can't step to recover (feet pinned by your weight)
- You've created structural instability they can't correct

**Step 3 - Become Part of Their Stability**:
- Push down to help their balance (temporarily)
- They unconsciously rely on your downward pressure for stability
- Knees bend more (body seeking lower, more stable position)
- You're now integrated into their structural balance

**Step 4 - Remove Support and Pull**:
- Suddenly remove the downward pressure AND pull
- Their structure was depending on your weight for stability
- Balance fails catastrophically
- Grounded feet = no way to react or recover
- Technique completes with minimal resistance

**Biomechanical Reality**:
- Loaded structure = inhibited mobility
- Body won't move feet when bearing weight (survival instinct)
- Knees bending = increasing load commitment
- Your weight becomes part of their balance equation
- Removing weight = removing structural support they adapted to

**Why From Behind Works Best**:
- Can't see what you're doing (no visual anticipation)
- Back/posterior muscles weaker than front for resisting
- Natural tendency to lean forward when loaded from behind
- Easy access to shoulders/upper structure for loading
- Their hands/arms can be controlled while loading

**The Physics**:
- **Static friction**: Loaded feet have high static friction (hard to move)
- **Center of gravity displacement**: Moving COM while feet are pinned = guaranteed imbalance
- **Adaptation trap**: They adapt to your weight, then you remove it
- **Reaction inhibition**: Body won't move feet while loaded (too risky)

**Aikido Applications**:
- Rear attacks/controls (loading from behind)
- Pressing down on opponent during technique
- Using your weight as tool, not just strength
- Creating temporary "stability" they rely on, then removing it
- Grounding opponent before off-balancing

**Connection to Other Principles**:
- **#36 The Void**: Loading + then removing = attacking structural void created
- **#23 Remove Expected Resistance**: They expect stability (your weight), you remove it
- **#4 Taking Balance**: Shift COM while feet are pinned by load
- **#2 Gravity**: Using your weight (gravity) as loading tool
- **#9 Body Alignment**: Your structure must support weight delivery

**The Timing Element**:
1. **Load** (weight down) → They ground and stabilize
2. **Shift COM** (pull hands) → Center moves, feet can't follow
3. **Integrate** (push down to "help") → They rely on your pressure
4. **Remove + Pull** (take stability away) → Catastrophic balance failure

**Why This Is Effective**:
- Prevents foot movement (primary balance recovery method)
- Creates structural dependency they don't recognize
- Works with their stability responses, then betrays them
- Minimal strength required (using your weight, not muscle)
- Completes technique before they can react

**Common Errors**:
- Not loading enough weight (they can still move feet)
- Rushing the sequence (must give them time to ground/adapt)
- Not shifting COM during loaded phase (miss the opportunity)
- Forgetting to "help" their balance (don't create dependency)
- Pulling without removing downward pressure first (they're still stable)

**Teaching Implications**:
- Demonstrate loaded vs. unloaded foot movement difference
- Show how knees bend when weight applied (automatic response)
- Practice timing: load → shift → integrate → remove
- Emphasize using weight (gravity) not arm strength
- Explain neurological inhibition against moving loaded feet

**Safety Considerations**:
- Don't load onto joints (shoulders/elbows can be injured)
- Load onto structural areas (shoulders, upper back, hips)
- Control descent (loaded structure + imbalance = hard fall)
- Partner must know to tap if knees/back strain from load
- Practice gradually with increasing weight

**Cross-Discipline Recognition**:
- **Wrestling**: Loading opponent to prevent movement
- **Judo**: Using weight as control tool
- **BJJ**: Weight distribution to pin/control
- **Standing grappling**: Universal principle across all grappling arts

**Why "Loading" is Good Terminology**:
- Describes what's happening biomechanically
- Like loading weight onto structure (engineering concept)
- Explains the grounding effect
- Distinguishes from "pressing" or "pushing"
- Captures the weight-bearing aspect

**The Paradox**:
- You help their balance (push down to stabilize)
- They unconsciously accept this "help"
- Then you remove it while pulling opposite direction
- Their nervous system can't react in time (feet are loaded)
- Like pulling rug out from under someone already leaning on you

- "Becoming Part of Their Balance, Then Destroying It"
- "Why Grounding Your Opponent Makes Them Helpless"
- "The Weight Paradox: Using Your Mass as Control Tool"
- "Knees Bending: The Body's Response to Loading"

**Training Methods**:
- Partner drill: Try to step while someone loads weight on shoulders
- Feel neurological inhibition against foot movement
- Practice four-step sequence slowly: load → shift → integrate → remove
- Vary loading amount to find minimum effective weight
- Video analysis showing knee bending and foot pinning
- Partner feedback on when they feel "trapped"

**Observation Note (First Dan Perspective)**:
- I've felt this when pinned by heavier practitioners
- Feet feel glued to mat when bearing weight
- Didn't understand the sequence until articulating it
- "Helping" their balance (step 3) is subtle but crucial
- Still refining timing - too fast and they haven't committed to load
- Most effective technique I've experienced from rear control

**Why This Matters**:
- Explains how smaller practitioners can control larger ones
- Removes mysticism from "immovable" techniques
- Uses physics (weight/gravity) not strength
- Prevents most common counter (stepping to recover)
- Foundation for understanding grappling control principles

**The Key Insight**:
When you load someone's structure with weight, their body prioritizes stability over mobility. Feet become effectively pinned. While they're loaded and grounded, you can shift their center of gravity away from their base. Then by "helping" their balance with downward pressure, you become integrated into their structural stability. When you remove that support and pull simultaneously, they collapse because: (1) their COM is already displaced, (2) their feet can't move (still loaded), and (3) they adapted to relying on your weight for stability. It's not strength—it's strategic weight application and removal.
