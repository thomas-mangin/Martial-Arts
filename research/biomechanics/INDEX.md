# Biomechanics - Index

**Purpose**: Biomechanical principles grounding Aikido in physics rather than mysticism. Organized thematically for navigation and progressive learning.

**Your Perspective**: First dan - these principles come from training experience, observation, and analysis. They represent current understanding and will evolve with deeper practice.

## The Seven Categories

### 1. Physics Fundamentals (6 principles)
**Universal physical laws that govern all movement**

Principles: Leverage, Gravity, Newton's Third Law, Snap Movement, Surface Area, Weight Transfer Timing

These are the unchanging laws of physics that all martial arts must work with or against.

→ See: `01-physics-fundamentals.md`

---

### 2. Balance Mechanics (3 principles)
**Kuzushi - How humans balance and how to disrupt it**

Principles: Two-Foot Balance Problem, Taking Balance (Direction of Missing Leg), Balance on Contact

The mathematics and biomechanics of human instability and balance disruption.

→ See: `02-balance-mechanics.md`

---

### 3. Static Structure & Alignment (4 principles)
**How to position your body for maximum structural strength**

Principles: Grounding & Connection, Body Alignment, Unbendable Arm, Centerline Positioning, Elbow Structure

Foundational body positioning that creates resilient structure without movement.

→ See: `03-static-structure.md`

---

### 4. Dynamic Body Engagement (4 principles)
**What to engage, what to relax, and how to manage tension**

Principles: Tension Disconnects Power, Vertical Movement Priority, Differential Muscle Engagement, Core Engagement & Internal Pressure

Active body management during movement - the selective engagement that enables both power and adaptability.

→ See: `04-dynamic-engagement.md`

---

### 5. Power Generation & Movement (5 principles)
**How to move and generate force effectively**

Principles: Natural Walking, Foot Mechanics, External Foot Rotation, Hip Rotation Power & Tai Sabaki, Hip-Driven Lateral Movement

The mechanics of generating and transferring power through body movement.

→ See: `05-power-generation.md`

---

### 6. Targeting & Application (7 principles)
**Where and how to apply force for maximum effect**

Principles: Target Selection (Hard on Soft), Triangle Deflection, Directional Vulnerability, Upward Redirection, Joint Vulnerability, Deflect Before Lock, Remove Expected Resistance

Tactical application principles - understanding vulnerabilities and how to exploit them safely.

→ See: `06-targeting-application.md`

---

### 7. Timing & Context (2 principles)
**When to act and why context matters**

Principles: No Defense (Attack on Attack), Weapons Assumption (Why No Hard Blocks)

Strategic and contextual understanding - the meta-level decisions that shape technique selection.

→ See: `07-timing-context.md`

## Learning Progression

**Suggested Reading Order**:

1. **Start Here**: Physics Fundamentals (universal laws)
2. **Then**: Balance Mechanics (human-specific physics)
3. **Build**: Static Structure (positioning)
4. **Add**: Dynamic Engagement (selective tension)
5. **Generate**: Power Generation & Movement (how to move)
6. **Apply**: Targeting & Application (where/how to use force)
7. **Strategize**: Timing & Context (when/why to act)

This progression mirrors the learning journey from fundamental physics through practical application to strategic decision-making.

## Integration with Other Documents

**For Blog Writing**:
- Each principle can be standalone post
- Cross-reference related principles within categories
- Connect to learning-journey.md stages
- 90+ blog post ideas generated from these principles

**For Teaching**:
- Categories suggest natural teaching modules
- Build progressively through categories
- Use cross-discipline examples for validation

**For Training**:
- Physics + Balance = Foundation understanding
- Structure + Engagement = Body mechanics

## Status

**Current Total**: 32 principles documented across 7 categories

**Blog Ideas Generated**: 90+ posts from these principles

**Active Collection**: More principles being gathered as training deepens

---

## Principle Numbering

Principles maintain their original numbers (#1-#32) for continuity and cross-referencing, even though they're now organized thematically rather than sequentially.

**Why**: Existing blog ideas, cross-references, and notes use these numbers. Maintaining them preserves those connections.

---

## Adding New Principles

When documenting new principles:
1. Assign next sequential number (#33, #34, etc.)
2. Determine thematic category
3. Add to appropriate thematic file
4. Update this INDEX.md with new principle
5. Update cross-reference map if principle relates to others

---

*This organization reflects natural thematic groupings that emerged from the material itself. Each category builds on previous ones while maintaining clear boundaries.*
