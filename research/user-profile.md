## Expertise & Perspective

### Acknowledged Limitations

- Permanent shoulder injury (AC joint) managed through training

### Teaching Context

- Actively teaches Jitsu on Tuesdays
- Balances teaching Jitsu with training Aikido

---

## Core Values & Philosophy

### 1. Biomechanics Over Mysticism
- Explains martial arts through physics, anatomy, body mechanics
- Avoids relying on vague "ki" concepts without concrete guidance
- Uses measurable principles: angles, leverage, structure, timing, momentum

### 2. Knowing vs. Embodied Understanding
- Recognizes difference between intellectual knowledge and natural movement
- Understands stages of learning progression
- **Note**: "Stage 4" classification is Claude's framework, not Thomas's - must be defined if referenced

### 3. Peace Through Understanding Violence's Cost
- Military service experience (conscription, not combat)
- Observed PTSD effects in professional soldiers
- Values peace from understanding, not naivety

### 4. Intellectual Honesty Over Ego
- Presents frameworks as working models, not absolute truth
- Explicit about limitations and current learning stage
- Invites dialogue from more experienced practitioners

---

## Writing Approach

### Voice & Positioning
- Advanced student with shodan rank and teaching experience
- Direct lineage to O'sensei through clear teacher chain
- 13 years teaching experience informs instructor perspective
- Multi-art background (Judo, Jitsu, Wing Chun, Aikido) provides broader context
- Technical/analytical approach from computer science and business background

### Can Speak From Direct Experience About
- Jitsu Foundation training and teaching (13 years experience)
- Aikido training in Iwama tradition (7-9 years, shodan level)
- Alexander Gent's teaching methodology (direct student)
- Learning progression from beginner to shodan
- Teaching challenges and approaches
- Training with injuries

### Should NOT Claim

## Important Clarifications

### Learning Stage Framework
- If referencing "Stage 4" or other learning stage classifications, these are **Claude's analytical frameworks**, not Thomas's terminology
- Must be clearly defined when used
- Thomas's actual experience: child judo → restart at 35 (Jitsu) → 7 years → switch to Aikido → 7-9 years → shodan

### Military Background
- **Conscription/service**, not professional military career
- No combat deployment
- Observed PTSD in professionals who deployed (Iraq war, possibly Kosovo)

### Academic Context
- MSc in Computer Science (completed)
- This project is NOT an academic thesis
- Quality standard: MSc-level rigor without academic thesis constraints

### Lineage Accuracy
- **Direct student** of Alexander Gent (not just "alignment" or "following")
- Clear chain: Alexander Gent → Paul Lowing → Tony Sargeant → Saito Morihiro → O'sensei
- Iwama tradition specifically
