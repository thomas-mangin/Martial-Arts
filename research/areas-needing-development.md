### 9. Stance Principles - Stability, Power, and Movement ⭐⭐ VERY HIGH PRIORITY

**Status**: ✅ **FRAMEWORK EXTRACTED** → See `stance-principles.md`

**Summary**: Comprehensive framework covering what makes a good stance (three requirements: stability/power/movement), critical insight that stances are transitions not destinations, jo vs ken stance differences, and empty-hand applications.

**Key Insight**: Stances are transition points in continuous movement - you pass through them, never stop there.

**Ready for**: /discuss session

**Article Potential**: 10+ posts

### 10. Demonstration Robotization Problem - Teaching Trap ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL TEACHING ISSUE

**Status**: ✅ **FRAMEWORK EXTRACTED** → See `demonstration-robotization.md`

**Summary**: Analysis of how repeatedly demonstrating techniques causes teachers to lose the fluidity they're trying to teach. Includes the vicious cycle: rigid demos → rigid students → rigid teachers. Self-perpetuating problem affecting entire aikido community.

**Key Insight**: Demonstration practice (stopping at key points for clarity) contradicts fluid technique (continuous flow). Teachers' muscle memory shifts to rigid demonstration style.

**Ready for**: /discuss session to explore solutions and teaching methods that avoid this trap

**Article Potential**: 9+ posts

---

### 11. Contextual Design of Martial Arts ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK

**Status**: ✅ **FRAMEWORK EXTRACTED** → See `contextual-design-framework.md`

**Summary**: Fundamental philosophical framework explaining that martial arts are designed for specific contexts (threats, environment, time constraints, equipment, culture), not built in a vacuum. Covers 8 specific contexts: Krav Maga (time constraint), Silat (environment), Karambit (protection levels), Ground Fighting (public space), Aikido (weapons), Time Period/Cultural, Legal/Social, and Range/Fight-Ending Strategies.

**Key Principle**: "Effective" always means "effective FOR specific context". What works in one context fails in another by design, not weakness. Resolves "my art is better" arguments by reframing the question.

**Ready for**: /discuss session or direct article writing

**Article Potential**: 25+ posts across core concept, specific contexts, historical/cultural, modern considerations, comparative analysis, and range/strategy

## How to Use This File

**Before Writing Any Article Post**:
1. Check if topic is in "Areas Needing Development" section
2. If yes: Run `/discuss [topic]` first to gather depth
3. If in "Ready to Write": Sufficient material exists, can draft directly

**During Data Gathering**:
- Use `/discuss` for each high-priority topic
- Capture insights in discussions/ directory
- Update this file when topic is sufficiently developed
- Move developed topics to "Ready to Write" section

**Tracking Progress**:
- Use TodoWrite to track which topics have been discussed
- Mark topics complete when sufficient depth achieved
- Update this file as new gaps are identified

---

## Next Steps

**Recommended /discuss sequence:**
1. Weapons training develops biomechanics (foundational to many series)
2. Aikido sword = Wing Chun hands (cross-discipline insight)
3. Circle principle (widely misunderstood, high value)
4. No defense, only attack on attack (resolves peace vs. martial)
5. Taking balance depth (practical application)

After these 5 sessions, reassess what else needs development.
