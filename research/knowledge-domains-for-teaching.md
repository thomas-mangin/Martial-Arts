# Knowledge Domains Needed for Teaching Aikido Correctly

**Purpose**: Map what knowledge is actually needed to teach Aikido well, identify gaps in current knowledge, and define scope boundaries to prevent unlimited learning scope creep.

**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Defining the problem space

---

## Design Decisions & Reasoning Log

### Why This Approach?

**Decision**: Map knowledge domains before identifying learning resources

**Rationale**:
- User pointed out that web searching for textbooks (preliminary biomechanics research) was premature
- Need to understand WHAT we need to learn BEFORE identifying WHERE to learn it
- Risk: Unlimited scope creep ("learn everything about everything")
- Solution: Define boundaries (known→unknown, in-scope→out-of-scope)

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. ❌ Continue domain-by-domain resource searching (rejected - too scattered, no boundaries)
2. ❌ Start with single domain deep-dive (rejected - might not be highest priority)
3. ✅ Map entire landscape first, then prioritize (selected - allows strategic decisions)

---

### Why 7 Domains?

**Decision**: Organized knowledge into 7 core domains

**Rationale**:
- Needed comprehensive coverage without overwhelming granularity
- Domains roughly map to: Technical (what), Pedagogical (how), Scientific (why), Safety (responsibility), Program (structure), Context (application), Professional (development)
- Could have been 3 domains (too coarse) or 15 domains (too fragmented)
- 7 provides navigable structure with clear boundaries

**Note**: This structure is provisional - may need refinement based on actual learning

---

### Assumptions (Document for Future Reference)

**Teaching Context Assumptions** (NOT YET VALIDATED):
- Teaching adults (not children's classes)
- Iwama-style Aikido focus (not Aikikai or other styles)
- Western students (not Japanese cultural context)
- Small/medium dojo context (not large commercial organization)
- In-person teaching (not primarily online)

**User Context Assumptions** (PARTIALLY VALIDATED):
- ✅ Has first aid certification
- ✅ Has read Anatomy Trains (Thomas Myers) - not fully assimilated
- ✅ MSc Computer Science background (high standards for rigor)
- ✅ Veteran background (practical understanding of violence)
- ❓ Current teaching status UNKNOWN (active instructor? planning? timeline?)
- ❓ Teaching authorization status UNKNOWN (rank, permission to teach?)

**Learning Context Assumptions**:
- Can dedicate time to systematic study (not just casual learning)
- Wants MSc-level depth (not surface-level)
- Multiple AI agents available for parallel work
- Article writing can integrate with learning (write as you learn)

**These assumptions affect ALL decisions below - if they're wrong, decisions need revisiting**

---

### Why These Priorities?

**Priority 1: Motor Learning, Teaching Methodology, Sports Psychology, Injury Prevention**

**Rationale**:
- These are CRITICAL GAPS (currently weak/absent)
- Essential for teaching effectively and safely
- Cannot teach well without understanding HOW people learn (motor learning)
- Cannot teach effectively without instructional design (teaching methodology)
- Cannot keep students motivated without understanding psychology
- Cannot teach responsibly without injury prevention knowledge

**Alternative**: Could prioritize deepening biomechanics (existing strength)
**Rejected because**: Diminishing returns on existing strong area while critical gaps remain

**Alternative**: Could prioritize technical syllabus documentation (you already know it)
**Rejected because**: Documentation can happen alongside other learning; knowledge gaps need external sources

---

### Scope Boundaries: Why These Limits?

**Decision**: Define clear IN/OUT boundaries to prevent unlimited learning

**Rationale**:
- User correctly identified risk: "limit our scope or it could go too far"
- Each domain could expand infinitely (PhD-level study in any area)
- Need "good enough to teach well" threshold, not "perfect omniscient knowledge"
- MSc-level rigor ≠ PhD-level comprehensiveness

**Boundary Strategy**:
- **Functional sufficiency**: Know enough to teach effectively, not enough to be world expert
- **Refer out when needed**: Know when to send students to doctors, therapists, etc.
- **Applied focus**: Prioritize applicable knowledge over theoretical completeness
- **80/20 rule**: 20% of knowledge provides 80% of teaching effectiveness

**Examples of boundaries**:
- Anatomy: Functional understanding, not memorizing all 600+ muscles
- Psychology: Sports psychology basics, not clinical diagnosis
- Biomechanics: Applied principles, not advanced mathematical modeling
- Japanese: Technical terminology, not fluency

**Risk**: Boundaries too tight → inadequate knowledge
**Mitigation**: Can expand boundaries if teaching reveals gaps

---

### Open Questions Requiring Clarification

**User Context** (affects priorities and timeline):
1. Are you currently teaching Aikido actively?
2. If not current, timeline for starting? (months? years?)
3. What's your rank/authorization to teach?
4. Teaching context: own dojo, assistant, club, private lessons?
5. Student demographics: age range, experience levels, class sizes?

**Learning Approach** (affects agent design):
1. ✅ Simultaneous learning confirmed (parallel agents)
2. How much time available for study vs. article writing?
3. Should agents produce learning summaries or full educational content?
4. Integration strategy: how do 4 parallel agent outputs combine?
5. Success criteria: how do we know agent research was sufficient?

**Scope Validation**:
1. ✅ Domain map looks good (LGTM)
2. ✅ Scope boundaries look good (LGTM)
3. ✅ Priorities look good (LGTM)
4. Any domains completely unnecessary for your context?

---

### Integration Strategy (How Pieces Fit Together)

**Challenge**: 4 agents researching in parallel → need coherent output

**Strategy** (DRAFT - needs refinement):
1. Each agent researches one Priority 1 domain
2. Outputs: Key concepts + applicable principles + recommended resources
3. Integration: Combine into unified teaching framework
4. Cross-reference: Identify overlaps and connections between domains
5. Practical synthesis: Create actionable teaching guidance from theory

**Questions**:
- Should agents coordinate during research or work independently?
- Should agents produce standardized output format?
- Who/what does integration? (Another agent? Manual review?)
- How to handle contradictions between sources?

---

### Success Criteria (How We Know This Is Working)

**For This Document**:
- ✅ User validates domain map (LGTM received)
- ✅ User validates scope boundaries (LGTM received)
- ✅ User validates priorities (LGTM received)
- ❓ Open questions answered (teaching context clarified)

**For Parallel Learning Agents** (to be defined):
- Each agent identifies 3-5 core concepts for their domain
- Each agent recommends 2-3 essential learning resources
- Output is actionable (can apply to teaching immediately)
- Depth is sufficient (MSc-level rigor, not superficial)
- Integration is clear (concepts connect across domains)

**For Overall Learning Process**:
- Can teach more effectively than before (subjective, user assessment)
- Can explain WHY techniques work (biomechanics integration)
- Can structure effective lessons (teaching methodology applied)
- Can motivate students (sports psychology applied)
- Can prevent injuries (safety protocols implemented)

**Long-term** (months):
- Articles demonstrate deeper pedagogical understanding
- Teaching practice improves (if applicable)
- Students learn more effectively (if teaching)

---

### Evolution of Thinking (How We Got Here)

**Session Start**: User requested "identify good material to learn from"

**First Attempt** (FAILED):
- Did preliminary web searches for biomechanics textbooks
- Compiled list of resources
- Declared task "complete" after 5-10 minutes
- User correctly called out: premature, superficial, not actual "identification"

**Course Correction**:
- User: "we need to go from known known to unknown unknown"
- User: "let's try to document what we want to gather good info about"
- Shifted approach: Map the problem space BEFORE identifying solutions

**Current Approach**:
- Map what knowledge is needed for teaching Aikido correctly
- Identify gaps between current knowledge and needed knowledge
- Define scope boundaries (prevent infinite learning)
- Prioritize learning domains
- THEN identify resources (next step)

**Key Insight**: Resource identification is meaningless without understanding what knowledge is actually needed and why
