## Loading Strategy

**Don't load all files at once** - this defeats the token optimization!

**Instead:**
1. Start with session-context.md to see current topic
2. Load only the research file(s) relevant to that topic
3. Agents will read files internally as needed
4. Reference this INDEX when you need to know what's available
