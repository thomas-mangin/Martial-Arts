## Directory Purpose

The research/ directory serves as the **foundation** for all blog content:
- Ensures authentic voice aligned with your beliefs and experience
- Provides technical frameworks for blog post development
- Tracks topics that need deeper exploration before writing
- Documents audience profiles for targeted content

**Key Principle**: Write from research, not from generic knowledge. Your unique voice comes from your specific frameworks, experiences, and analytical approach.

## File Categories

### 1. Foundational Philosophy (Read These First)

These files establish WHO you are as a martial artist and writer:

#### **core-values.md** - Your Fundamental Beliefs
- Teaching philosophy (biomechanics over mysticism)
- Mastery framework (knowing vs. embodied understanding)
- Physical progression (5 stages: hands→feet→timing→core→patterns)
- Background (military, knife attack, veteran observations)
- Honest positioning (first dan, not great fighter)
- Iwama approach critique (structure good, relaxation often missing)

**When to use**: Before writing any blog post - check alignment with your stated beliefs

#### **divisive-topics.md** - Community Debates & Controversies
- 8 major martial arts debates with your nuanced positions
- Aikido-specific: Peace vs. martial, Iwama vs. blending, Ki vs. biomechanics
- General: Kata vs. alive training, traditional vs. modern, competition
- Cross-discipline: Hard vs. soft styles, weapons vs. empty hand

**When to use**: When writing about controversial topics - ensure balanced, nuanced perspective

#### **learning-journey.md** - Mastery Stages & Progression
- Knowing (intellectual) vs. Embodied (natural movement)
- Physical progression framework (5 stages detailed)
- Pattern recognition development
- Kata as alphabet (not scripture)
- Blog ideas about learning and plateaus

**When to use**: When writing about learning, progression, teaching methods, or skill development

## Workflow: Research → Blog

### Before Writing Any Blog Post

1. **Check Foundational Files**:
   - core-values.md - Am I staying consistent with my beliefs?
   - divisive-topics.md - If controversial, am I showing nuance?
   - learning-journey.md - Does learning progression framework apply?

2. **Find Technical Content**:
   - Major frameworks (contextual-design, weapons-training, stance-principles, demonstration-robotization)
   - biomechanical-principles.md (specific principles)
   - areas-needing-development.md (check if topic needs /discuss first)

3. **Target Audiences**:
   - audience-profiles.md - Identify 3-5 reader profiles this post serves

### If Topic Needs Development

1. Check areas-needing-development.md - Does topic need /discuss?
2. Run `/discuss [topic]` to explore through conversation
3. Extract discussion to blog draft with `/extract`
4. Develop draft using research frameworks
5. Review with `/review-aikido` for quality

### If Topic Is Ready

1. Use frameworks and principles directly
2. Write from template (blog/blog-template.md)
3. Follow guidelines (blog/blog-guidelines.md)

## Key Principles

### 1. Research Grounds Writing
Your blog posts should reference research frameworks, not generic advice. This makes your voice authentic and distinctive.

### 2. Consistency Matters
Check core-values.md before writing to ensure you're not contradicting established beliefs without acknowledgment.

### 3. Frameworks Evolve
These are living documents. Update them as understanding deepens through /discuss sessions and writing.

### 4. Cross-Reference Frequently
Frameworks reference each other. Follow connections to enrich blog content.

### 5. Honesty Over Ego
First dan perspective, learning alongside readers, not claiming ultimate mastery. This honesty is your strength.
