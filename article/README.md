# Article Guidelines & Templates

**Note**: This directory contains article writing **guidelines and templates**, not the articles themselves. Actual article content is in `/articles/`.

## Purpose

This directory provides reference materials for writing educational article series:
- Writing standards and best practices
- Article templates
- Voice and authenticity guidelines
- Series structure planning
- Legacy engagement techniques (optional reference)

## Key Files

### Active Guidelines
- **article-guidelines.md** - Comprehensive writing standards for educational articles
- **article-template.md** - Template for starting new articles
- **article-voice-guide.md** - Maintaining authentic voice and perspective
- **article-series-structure.md** - Planning and organizing article series

### Legacy Reference (Optional)
- **blog-engagement-techniques-LEGACY.md** - Engagement-focused techniques (NOT aligned with current educational depth approach)

## Workflow

For writing articles, see:
1. Start with `/discuss [topic]` to explore ideas
2. Use `/extract` to transform discussion into draft (saves to `/articles/`)
3. Refer to guidelines in this directory while developing article
4. Use `/review-aikido` for quality review before finalizing

## Directory Distinction

- **`/article/`** (this directory) = Guidelines, templates, reference materials
- **`/articles/`** = Actual article content organized by series
- **`/discussions/`** = Informal topic explorations before extraction

*Consider this your "article writing toolkit" with all the reference materials you need.*
