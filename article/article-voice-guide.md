## Quick Reference

**Before writing any article**:
1. Check decisions.md for your foundational values and writing style
2. Reference this guide for framing language and common pitfalls
3. Identify which learning stages you can speak to authentically

**Your Position**: First dan (shodan) - experienced but still progressing

**Your Strength**: Close enough to beginner struggles to remember them, far enough along to have useful perspective

## Writing from First Dan Perspective

### What You Can Speak To

**Stages 1-3** (Direct Personal Experience):
- Learning hand techniques
- Developing footwork and whole-body coordination
- Understanding timing and flow
- Copying forms and internalizing patterns

**Stage 4** (Emerging Understanding):
- Core/hip initiation (currently working through this)
- The shift from external to internal movement
- When power increases without added effort

**Stage 5** (Observation):
- Pattern recognition across techniques
- How advanced practitioners move
- What master-level looks like (observed, not embodied)

**Ultimate Mastery**:
- Cannot claim to fully understand yet
- Observe from outside, don't speak as authority

### Framing Language

**✅ USE** (Authentic, Humble):
- "In my experience so far..."
- "What I've observed is..."
- "My current understanding..."
- "From observing more advanced practitioners..."
- "What I've experienced at my level..."
- "In my training up to this point..."
- "Based on my journey through first dan..."

**❌ AVOID** (False Authority):
- "This is definitely how mastery works..."
- "All masters do X..." (claiming to understand fully)
- "The only way to achieve Y..."
- Writing as if you've achieved ultimate mastery
- Claiming certainty about stages you haven't fully embodied

### Example Transformations

**Too Authoritative**:
> "Mastery requires moving from the core, not the hands."

**Better (Authentic)**:
> "In my training so far, I've noticed that advanced practitioners initiate movement from their core rather than their hands. I'm currently working to develop this myself, and even the emerging understanding changes how techniques feel."

**Too Certain**:
> "Stage 5 is when pattern recognition becomes automatic."

**Better (Honest)**:
> "From observing more advanced practitioners, it appears that pattern recognition becomes more automatic around Stage 5. I haven't reached that level yet, but watching senior students suggests this is where principles start transcending specific forms."

## Presenting Frameworks

### Your Frameworks Are Working Models

**Remember**:
- Frameworks are based on observation and current understanding
- They will evolve as understanding deepens
- Different perspectives can coexist
- You're sharing useful patterns, not absolute truth

### How to Frame Frameworks

**✅ GOOD**:
- "I've found this framework helpful for understanding..."
- "One way to think about this is..."
- "In my analysis of [topic], I've observed..."
- "This model has helped me make sense of..."

**❌ AVOID**:
- "This is the definitive framework for..."
- "Everyone must progress exactly this way..."
- "This is the only valid perspective..."

**Always Include**:
- Invitation for dialogue: "What's been your experience?"
- Acknowledgment of limitations: "This is my current understanding..."
- Recognition of other perspectives: "Different lineages may approach this differently..."

## Maintaining Honesty

### About Fighting Ability

**The Truth**: You understand biomechanics well but aren't a great fighter

**How to Write About This**:
- Separate technical understanding from fighting prowess
- Both have value, they're just different things
- Can teach biomechanics without claiming elite fighter status

**✅ AUTHENTIC**:
> "I'm not a great fighter, and I won't pretend to be. But understanding biomechanics has given me insights into why techniques work that I can share, even if I wouldn't win competitions."

**❌ MISLEADING**:
> Implying competition success or fighting prowess you don't have
> Avoiding the topic and hoping readers assume elite ability

### About Real Experience

**What You CAN Reference**:
- Knife attack defense (pre-training) - pressure response
- Military training (French mountain infantry) - physical intensity
- Veteran observations - relationship to violence and peace

**What You DON'T Claim**:
- Great fighter status
- Combat sports competition success
- Years of street fighting
- Military combat deployment

**Be Specific**:
> "Before I started aikido, I was attacked with a knife. I didn't have technique, but I learned I don't freeze under pressure. That experience taught me the gap between knowing moves and functioning under threat."

This is specific, honest, and valuable without exaggerating.

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before publishing any article, verify:

### Perspective Check
- [ ] Am I writing from first dan perspective (not master)?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged uncertainty about advanced stages?
- [ ] Am I speaking from experience for Stages 1-3?
- [ ] Am I clearly marking Stage 4-5 as observation/emerging?

### Language Check
- [ ] Using "In my experience..." type framing?
- [ ] Avoiding false certainty claims?
- [ ] Inviting dialogue and other perspectives?
- [ ] Presenting frameworks as models, not absolute truth?

### Honesty Check
- [ ] Being honest about fighting ability (or not claiming it)?
- [ ] Grounding in real experiences I actually had?
- [ ] Not exaggerating or implying false expertise?
- [ ] Separating technical knowledge from prowess?

### Authenticity Check
- [ ] Would this be believable to someone who knows me?
- [ ] Am I staying true to my actual experience level?
- [ ] Does this sound like me, or like a guru?
- [ ] Is this genuinely helpful or just impressive-sounding?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Guru Voice
**Problem**: Writing as if you're an enlightened master

**Solution**: Stay grounded in your actual journey, acknowledge limitations

### Theoretical Knowledge Without Grounding
**Problem**: Explaining concepts you haven't personally worked through

**Solution**: Be clear about what's observation vs. lived experience

### Vague Mysticism
**Problem**: Using energy/ki language without biomechanical translation

**Solution**: Explain the physical mechanics, reference biomechanical principles

### Over-Certainty
**Problem**: Claiming definitive answers about advanced stages

**Solution**: Present as current understanding, working model, or observation

### Fake Toughness
**Problem**: Implying fighting prowess you don't have

**Solution**: Be honest about understanding vs. performance ability

## Practical Application

### Starting a New Post

1. **Check your topic**: Which learning stages does it touch?
2. **Identify your authority level**: Experience, emerging, or observation?
3. **Choose appropriate framing**: Language that matches your actual knowledge
4. **Reference source frameworks**: Link to decisions.md and research/ files
5. **Maintain consistency**: Use this guide's language examples

### During Writing

1. **Catch false authority**: When you write "X is definitely...", ask "Do I know that from experience?"
2. **Add uncertainty acknowledgments**: "In my understanding so far..."
3. **Invite dialogue**: "What's been your experience with this?"
4. **Ground in real experience**: When possible, tie to actual training moments

### Before Publishing

1. **Run through checklist** (above)
2. **Read aloud**: Does this sound authentic or impressive-seeking?
3. **Verify cross-references**: Links to decisions.md and research/ correct?
4. **Final honesty check**: Would this be credible to someone who knows you?

## Audience Considerations

### Different Readers Need Different Framing

**Beginners** (Stages 1-2):
- Your close experience is valuable
- Can explain clearly what you remember
- Avoid overwhelming with advanced concepts

**Intermediate** (Stages 3-4):
- Peer-level conversation
- Share current struggles authentically
- "Here's what I'm working on too..."

**Advanced** (Stages 4-5):
- Honest about observation vs. experience
- Ask questions, invite correction
- Value their deeper understanding

**Instructors**:
- Share teaching insights from observation
- Acknowledge they have more direct experience
- Contribute analytical frameworks

See research/audience-profiles.md for complete audience analysis.

## Tone Examples

### Too Guru-Like (Avoid)
> "True mastery transcends the physical realm. When you finally understand the ki flow, all techniques become effortless. Those who haven't experienced this cannot comprehend."

**Problems**: Claims ultimate understanding, vague mysticism, dismissive of those "who don't get it"

### Better (Authentic)
> "I've noticed that when I focus less on muscular effort and more on structural alignment, techniques work better. I'm still learning this - some days it clicks, some days I revert to forcing things. From watching senior students, it seems this gets more natural with time."

**Why**: Honest about current struggle, specific not vague, acknowledges learning process

### Too Certain (Avoid)
> "All aikido progression follows exactly these five stages in this exact order. Every practitioner will experience Stage 4 as the critical breakthrough."

**Problems**: Over-certainty, ignores individual variation, claims universal truth

### Better (Honest)
> "Based on my observations and training, I've noticed what seems to be a pattern of progression through roughly five stages. My experience and watching others suggests Stage 4 is often a significant shift, but I imagine different people's journeys vary. This framework has helped me make sense of my own learning, and I'm curious if others see similar patterns."

**Why**: Presented as observation/model, acknowledges variation, invites dialogue
