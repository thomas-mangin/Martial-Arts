# Article Series Structure

**Purpose**: Organize articles into progressive learning series so readers can build understanding systematically rather than through random content. Each series builds on previous concepts, creating clear learning pathways designed for book publication.

**Your Approach**: "I would like to write articles in series so that a reader can take things progressively."

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31

## Why Series Structure Matters

**Benefits**:
- Readers can follow clear learning path
- Each post builds on previous concepts
- Can reference earlier articles in series
- Creates narrative through-line
- Encourages readers to return for next installment
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Can package series into guides/ebooks later

**How to Use This**:
- Choose a series based on what interests you
- Write articles in order within series
- Reference previous articles when building on concepts
- Series can run in parallel (work on multiple series)
- Mark completion status to track progress

## Series Writing Strategy

### Approach 1: Complete One Series
- Focus on single series, write all articles in order
- Maintains momentum and consistency
- Readers get complete learning path quickly
- Example: Complete Biomechanics Foundations (6 articles)

### Approach 2: Parallel Series
- Work on multiple series simultaneously
- Alternate between series to avoid burnout
- Provides variety in writing
- Example: Article1 from Biomechanics, Article1 from Learning Journey, Article1 from Peace/Violence

### Approach 3: Priority-Based
- Write highest-value articles from each series first
- Mix foundational with advanced
- Balance technical with philosophical
- Example: One biomechanics, one personal experience, one teaching

### Recommended: Start with Approach 1

Choose one series and complete it. Builds writing momentum, creates clear value for readers, establishes credibility. Suggest starting with:
- **Biomechanics Foundations** (technical strength)
- **Peace and Violence** (unique personal perspective)
- **The Learning Journey** (broadly applicable)
