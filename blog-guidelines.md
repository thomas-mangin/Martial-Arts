# Blog Writing Guidelines

## Structure Overview

Your Aikido blog posts should follow a clear, engaging structure that serves both practitioners and newcomers to the art.

---

## 1. Title & Metadata

## 2. Introduction (100-200 words)

**Purpose**: Hook readers and set expectations

**Elements to include:**

**Good opening patterns:**

## 3. Main Content (500-1500 words)

**Structure**: 2-4 major sections with descriptive headings

## Review Philosophy: Critical & Collaborative

### Expect Rigorous Feedback

When you use `/review-aikido`, expect **high standards and direct, critical feedback**. This is MA-level work, not casual blogging.

**The review will:**
- Point out weaknesses directly without sugar-coating
- Challenge vague statements, unsupported claims, and clichés
- Ask probing questions to push your thinking deeper
- Identify where writing is generic or lacks depth
- Hold you to standards of precision, clarity, and insight
- Not accept "good enough" - push for excellence

### Work Collaboratively on Improvements

Reviews are the start of a conversation, not a final judgment.

**The collaborative process:**
1. **Receive critical feedback** - Understand what needs improvement and why
2. **Ask questions** - Clarify feedback you don't understand
3. **Discuss options** - Work through multiple revision approaches
4. **Revise iteratively** - Make improvements section by section
5. **Re-review** - Get feedback on revisions until the post reaches excellence
6. **Keep iterating** - Multiple review rounds are normal and encouraged

### What "MA-Level Quality" Means

**Content depth:**
- Goes beyond surface-level information
- Offers genuine insight, not just facts
- Shows critical thinking about Aikido concepts
- Draws on personal experience meaningfully
- Challenges or expands conventional understanding

**Writing quality:**
- Every sentence serves a purpose (no padding)
- Examples are specific and illustrative
- Terminology is precise and correctly used
- Arguments are supported with evidence or reasoning
- Voice is authentic and engaging

**Structure:**
- Introduction hooks and sets up the exploration
- Sections build logically on each other
- Transitions are smooth and purposeful
- Conclusion synthesizes, doesn't just summarize
- Every paragraph advances the main idea

### Embrace the Critical Process

**This approach will:**
- Produce significantly better final posts
- Deepen your critical thinking about Aikido
- Develop your writing and analytical skills
- Ensure your posts offer real value to readers
- Build a body of work you can be proud of

**Remember:** Critical feedback is not personal criticism. It's a tool for achieving excellence. Welcome it as an opportunity to make your work stronger.

## Writing Process Tips

1. **Start with outline**: Plan your sections before writing
2. **Draft freely**: Get ideas down without over-editing
3. **Let it sit**: Come back with fresh eyes before finalizing
4. **Read aloud**: Catches flow issues and awkward phrases
5. **Get feedback**: Use the review command
6. **Revise**: Based on feedback, improve clarity and accuracy
7. **Final check**: Spelling, formatting, links

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too technical**: Balance detail with accessibility
- **Too vague**: Be specific with examples
- **Preaching**: Share insights, don't lecture
- **Overusing Japanese**: English clarity first
- **Lack of personal voice**: Include your perspective
- **No clear takeaway**: What should readers remember?
- **Poor organization**: Ensure logical flow
- **Unsupported claims**: Back up assertions
