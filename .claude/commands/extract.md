# Extract - Transform Discussion into Blog Post Draft

You are helping the user extract key insights from a discussion note and create an initial blog post draft.

## Purpose

Transform raw, exploratory discussion notes into structured blog post drafts that:
- Preserve authentic insights from the discussion
- Organize ideas into blog-appropriate structure
- Maintain the user's voice and perspective
- Provide a strong starting point for refinement
- Reference the original discussion for context

## Process

This is **NOT** a final blog post. This is a **first draft** that:
- Pulls best ideas from discussion
- Structures them logically
- Adds blog-appropriate framing
- Identifies gaps that need filling
- Creates foundation for iterative improvement

## Steps to Execute

### 1. **Read the Discussion Note**
- User provides: `/extract discussions/[filename].md`
- Read the entire discussion note carefully
- Understand: topic, key insights, examples, questions, decisions

### 2. **Analyze Blog Potential**
Identify:
- **Core thesis**: What's the main insight or argument?
- **Key points**: What are the 2-4 main ideas?
- **Best examples**: Which stories/examples are most illustrative?
- **Target audiences**: Who will this serve? (From discussion note or infer from content - see research/audience-profiles.md)
- **Audience value**: What will each audience type gain from this?
- **Structure**: What's the logical flow?
- **Gaps**: What's missing or needs development?
- **Angle**: What's the unique perspective?

### 3. **Choose Blog Category**
Determine which category fits best:
- **Technique**: Specific waza analysis
- **Philosophy**: Principles and concepts
- **Training**: Practice methods and tips
- **History**: Lineage and development
- **Personal Reflection**: Journey and insights

### 4. **Assess Readiness**
Is there enough material for a blog post?

**If YES** (sufficient insights, clear direction):
- Proceed to extract

**If PARTIAL** (good ideas but needs more):
- Offer to extract what exists OR
- Suggest continuing discussion first
- Ask user which they prefer

**If NO** (too thin, unclear direction):
- Recommend more discussion first
- Suggest specific areas to explore
- Don't force extraction from insufficient material

### 5. **Create Blog Post Draft**
**Filename**: `posts/[topic-name]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Copy blog/blog-template.md structure and fill it in:

#### Title
- Specific and engaging
- Based on core insight from discussion
- Examples:
  - Good: "The Hidden Power of Soft Ukemi"
  - Bad: "Thoughts on Ukemi"

#### Metadata
- Date: Today
- Author: [User's name if known, or [Your Name]]
- Category: [From step 3]
- Primary Audience: [1-2 audience profiles from analysis in step 2]
- Secondary Audiences: [2-3 additional profiles who will benefit]
- Audience Notes: [What each audience type will gain - brief summary]
- Estimated Length: [Based on content depth: 800-1200 / 1200-1800 / 1800+ words]

#### Introduction (100-200 words)
- **Hook**: Start with compelling question, story, or observation from discussion
- **Context**: Why this topic matters
- **Preview**: What reader will learn
- **Voice**: Maintain conversational tone from discussion

#### Main Content (500-1500 words)
Transform discussion insights into 2-4 structured sections:

**For each section**:
- **Heading**: Descriptive, specific (not "Section 1")
- **Core idea**: The insight from discussion (in user's voice)
- **Explanation**: Develop the idea clearly
- **Example**: Use concrete examples from discussion
- **Application**: How it applies in practice

**Flow**:
- Sections should build on each other
- Smooth transitions between ideas
- Logical progression from setup to insight

#### Practical Takeaways (3-5 points)
Extract actionable insights:
- What can readers do with this?
- What should they remember?
- What can they apply immediately?

**Consider tiering by audience level** (see blog/blog-template.md and blog/blog-guidelines.md):
- For Beginners: Foundational actions
- For Intermediate/Advanced: Refinement practices
- For Instructors: Teaching insights (if applicable)

Format as bulleted list with brief explanations

#### Conclusion (100-150 words)
- **Synthesize**: Tie main points together
- **Return**: Reference opening hook or question
- **Perspective**: Broader significance
- **Forward-looking**: Invitation to explore further

Don't just summarize - add synthesis.

### 6. **Add Extraction Notes**
At the TOP of the blog post draft, add:

```markdown
<!-- EXTRACTION NOTES
Source: discussions/[filename].md
Extracted: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: First Draft - Needs Development

Gaps to Fill:
- [What's missing or needs expansion]
- [Areas that need more examples]
- [Technical details to verify]

Next Steps:
1. Review and expand thin sections
2. Add Japanese terminology if appropriate
3. Verify any factual claims
4. Check flow and transitions
5. Run /review-aikido when ready

Reference: This draft is based on informal discussion.
Original insights preserved in source file.
-->
```

### 7. **Update Discussion Note**
Add to top of original discussion file:

```markdown
**Status**: Extracted → `posts/[filename].md` (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

### 8. **Update topics.md**
Add or update topic in topics.md:
- Move to "Current Topic" section
- Note that initial draft exists

### 9. **Provide User Guidance**
Tell the user:

```
✅ Blog post draft created: posts/[filename].md

📝 What I extracted:
- [Main insight 1]
- [Main insight 2]
- [Main insight 3]

⚠️ What needs work:
- [Gap or weakness 1]
- [Gap or weakness 2]

📖 Current word count: ~[XXX] words (target: 800-1200)

🎯 Suggested next steps:
1. Read the draft
2. Expand [specific section]
3. Add [specific element]
4. Run /review-aikido posts/[filename].md when ready

Would you like to:
A) Review the draft together now
B) Work on a specific section
C) Continue discussing to fill gaps
D) Let me know what needs attention
```

## Extraction Quality Standards

### Voice and Authenticity
- **Preserve user's voice**: Use their phrasing where possible
- **Keep authenticity**: Don't make it overly formal
- **Personal perspective**: Maintain first-person insights
- **Natural tone**: Conversational but polished

### Structure and Clarity
- **Logical flow**: Ideas build progressively
- **Clear sections**: Each section has distinct purpose
- **Good transitions**: Smooth connections between ideas
- **Focused**: Stay on main thesis

### Content Depth
- **Specific examples**: Concrete over abstract
- **Sufficient depth**: Beyond surface level
- **Coherent argument**: Main point well-supported
- **Actionable**: Practical value for readers

### What to Include
✅ Best insights from discussion
✅ Concrete examples and stories
✅ User's authentic observations
✅ Questions that drive exploration
✅ Connections to broader principles
✅ Practical applications

### What to Exclude
❌ Tangents that don't support main point
❌ Excessive uncertainty (preserve some)
❌ Redundant ideas (combine similar points)
❌ Inside jokes or overly personal references
❌ Unverified factual claims (flag for checking)

## Handling Different Discussion Types

### Rich, Complete Discussions
- Extract directly to full draft
- Structure is clear
- Most sections can be well-developed
- May be close to ready for review

### Partial Discussions
- Extract what exists
- Clearly mark gaps
- Suggest specific areas for expansion
- May need more discussion or independent writing

### Exploratory Discussions
- Multiple possible angles
- Ask user which direction to take
- May extract focused subset
- Other insights saved for future posts

### Technical Discussions
- Ensure terminology is accurate
- Add glossary if many Japanese terms
- Verify technique descriptions
- May need more precise details

## Integration with Workflow

**After extraction**:
1. User reviews draft
2. User expands/refines as needed
3. User adds missing elements
4. When ready: `/review-aikido posts/[filename].md`
5. Iterate based on critical feedback
6. Repeat review until MA-level quality
7. Mark complete in topics.md

## Important Notes

### This is a Draft
- Don't expect perfection
- Gaps are normal and expected
- Structure might need adjustment
- Multiple revisions are part of the process

### Preserve Original Discussion
- Never delete discussion notes
- They remain as reference
- May feed multiple posts
- Can be revisited for more extraction

### User Still Drives Content
- Extraction provides structure, not final content
- User owns the ideas and insights
- User refines and develops the draft
- Extraction reduces "blank page" problem

### Quality Expectations
- **Extraction**: Should be coherent and structured
- **Not yet**: MA-level quality (that comes through iteration)
- **Goal**: Strong starting point that preserves key insights

## When NOT to Extract

Don't extract if:
- Discussion is too thin (< 3-4 substantial insights)
- No clear main point or thesis
- Mostly questions without insights
- User indicates they're not ready
- Would result in < 400 word draft

Instead: Recommend more discussion or brainstorming first.

## Examples of Extraction Decisions

### Good Extraction
Discussion has:
- Clear central insight about irimi timing
- 3-4 supporting observations
- Personal story about breakthrough
- Specific training applications
- Coherent thread through conversation

→ Extract to: "Understanding the Moment: When to Enter in Aikido"

### Needs More Discussion
Discussion has:
- General thoughts about training mindset
- Scattered observations
- No clear thesis
- Mostly questions
- Thin on examples

→ Suggest: Continue discussion focusing on specific aspect

### Multiple Post Potential
Discussion has:
- Rich exploration of ukemi
- Technical aspects (one post)
- Philosophical dimensions (another post)
- Teaching approaches (third post)

→ Ask user which angle to extract first

## Remember

Extraction is translation: from exploratory conversation to structured draft. Preserve the gems, add structure, identify gaps, create foundation for excellence.

The blog post quality comes from iteration and review, not from extraction alone.
