# Extract - Transform Discussion into Blog Post Draft

You are helping the user extract key insights from a discussion note and create an initial blog post draft.

## Purpose

Transform raw, exploratory discussion notes into structured blog post drafts that:
- Preserve authentic insights from the discussion
- Organize ideas into blog-appropriate structure
- Maintain the user's voice and perspective
- Provide a strong starting point for refinement
- Reference the original discussion for context

## Process

This is **NOT** a final blog post. This is a **first draft** that:
- Pulls best ideas from discussion
- Structures them logically
- Adds blog-appropriate framing
- Identifies gaps that need filling
- Creates foundation for iterative improvement

## Steps to Execute

### 1. **Read the Discussion Note**
- User provides: `/extract discussions/[filename].md`
- Read the entire discussion note carefully
- Understand: topic, key insights, examples, questions, decisions

### 2. **Analyze Blog Potential**
Identify:
- **Core thesis**: What's the main insight or argument?
- **Key points**: What are the 2-4 main ideas?
- **Best examples**: Which stories/examples are most illustrative?
- **Target audiences**: Who will this serve? (From discussion note or infer from content - see research/audience-profiles.md)
- **Audience value**: What will each audience type gain from this?
- **Structure**: What's the logical flow?
- **Gaps**: What's missing or needs development?
- **Angle**: What's the unique perspective?

### 3. **Choose Blog Category**
Determine which category fits best:
- **Technique**: Specific waza analysis
- **Philosophy**: Principles and concepts
- **Training**: Practice methods and tips
- **History**: Lineage and development
- **Personal Reflection**: Journey and insights

### 4. **Assess Readiness**
Is there enough material for a blog post?

**If YES** (sufficient insights, clear direction):
- Proceed to extract

**If PARTIAL** (good ideas but needs more):
- Offer to extract what exists OR
- Suggest continuing discussion first
- Ask user which they prefer

**If NO** (too thin, unclear direction):
- Recommend more discussion first
- Suggest specific areas to explore
- Don't force extraction from insufficient material

### 5. **Create Blog Post Draft**
**Filename**: `posts/[topic-name]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Copy blog/blog-template.md structure and fill it in:

#### Title
- Specific and engaging
- Based on core insight from discussion
- Examples:
  - Good: "The Hidden Power of Soft Ukemi"
  - Bad: "Thoughts on Ukemi"

#### Metadata
- Date: Today
- Author: [User's name if known, or [Your Name]]
- Category: [From step 3]
- Primary Audience: [1-2 audience profiles from analysis in step 2]
- Secondary Audiences: [2-3 additional profiles who will benefit]
- Audience Notes: [What each audience type will gain - brief summary]
- Estimated Length: [Based on content depth: 800-1200 / 1200-1800 / 1800+ words]

#### Introduction (100-200 words)
- **Hook**: Start with compelling question, story, or observation from discussion
- **Context**: Why this topic matters
- **Preview**: What reader will learn
- **Voice**: Maintain conversational tone from discussion

#### Main Content (500-1500 words)
Transform discussion insights into 2-4 structured sections:

**For each section**:
- **Heading**: Descriptive, specific (not "Section 1")
- **Core idea**: The insight from discussion (in user's voice)
- **Explanation**: Develop the idea clearly
- **Example**: Use concrete examples from discussion
- **Application**: How it applies in practice

**Flow**:
- Sections should build on each other
- Smooth transitions between ideas
- Logical progression from setup to insight

#### Practical Takeaways (3-5 points)
Extract actionable insights:
- What can readers do with this?
- What should they remember?
- What can they apply immediately?

**Consider tiering by audience level** (see blog/blog-template.md and blog/blog-guidelines.md):
- For Beginners: Foundational actions
- For Intermediate/Advanced: Refinement practices
- For Instructors: Teaching insights (if applicable)

Format as bulleted list with brief explanations

#### Conclusion (100-150 words)
- **Synthesize**: Tie main points together
- **Return**: Reference opening hook or question
- **Perspective**: Broader significance
- **Forward-looking**: Invitation to explore further

Don't just summarize - add synthesis.

### 6. **Add Extraction Notes**
At the TOP of the blog post draft, add:

```markdown
<!-- EXTRACTION NOTES
Source: discussions/[filename].md
Extracted: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: First Draft - Needs Development

Gaps to Fill:
- [What's missing or needs expansion]
- [Areas that need more examples]
- [Technical details to verify]

Next Steps:
1. Review and expand thin sections
2. Add Japanese terminology if appropriate
3. Verify any factual claims
4. Check flow and transitions
5. Run /review-aikido when ready

Reference: This draft is based on informal discussion.
Original insights preserved in source file.
-->
```

### 7. **Update Discussion Note**
Add to top of original discussion file:

```markdown
**Status**: Extracted ‚Üí `posts/[filename].md` (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

### 8. **Update topics.md**
Add or update topic in topics.md:
- Move to "Current Topic" section
- Note that initial draft exists

### 9. **Provide User Guidance**
Tell the user:

```
‚úÖ Blog post draft created: posts/[filename].md

üìù What I extracted:
- [Main insight 1]
- [Main insight 2]
- [Main insight 3]

‚ö†Ô∏è What needs work:
- [Gap or weakness 1]
- [Gap or weakness 2]

üìñ Current word count: ~[XXX] words (target: 800-1200)

üéØ Suggested next steps:
1. Read the draft
2. Expand [specific section]
3. Add [specific element]
4. Run /review-aikido posts/[filename].md when ready

Would you like to:
A) Review the draft together now

```

## Extraction Quality Standards

### Voice and Authenticity
- **Preserve user's voice**: Use their phrasing where possible
- **Keep authenticity**: Don't make it overly formal
- **Personal perspective**: Maintain first-person insights
- **Natural tone**: Conversational but polished

### Structure and Clarity
- **Logical flow**: Ideas build progressively
- **Clear sections**: Each section has distinct purpose
- **Good transitions**: Smooth connections between ideas
- **Focused**: Stay on main thesis

### Content Depth
- **Specific examples**: Concrete over abstract
- **Sufficient depth**: Beyond surface level
- **Coherent argument**: Main point well-supported
- **Actionable**: Practical value for readers

### What to Include
‚úÖ Best insights from discussion
‚úÖ Concrete examples and stories
‚úÖ User's authentic observations
‚úÖ Questions that drive exploration
‚úÖ Connections to broader principles
‚úÖ Practical applications

### What to Exclude
‚ùå Tangents that don't support main point
‚ùå Excessive uncertainty (preserve some)
‚ùå Redundant ideas (combine similar points)
‚ùå Inside jokes or overly personal references
‚ùå Unverified factual claims (flag for checking)

## Handling Different Discussion Types

### Rich, Complete Discussions
- Extract directly to full draft
- Structure is clear
- Most sections can be well-developed
- May be close to ready for review

### Partial Discussions
- Extract what exists
- Clearly mark gaps
- Suggest specific areas for expansion
- May need more discussion or independent writing

### Exploratory Discussions
- Multiple possible angles
- Ask user which direction to take
- May extract focused subset
- Other insights saved for future posts

### Technical Discussions
- Ensure terminology is accurate
- Add glossary if many Japanese terms
- Verify technique descriptions
- May need more precise details

## Integration with Workflow

**After extraction**:
1. User reviews draft
2. User expands/refines as needed
3. User adds missing elements
4. When ready: `/review-aikido posts/[filename].md`
5. Iterate based on critical feedback
6. Repeat review until MA-level quality
7. Mark complete in topics.md

## Important Notes

### This is a Draft
- Don't expect perfection
- Gaps are normal and expected
- Structure might need adjustment
- Multiple revisions are part of the process

### Preserve Original Discussion
- Never delete discussion notes
- They remain as reference
- May feed multiple posts
- Can be revisited for more extraction

### User Still Drives Content
- Extraction provides structure, not final content
- User owns the ideas and insights
- User refines and develops the draft
- Extraction reduces "blank page" problem

### Quality Expectations
- **Extraction**: Should be coherent and structured
- **Not yet**: MA-level quality (that comes through iteration)
- **Goal**: Strong starting point that preserves key insights

## When NOT to Extract

Don't extract if:
- Discussion is too thin (< 3-4 substantial insights)
- No clear main point or thesis
- Mostly questions without insights
- User indicates they're not ready
- Would result in < 400 word draft

Instead: Recommend more discussion or brainstorming first.

## Examples of Extraction Decisions

### Good Extraction
Discussion has:
- Clear central insight about irimi timing
- 3-4 supporting observations
- Personal story about breakthrough
- Specific training applications
- Coherent thread through conversation

‚Üí Extract to: "Understanding the Moment: When to Enter in Aikido"

### Needs More Discussion
Discussion has:
- General thoughts about training mindset
- Scattered observations
- No clear thesis
- Mostly questions
- Thin on examples

‚Üí Suggest: Continue discussion focusing on specific aspect

### Multiple Post Potential
Discussion has:
- Rich exploration of ukemi
- Technical aspects (one post)
- Philosophical dimensions (another post)
- Teaching approaches (third post)

‚Üí Ask user which angle to extract first

## Remember

Extraction is translation: from exploratory conversation to structured draft. Preserve the gems, add structure, identify gaps, create foundation for excellence.

The blog post quality comes from iteration and review, not from extraction alone.
