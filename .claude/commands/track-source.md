# Track Source - Register Martial Arts Bloggers

You are helping the user track martial arts bloggers and maintain their source registry.

## Purpose

Create and maintain profiles for martial arts bloggers whose content the user wants to monitor for:
- Inspiration and ideas
- Points worthy of response
- Alternative perspectives to explore
- Community engagement
- Content quality references

## Steps to Execute

### 1. **Gather Source Information**

If user provides all info inline:
```
/track-source "Leo Tamaki" "https://www.leotamaki.com" "Aikido"
```

If user only provides name or partial info, ask for:
- **Name**: Full name of the blogger/author
- **URL**: Primary blog or website URL
- **Discipline**: Martial art they practice/teach (Aikido, Karate, etc.)
- **Language**: Primary language of their content (optional)
- **Focus**: What they mainly write about (optional, can be added later)

### 2. **Check if Source Exists**

- Generate filename: Convert name to lowercase-kebab-case (e.g., "Leo Tamaki" ‚Üí "leo-tamaki")
- Check if `sources/registry/[filename].md` already exists
- If exists: Ask if user wants to update it
- If new: Proceed to create

### 3. **Fetch Initial Information** (Optional)

If URL is provided, use WebFetch to get initial context:
- Check if the blog is active
- Identify recent post titles (if visible)
- Get a sense of their writing style and topics
- This helps populate the profile better

### 4. **Ask Contextual Questions**

To create a useful profile, ask:
- **Why tracking?** "What interests you about [name]'s work?"
- **Focus areas?** "What do they typically write about? (technique, philosophy, training methods, history, etc.)"
- **Language?** "What language is their content in?"
- **Notes?** "Any particular reason you want to track them? (similar perspective, different discipline, inspiring writing, etc.)"
- **Active?** "Is this an active blog or historical archive?"

### 5. **Create Source Profile**

Create file: `sources/registry/[name-kebab-case].md`

**Format**:

```markdown
# [Full Name]

**URL**: [Blog URL]
**Discipline**: [Martial art]
**Language**: [Primary language]
**Status**: Active | Inactive | Unknown

‚úÖ Source tracked: [Name]

üìÅ Profile saved: sources/registry/[filename].md

üìã Summary:
- Name: [Full name]

üìù You can manually edit the profile to add:

```

### 7. **Update Source Registry Index** (Optional)

Create or update `sources/registry/INDEX.md` with list of all tracked sources:

```markdown
# Tracked Sources

Total sources: [count]

| Name | Discipline | Status | Last Scanned | Ideas Generated |
|------|------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| [Name 1] | [Discipline] | Active | [Date] | [Count] |
| [Name 2] | [Discipline] | Active | [Date] | [Count] |

## By Discipline

### Aikido
- [Name 1] - [URL]
- [Name 2] - [URL]

### Karate
- [Name 1] - [URL]

### Other
- [Name 1] - [Discipline] - [URL]

---

*Use `/track-source [name] [url] [discipline]` to add new sources*
*Use `/scan-sources` to check all sources for new content*
```

## Important Guidelines

### Source Selection
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on bloggers with substantial content
- **Diverse perspectives**: Include different disciplines and viewpoints
- **Active sources**: Prioritize blogs that publish regularly
- **Accessible**: Must be in a language the user can read/translate

### Profile Quality
- **Be specific**: Vague notes aren't helpful later
- **Context matters**: Why is this source worth tracking?
- **Connection**: How does it relate to user's work?
- **Honesty**: Note both agreements and disagreements

### Updating Profiles
If source already exists:
- Ask what to update
- Preserve scan history
- Update change log
- Don't overwrite custom notes

### Filename Convention
- Lowercase only
- Use hyphens for spaces
- No special characters
- Examples:
  - "Leo Tamaki" ‚Üí `leo-tamaki.md`
  - "Lionel Froidure" ‚Üí `lionel-froidure.md`
  - "O'Sensei Archive" ‚Üí `o-sensei-archive.md`

## Integration with Workflow

After tracking a source, user can:
1. **Scan immediately**: `/scan-sources [name]`
2. **Scan later**: `/scan-sources` (scans all)
3. **Manual review**: Visit the blog directly and add notes to profile
4. **Update profile**: Re-run `/track-source` with updated info

## Examples

### Example 1: Full Information Provided
```
User: /track-source "Leo Tamaki" "https://www.leotamaki.com" "Aikido"

Assistant actions:
1. Create sources/registry/leo-tamaki.md
2. Use WebFetch to check the blog
3. Ask contextual questions about why tracking
4. Create complete profile
5. Confirm creation
6. Suggest running /scan-sources leo-tamaki
```

### Example 2: Minimal Information
```
User: /track-source "Lionel Froidure"
Assistant actions:
1. Ask: "What's the blog URL?"
2. Ask: "What martial art does Lionel practice?"
3. Ask: "Why do you want to track him?"
4. Create profile with gathered info
5. Confirm and guide next steps
```

### Example 3: Updating Existing Source
```
User: /track-source "Leo Tamaki" (already exists)

Assistant actions:
1. Detect existing profile
2. Ask: "Leo Tamaki is already tracked. What would you like to update?"
3. Update specified fields
4. Preserve scan history
5. Add entry to change log
```
