# Track Source - Register Martial Arts Content Creators

You are helping the user track martial arts content creators (bloggers, YouTube channels) and maintain their source registry.

## Purpose

Create and maintain profiles for martial arts content creators whose work the user wants to monitor for:
- Inspiration and ideas
- Points worthy of response
- Alternative perspectives to explore
- Community engagement
- Content quality references

## Content Types Supported

1. **Blogs/Websites**: Traditional written content
2. **YouTube Channels**: Video content creators

## Steps to Execute

### 1. **Detect Content Type**

Check the URL to determine if it's a blog or YouTube channel:
- **YouTube Channel**: URL contains `youtube.com/@` or `youtube.com/c/` or `youtube.com/channel/`
  - Create profile in `sources/youtube/registry/[name].md`
  - Use YouTube channel template (simpler format)
  - Reference `/youtube-fetch` for video analysis
- **Blog/Website**: All other URLs
  - Create profile in `sources/registry/[name].md`
  - Use full blog tracking template
  - Reference `/scan-sources` for content monitoring

### 2. **Gather Source Information**

If user provides all info inline:
```
/track-source "Leo Tamaki" "https://www.leotamaki.com" "Aikido"
/track-source https://www.youtube.com/@Tony_Sargeant
```

If user only provides name or partial info, ask for:
- **Name**: Full name of the creator/channel
- **URL**: Primary URL (blog or YouTube channel)
- **Discipline**: Martial art they practice/teach (Aikido, Karate, etc.)
- **Language**: Primary language of their content (optional, for blogs)
- **Focus**: What they mainly create about (optional, can be added later)

### 3. **Check if Source Exists**

- Generate filename: Convert name to lowercase-kebab-case (e.g., "Leo Tamaki" ‚Üí "leo-tamaki", "Tony Sargeant" ‚Üí "tony-sargeant")
- **For YouTube**: Check if `sources/youtube/registry/[filename].md` already exists
- **For Blogs**: Check if `sources/registry/[filename].md` already exists
- If exists: Ask if user wants to update it
- If new: Proceed to create

### 4. **Fetch Initial Information**

**For Blogs**: Use WebFetch to get initial context:
- Check if the blog is active
- Identify recent post titles (if visible)
- Get a sense of their writing style and topics
- This helps populate the profile better

**For YouTube Channels**: Use youtube-channel-info.py script to extract channel information:
- Run: `python scripts/youtube-channel-info.py "<channel_url>"`
- Script extracts:
  - Channel name and ID
  - Subscriber count
  - Recent video titles (up to 10)
  - Video view counts and durations
- Analyze video titles to determine:
  - Martial art discipline (Aikido, Karate, etc.)
  - Content themes (technique, philosophy, training, competition)
  - Teaching style/approach
- Use this information to populate the channel profile

### 5. **Ask Contextual Questions** (If Needed)

After fetching initial information, ask additional questions if needed:
- **Why tracking?** "What interests you about [name]'s work?"
- **Additional focus areas?** (If not clear from fetch) "What else should I know about their content?"
- **Notes?** "Any particular reason you want to track them?"

**For Blogs Only**:
- **Language?** "What language is their content in?" (YouTube can detect from fetch)
- **Active?** "Is this an active blog or historical archive?" (YouTube channels show activity)

### 6. **Create Source Profile**

Create file: `sources/registry/[name-kebab-case].md`

### 8. **Update Source Registry Index** (Optional)

Create or update `sources/registry/INDEX.md` with list of all tracked sources:

```markdown
# Tracked Sources

Total sources: [count]

| Name | Discipline | Status | Last Scanned | Ideas Generated |
|------|------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| [Name 1] | [Discipline] | Active | [Date] | [Count] |
| [Name 2] | [Discipline] | Active | [Date] | [Count] |

---

## By Discipline

### Aikido
- [Name 1] - [URL]
- [Name 2] - [URL]

### Karate
- [Name 1] - [URL]

### Other
- [Name 1] - [Discipline] - [URL]

---

*Use `/track-source [name] [url] [discipline]` to add new sources*
*Use `/scan-sources` to check all sources for new content*
```

## Important Guidelines

### Source Selection
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on bloggers with substantial content
- **Diverse perspectives**: Include different disciplines and viewpoints
- **Active sources**: Prioritize blogs that publish regularly
- **Accessible**: Must be in a language the user can read/translate

### Profile Quality
- **Be specific**: Vague notes aren't helpful later
- **Context matters**: Why is this source worth tracking?
- **Connection**: How does it relate to user's work?
- **Honesty**: Note both agreements and disagreements

### Updating Profiles
If source already exists:
- Ask what to update
- Preserve scan history
- Update change log
- Don't overwrite custom notes

### Filename Convention
- Lowercase only
- Use hyphens for spaces
- No special characters
- Examples:
  - "Leo Tamaki" ‚Üí `leo-tamaki.md`
  - "Lionel Froidure" ‚Üí `lionel-froidure.md`
  - "O'Sensei Archive" ‚Üí `o-sensei-archive.md`

## Integration with Workflow

After tracking a source, user can:
1. **Scan immediately**: `/scan-sources [name]`
2. **Scan later**: `/scan-sources` (scans all)
3. **Manual review**: Visit the blog directly and add notes to profile
4. **Update profile**: Re-run `/track-source` with updated info

## Examples

### Example 1: Full Information Provided
```
User: /track-source "Leo Tamaki" "https://www.leotamaki.com" "Aikido"

Assistant actions:
1. Create sources/registry/leo-tamaki.md
2. Use WebFetch to check the blog
3. Ask contextual questions about why tracking
4. Create complete profile
5. Confirm creation
6. Suggest running /scan-sources leo-tamaki
```

### Example 2: Minimal Information
```
User: /track-source "Lionel Froidure"
Assistant actions:
1. Ask: "What's the blog URL?"
2. Ask: "What martial art does Lionel practice?"
3. Ask: "Why do you want to track him?"
4. Create profile with gathered info
5. Confirm and guide next steps
```

### Example 3: Updating Existing Source
```
User: /track-source "Leo Tamaki" (already exists)

Assistant actions:
1. Detect existing profile
2. Ask: "Leo Tamaki is already tracked. What would you like to update?"
3. Update specified fields
4. Preserve scan history
5. Add entry to change log
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid URL

- Still useful for historical content

### Language Barrier
