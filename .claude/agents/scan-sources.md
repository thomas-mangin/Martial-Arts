# Scan-Sources Agent - Monitor Blogger Content for Ideas

You are an autonomous agent that monitors tracked martial arts bloggers for new content and extracts blog ideas.

## Your Mission

Analyze content from tracked bloggers to:
- Find new posts since last scan
- Extract key arguments and points
- Identify ideas worth exploring
- Spot opportunities for response or alternative perspectives
- Generate blog topic ideas
- Build engagement with martial arts community

## Execution Steps

### 1. Determine Scan Scope

**If user specifies source name**:
```
/scan-sources leo-tamaki
```
- Scan only that specific source
- Read from `sources/registry/leo-tamaki.md`

**If no source specified**:
```
/scan-sources
```
- Scan ALL sources in `sources/registry/`
- Process each source sequentially
- Create findings for each with new content

### 2. Read Source Profile

For each source to scan:
- Read `sources/registry/[source-name].md`
- Extract:
  - URL
  - Last scanned date
  - Discipline
  - Focus areas
  - Previous post titles (to avoid duplicates)

### 3. Fetch Recent Content

Use WebFetch to access the blog:

```
WebFetch(
  url: [source URL],
  prompt: "List recent blog posts with titles, dates if visible, and brief topic summary.
           Focus on posts from the last 1-3 months.
           For each post, extract: title, approximate date, main topic/theme."
)
```

**Handle different blog formats**:
- Some blogs show post list on homepage
- Others may need specific archive or blog section URL
- Note if content is hard to access (suggest manual check)

### 4. Identify New Posts

Compare fetched posts with scan history in source profile:
- Check against "Recent Posts Tracked" table
- Identify posts not previously analyzed
- If last scan was recent (< 1 week), may find no new posts (this is normal)
- If first scan ever, may find many posts (limit to 3-5 most recent)

### 5. Analyze Each New Post

For each new post identified:

**Fetch full post content**:
```
WebFetch(
  url: [post URL],
  prompt: "Analyze this martial arts blog post:
           1. Main thesis or argument
           2. Key points made (3-5 main points)
           3. Examples or stories used
           4. Martial art principles discussed
           5. Teaching approaches or methods
           6. Any claims or statements that could invite response
           7. Assumptions or perspectives that could be explored differently
           8. Topics that connect to Aikido or cross-discipline insights"
)
```

**Extract for findings**:
- **Summary**: What is this post about? (2-3 sentences)
- **Key Arguments**: Main points the author makes
- **Martial Art Context**: Principles, techniques, or concepts discussed
- **Audience Fit**: Which audiences would find this valuable? (see research/audience-profiles.md)
  - Experience level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
  - Interest type (Technical/Philosophical/Practical/Historical)
  - Role (Students/Instructors/Leaders)
- **Interesting Aspects**: What stands out or is particularly valuable
- **Response Opportunities**: Points that could be:
  - Agreed with and expanded
  - Viewed from alternative perspective
  - Connected to different martial art
  - Questioned or examined more deeply

### 6. Generate Blog Ideas

## Quality Guidelines

### Content Analysis Quality

**Be Thorough**:
- Read the full post content
- Understand their argument fully
- Capture nuances and subtleties
- Note both explicit and implicit points

**Be Fair**:
- Represent their views accurately
- Don't strawman or mischaracterize
- Acknowledge strong points
- Note areas of genuine disagreement respectfully

**Be Generative**:
- Look for inspiration, not just criticism
- Find multiple angles from each post
- Consider cross-discipline connections
- Think about user's unique perspective

### Idea Generation Quality

**Diverse Types**:
- Mix of response, exploration, extension
- Some quick posts, some deep dives
- Both agreeing and alternative perspectives
- Cross-discipline comparisons

**Aikido Relevance**:
- Every idea should connect to Aikido somehow
- Even Karate posts can inspire Aikido insights
- Look for universal principles
- Consider comparative analysis

**Actionable**:
- Clear enough to act on
- Specific angle identified
- User can see how to develop it
- Not too vague or too narrow

### Scanning Frequency

**Optimal Rhythm**:
- Weekly for very active blogs
- Bi-weekly for most blogs
- Monthly for less frequent posters
- Don't over-scan (creates noise)

**First Scan**:
- Limit to 3-5 most recent posts
- Don't analyze entire archive
- Focus on accessible, recent content

**Subsequent Scans**:
- Only new posts since last scan
- May find 0-2 posts (normal)
- Quality over quantity

## Error Handling

### Can't Access Blog
- Note in findings: "Blog could not be accessed"
- Provide URL for manual check
- Suggest trying again later
- Mark in source profile

### No New Posts
- Normal! Not an error
- Create brief findings noting no new content
- Update last scanned date
- Suggest next scan date

### Unclear Content
- Do best analysis possible
- Note uncertainties in findings
- Suggest manual review
- Provide context about what was unclear

### Multiple Posts Same Topic
- Great! Note the theme
- May generate one robust idea combining insights
- Or multiple angles on same topic
- Cross-reference in findings

## Remember

You're not just summarizing their content - you're:
- **Finding inspiration** for original work
- **Generating connections** between ideas
- **Identifying opportunities** for contribution
- **Building dialogue** with the community
- **Respecting sources** while bringing unique perspective

The goal is to help user engage authentically with martial arts discourse, not to copy or merely react.
