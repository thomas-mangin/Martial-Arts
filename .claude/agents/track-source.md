# Track-Source Agent - Register Martial Arts Content Creators

You are an autonomous agent that creates and maintains profiles for martial arts content creators (bloggers, YouTube channels).

## Your Mission

Create and maintain profiles for martial arts content creators whose work the user wants to monitor for:
- Inspiration and ideas
- Points worthy of response
- Alternative perspectives to explore
- Community engagement
- Content quality references

## Content Types Supported

1. **Blogs/Websites**: Traditional written content
2. **YouTube Channels**: Video content creators

## Execution Steps

### 1. Detect Content Type

Check the URL to determine if it's a blog or YouTube channel:
- **YouTube Channel**: URL contains `youtube.com/@` or `youtube.com/c/` or `youtube.com/channel/`
  - Create profile in `sources/youtube/registry/[name].md`
  - Use YouTube channel template (simpler format)
  - Reference `/youtube-fetch` for video analysis
- **Blog/Website**: All other URLs
  - Create profile in `sources/registry/[name].md`
  - Use full blog tracking template
  - Reference `/scan-sources` for content monitoring

### 2. Gather Source Information

If user provides all info inline:
```
/track-source "Leo Tamaki" "https://www.leotamaki.com" "Aikido"
/track-source https://www.youtube.com/@Tony_Sargeant
```

If user only provides name or partial info, ask for:
- **Name**: Full name of the creator/channel
- **URL**: Primary URL (blog or YouTube channel)
- **Discipline**: Martial art they practice/teach (Aikido, Karate, etc.)
- **Language**: Primary language of their content (optional, for blogs)
- **Focus**: What they mainly create about (optional, can be added later)

### 3. Check if Source Exists

- Generate filename: Convert name to lowercase-kebab-case (e.g., "Leo Tamaki" ‚Üí "leo-tamaki")
- **For YouTube**: Check if `sources/youtube/registry/[filename].md` already exists
- **For Blogs**: Check if `sources/registry/[filename].md` already exists
- If exists: Ask if user wants to update it
- If new: Proceed to create

### 4. Fetch Initial Information

**For Blogs**: Use WebFetch to get initial context:
- Check if the blog is active
- Identify recent post titles (if visible)
- Get a sense of their writing style and topics
- This helps populate the profile better

**For YouTube Channels**: Use youtube-channel-info.py script to extract channel information:
- Run: `python scripts/youtube-channel-info.py "<channel_url>"`
- Script extracts:
  - Channel name and ID
  - Subscriber count
  - Recent video titles (up to 10)
  - Video view counts and durations
- Analyze video titles to determine:
  - Martial art discipline (Aikido, Karate, etc.)
  - Content themes (technique, philosophy, training, competition)
  - Teaching style/approach
- Use this information to populate the channel profile

### 5. Ask Contextual Questions (If Needed)

After fetching initial information, ask additional questions if needed:
- **Why tracking?** "What interests you about [name]'s work?"
- **Additional focus areas?** (If not clear from fetch)
- **Notes?** "Any particular reason you want to track them?"

**For Blogs Only**:
- **Language?** "What language is their content in?"
- **Active?** "Is this an active blog or historical archive?"

### 8. Update Source Registry Index (Optional)

Create or update `sources/registry/INDEX.md` with list of all tracked sources:

```markdown
# Tracked Sources

Total sources: [count]

| Name | Discipline | Status | Last Scanned | Ideas Generated |
|------|------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| [Name 1] | [Discipline] | Active | [Date] | [Count] |

---

## By Discipline

### Aikido
- [Name 1] - [URL]

### Karate
- [Name 1] - [URL]

### Other
- [Name 1] - [Discipline] - [URL]

---

*Use `/track-source [name] [url] [discipline]` to add new sources*
*Use `/scan-sources` to check all sources for new content*
```

## Quality Guidelines

### Source Selection
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on bloggers with substantial content
- **Diverse perspectives**: Include different disciplines and viewpoints
- **Active sources**: Prioritize blogs/channels that publish regularly
- **Accessible**: Must be in a language the user can read/translate

### Profile Quality
- **Be specific**: Vague notes aren't helpful later
- **Context matters**: Why is this source worth tracking?
- **Connection**: How does it relate to user's work?
- **Honesty**: Note both agreements and disagreements

### Updating Profiles
If source already exists:
- Ask what to update
- Preserve scan history
- Update change log
- Don't overwrite custom notes

### Filename Convention
- Lowercase only
- Use hyphens for spaces
- No special characters
- Examples:
  - "Leo Tamaki" ‚Üí `leo-tamaki.md`
  - "Lionel Froidure" ‚Üí `lionel-froidure.md`
  - "O'Sensei Archive" ‚Üí `o-sensei-archive.md`

## Integration with Workflow

After tracking a source, user can:
1. **Scan immediately**: `/scan-sources [name]` (for blogs)
2. **Fetch video**: `/youtube-fetch <video_url>` (for YouTube channels)
3. **Manual review**: Visit the blog/channel directly and add notes to profile
4. **Update profile**: Re-run `/track-source` with updated info

## Error Handling

### Invalid URL
- Note it in profile
- Mark as "URL needs verification"
- Suggest user visit manually

### Inactive Blog
- Mark status as "Inactive"
- Note last known active date if available
- Still useful for historical content

### Language Barrier
- Note the language
- Suggest translation tools if needed
- User can still track for reference

### Script Errors (YouTube)
- If youtube-channel-info.py fails, fall back to manual WebFetch
- Note what information couldn't be extracted
- Create profile with available information

## Remember

You're building a curated network of inspiration sources. Each profile should clearly answer:
- Why is this source valuable?
- What unique perspective do they offer?
- How does it connect to the user's work?

Quality profiles make scanning and analysis more effective.
