## Work Process

### 1. Claim Work

Before starting:
```bash
# Check what's available
.claude/state/work/check-overlap.sh

# Check specific work for overlap
.claude/state/work/check-overlap.sh phase-2-biomechanics

# If available, claim in your file
# Create: .claude/state/work/claimed/[your-agent-id].md
```

Document your claim:
```markdown
### Phase 2: Biomechanics - [Your Specific Scope]
- **Source**: available/phase-2-biomechanics.md
- **Claimed**: [timestamp]
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Scope**: [Exactly what you're doing - be specific]
  - INCLUDES: [What principles/categories]
  - EXCLUDES: [What's available for others]
- **Progress**: 0% - just claimed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Deliverables Completed**: None yet
```

### 2. Research Phase

**For each principle category** (structural, force, balance, efficiency, interaction):

1. **Find sources**:
   - Identify 2-3 key textbooks/resources for this category
   - Look for kinesiology, biomechanics, anatomy, sports science texts
   - Prioritize recent (2015+) and authoritative sources

2. **Study sources**:
   - Read relevant chapters/sections
   - Take notes on key concepts
   - Identify universal principles

3. **Extract principles**:
   - Identify 5-7 principles per category
   - Understand scientific basis (anatomy, physics, mechanics)
   - Note how principles apply to human movement

### 3. Documentation Phase

**For each principle**:

1. **Use template**: `templates/principle-template.md`
2. **Fill ALL sections**:
   - Definition (clear and precise)
   - Scientific Basis (anatomy + physics + kinesiology)
   - Manifestation in Aikido (how it applies - may need Aikido knowledge)
   - Teaching Approach (how to explain to students)
   - Relationships (to other principles)

3. **Cite sources properly**:
   - Include book title, author, chapter, page
   - Note what each source contributed
   - Minimum 2 sources per principle

4. **Save to correct location**:
   - `knowledge-base/principles/structural/[principle-name].md`
   - `knowledge-base/principles/force/[principle-name].md`
   - etc.

### 4. Bibliography Phase

**Create comprehensive source registry**:
- Location: `sources/books/biomechanics-sources.md`
- Include all sources used
- For each: title, author, why it's valuable, how to use it

### 5. Update Progress

**Regularly update your claimed file**:
```markdown
- **Progress**: 35% - documented 7 structural principles, researching force principles
- **Blockers**: [Any issues or "None"]
- **Deliverables Completed**:
  - 7 structural principles documented
  - Bibliography started
```

### 6. Validation

**Before marking complete**:
- Use `validation/principle-validation-checklist.md` for EACH principle
- Ensure minimum standards met
- Verify all cross-references work

### 7. Complete

When finished:
1. Create completion record in `.claude/state/work/completed/[your-work].md`
2. Update your claimed file (move to Completed section)
3. Update available work item status

## Tools You Use

### Essential
- **WebSearch**: Find textbooks, papers, courses
- **WebFetch**: Read online resources
- **Read**: Study existing materials, read templates
- **Write**: Create principle documentation
- **Edit**: Refine documentation

### Validation
- `validation/principle-validation-checklist.md` - Use for every principle

### Templates
- `templates/principle-template.md` - Use for every principle

## Example Workflow

**Scenario**: Documenting structural principles

1. **Research**:
   - Find: Neumann's Kinesiology textbook (chapters on alignment, posture)
   - Find: Knudson's Biomechanics (chapters on structural mechanics)
   - Study both sources on alignment and posture

2. **Extract Principle**: "Skeletal Alignment"
   - Definition: Optimal arrangement of bones to transfer force efficiently
   - Scientific basis: Load transfer through bones vs. muscles, joint stacking
   - Aikido application: Stance, posture during techniques
   - Teaching: "Stack your joints like building blocks"

3. **Document**:
   - Use `templates/principle-template.md`
   - Fill all sections with detail
   - Cite Neumann (Chapter X, page Y) and Knudson (Chapter Z, page W)
   - Save to `knowledge-base/principles/structural/skeletal-alignment.md`

4. **Validate**:
   - Check against `validation/principle-validation-checklist.md`
   - Ensure 2+ sources cited
   - Verify teaching approach included

5. **Continue**: Repeat for next principle

## Output Standards

### Principle Documentation
- **Completeness**: All template sections filled
- **Scientific rigor**: Proper sources, accurate explanations
- **Teachability**: Clear teaching approach, metaphors provided
- **Integration ready**: Can be referenced by technique documentation

### Bibliography
- **Comprehensive**: All sources documented
- **Organized**: By category or type
- **Usable**: Clear how to use each source

---

## Coordination

### With Other Agents

**Documentation Agents** (Phase 3):
- They will reference your principles when documenting techniques
- Ensure principles are clear and usable

**Pedagogical Agents** (Phase 4):
- They will reference principles when explaining errors
- Your principles explain WHY errors happen

**Integration Agents**:
- They will create principle-to-technique mappings
- Ensure your principle docs have consistent naming

### Work Splitting

Phase 2 can be split among multiple Research Agents:
- Agent A: Structural principles
- Agent B: Force principles
- Agent C: Balance + Efficiency principles
- Each claims specific scope in their file

**Coordinate**: Check claimed files before claiming to avoid overlap

---

## Success Criteria

You've succeeded when:
- ✅ 20+ principles documented (across all 5 categories)
- ✅ Each principle uses template format
- ✅ All principles validated with scientific sources
- ✅ Each has clear definition, scientific basis, teaching approach
- ✅ At least 2 sources per principle
- ✅ Bibliography complete
- ✅ Validation checklists passed

---

## Common Challenges

**Challenge**: Sources are dense scientific texts
**Solution**: Focus on key concepts, extract principles, don't document everything

**Challenge**: Connecting principles to Aikido when you may not practice
**Solution**: Document the universal principle scientifically. Let technique documentation agents make Aikido connections. You can note "applies to balance, body alignment, force transfer" generally.

**Challenge**: Finding good sources
**Solution**: Start with recommended sources in `sources/books/biomechanics-textbooks-registry.md`

**Challenge**: Too many principles possible
**Solution**: Focus on universal, fundamental principles. 20-30 total is sufficient for foundation.

---

## Remember

- **Your role**: External knowledge → systematic documentation
- **Your output**: Scientifically-grounded principles ready for teaching
- **Your standard**: MSc-level rigor (proper sources, accurate, complete)
- **Your coordination**: Claim work, update progress, communicate blockers

**Quality over speed**. This is foundation work - thoroughness matters more than completion time.
