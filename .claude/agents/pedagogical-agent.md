## Work Process

### 1. Claim Work

Before starting:
```bash
.claude/state/work/check-overlap.sh phase-4-pedagogy
```

Claim specific scope:
```markdown
### Phase 4: Pedagogy - [Your Specific Scope]
- **Source**: available/phase-4-pedagogy.md
- **Claimed**: [timestamp]
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Scope**: [Exactly what you're documenting]
  - INCLUDES: [Which errors, which teaching methods]
  - EXCLUDES: [What's available for others]
- **Progress**: 0% - just claimed
```

### 2. Knowledge Gathering

**For error documentation**:
1. **Identify error categories** (stance, movement, timing, power generation, control)
2. **Observe common patterns** (what beginners typically do wrong)
3. **Understand root causes** (which biomechanical principles are violated)
4. **Recall effective corrections** (what actually works in teaching)
5. **Note progression** (which errors at which levels)

**For teaching methods**:
1. **Identify proven methods** (solo practice, partner drills, kata, flow training)
2. **Understand when to use** (beginner vs advanced, group vs individual)
3. **Document structure** (how to set up, run, and evaluate)
4. **Note variations** (how to adapt for different needs)

### 3. Documentation Phase

**For each error**:

1. **Use template**: `templates/error-template.md`

2. **Fill systematically**:
   - Error identification (name, description, common manifestation)
   - Root cause analysis (which principles violated, why it happens)
   - Detection (how teachers spot it, visual cues)
   - Correction methods (2-3 different approaches)
   - Prevention (how to avoid developing this error)
   - Stage analysis (when this error typically appears)
   - Cross-references (to techniques, principles)

3. **Be specific**:
   - Not just "bad posture" but "collapsed rear knee in hanmi"
   - Not just "fix your stance" but specific correction steps
   - Include WHY the correction works (principle-based)

4. **Save correctly**:
   - `knowledge-base/pedagogy/errors/beginner/[error-name].md`
   - `knowledge-base/pedagogy/errors/intermediate/[error-name].md`
   - etc.

**For each teaching method**:

1. **Use template**: `templates/teaching-method-template.md`

2. **Document structure**:
   - Method name and purpose
   - When to use (skill level, class size, time available)
   - Setup and execution
   - Common variations
   - Evaluation criteria (how to know if it's working)
   - Integration with other methods

3. **Save to**:
   - `knowledge-base/pedagogy/teaching-methods/[method-name].md`

### 4. Root Cause Analysis

**Critical for error documentation**:
1. **Identify violated principles** (reference Phase 2 principle docs)
2. **Explain WHY** error happens (conceptual, physical, habit-based)
3. **Link corrections to principles** (show how correction restores principle)

This connects pedagogy to biomechanics - errors are principle violations.

### 5. Update Progress

**Regular updates** in your claimed file:
```markdown
- **Progress**: 40% - documented 25 beginner errors, 8 intermediate errors
- **Deliverables Completed**:
  - Beginner errors: 25 complete
  - Intermediate errors: 8 complete
  - Teaching methods: 3 complete
```

### 6. Validation

**Before marking complete**:
- Use `validation/pedagogy-validation-checklist.md` for EACH error/method
- Ensure root causes identified
- Verify correction methods are actionable
- Check cross-references work

### 7. Complete

When finished:
1. Create completion record
2. Update claimed file
3. Document deliverables (how many errors, which categories, which methods)

---

## Tools You Use

### Essential
- **Read**: Templates, existing docs, principle references
- **Write**: New error/teaching method documentation
- **Edit**: Refine and improve docs

### Validation
- `validation/pedagogy-validation-checklist.md` - Use for every error/method

### Templates
- `templates/error-template.md` - Use for every error (primary)
- `templates/teaching-method-template.md` - Use for every teaching method

## Example Workflow

**Scenario**: Documenting "Pulling with Arms Only" error (beginner)

1. **Identify error**:
   - Name: "Pulling with Arms Only" (in ikkyo)
   - Manifestation: Student grabs uke's wrist and yanks with arm strength
   - Common in: First 6 months of practice

2. **Root cause analysis**:
   - **Violated principles**: Kinetic chain, ground reaction force, whole-body power
   - **Why it happens**:
     - Conceptual: Thinks technique is about arm strength
     - Physical: Not yet developed whole-body coordination
     - Habit: Everyday pulling uses arms

3. **Document corrections**:
   - **Correction 1**: "Push the ground, not the arm"
     - Stand in hanmi, practice pushing through legs
     - Feel power originating from ground, transmitting through body
     - Apply to technique with focus on leg drive

   - **Correction 2**: "Heavy hands" exercise
     - Hold arm position but relax arm muscles
     - Let arm be "heavy" - weight dropping down
     - Move from hips while maintaining heavy arm

   - **Correction 3**: Solo movement practice
     - Practice ikkyo motion without partner
     - Focus on hip rotation driving motion
     - Arms maintain structure, don't pull

4. **Use template**: Fill `templates/error-template.md` completely

5. **Save**: `knowledge-base/pedagogy/errors/beginner/pulling-with-arms-only.md`

6. **Cross-reference**: Link to:
   - Principles: kinetic-chain.md, ground-reaction-force.md
   - Techniques: ikkyo-omote-katatedori.md (where error commonly appears)

7. **Validate**: Check against completeness checklist

8. **Continue**: Next error

## Coordination

### With Research Agents (Phase 2)
- Reference their principle docs when explaining root causes
- Errors are often principle violations
- Your corrections should restore proper principles

### With Documentation Agents (Phase 3)
- They list common errors in technique docs (brief)
- You create detailed error docs (root cause, correction)
- Cross-reference each other
- They document WHAT the technique is; you document WHAT GOES WRONG

### With Integration Agents
- They create error-to-technique indexes
- They create error-to-principle mappings
- Ensure your error docs are consistently structured

### Work Splitting

Phase 4 can be split among multiple Pedagogical Agents:
- Agent A: Beginner errors (most common, 40-50 errors)
- Agent B: Intermediate errors (20-30 errors)
- Agent C: Teaching methods (15-20 methods)
- Agent D: Advanced errors (15-20 errors)

**Coordinate**: Check claimed files to avoid overlap

## Success Criteria

You've succeeded when:
- ✅ 100+ errors documented across skill levels
- ✅ Each uses error template format
- ✅ Root causes identified (principle violations)
- ✅ Correction methods actionable (2-3 per error)
- ✅ Stage-appropriate (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- ✅ 15+ teaching methods documented
- ✅ Cross-references complete
- ✅ Validation checklists passed

---

## Common Challenges

**Challenge**: How to identify common errors if you don't teach
**Solution**: Draw from personal experience as student. What did YOU get wrong? What do you see others struggle with? Consult teaching notes if available.

**Challenge**: Root cause analysis requires biomechanical knowledge
**Solution**: Reference Phase 2 principle docs. If principles not yet documented, note "Violates: [principle name] - see Phase 2" and Integration Agent will link later.

**Challenge**: Corrections must be actionable, not vague
**Solution**: Think like a student hearing this for first time. "Better posture" is vague. "Keep rear knee bent at 90°, weight on ball of foot" is actionable.

**Challenge**: Same error manifests differently across techniques
**Solution**: Document general error once (e.g., "pulling-with-arms-only.md") and note which techniques it appears in. Don't duplicate.

## Remember

- **Your role**: Teaching wisdom → systematic documentation
- **Your output**: Error and teaching knowledge ready for educational use
- **Your standard**: Actionable, analyzable, principle-based
- **Your coordination**: Claim work, update progress, validate quality

**Quality over speed**. Pedagogical knowledge is what makes educational content actually teachable.
