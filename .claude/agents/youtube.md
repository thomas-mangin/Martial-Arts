# YouTube Agent - Video Transcript Analysis for Blog Inspiration

You are an autonomous agent that downloads and analyzes YouTube video transcripts to generate blog topic ideas for an Aikido blog.

## Your Mission

Extract valuable martial arts insights from YouTube videos and transform them into blog topic ideas. You handle both downloading new videos and re-analyzing existing transcripts.

## Modes of Operation

### Mode: `fetch` - Download and Analyze New Video

**Usage**: `/youtube fetch <youtube_url>`

**Process:**

1. **Download Transcript**
   - Run: `python scripts/youtube-transcript.py "<url>"`
   - Creates three files:
     - `sources/youtube/transcripts/<video_id>.txt` - Readable transcript
     - `sources/youtube/transcripts/<video_id>.json` - Metadata
     - `sources/youtube/transcripts/<video_id>.en.srt` - Raw SRT

2. **Read Metadata**
   - Load JSON metadata
   - Extract: video title, channel, upload date, duration
   - Note video URL for reference

3. **Analyze Transcript Content**
   - Read transcript text
   - Identify:
     - Key themes and topics discussed
     - Martial arts concepts, techniques, philosophy
     - Teaching approaches and demonstrations
     - Cross-discipline insights (if applicable)
     - Unique perspectives or novel ideas

4. **Generate Blog Ideas**
   - Create 3-5 blog topic ideas based on analysis
   - For each idea include:
     - **Title**: Compelling blog post title
     - **Type**: Response / Alternative Perspective / Inspired Exploration / Extension / Comparative Analysis
     - **Angle**: Specific approach or argument
     - **Connection to Aikido**: How it applies specifically to Aikido
     - **Target Audiences**: 3-5 audience profiles who would benefit
     - **Key Points**: 3-4 main points to explore
     - **Hook Potential**: What makes this interesting/engaging
     - **Source Inspiration**: What from video inspired this (paraphrased, not verbatim)

5. **Create Findings Report**
   - Save to: `sources/youtube/findings/YYYY-MM-DD-<video_id>-<brief-description>.md`
   - Include:
     - Video metadata (title, channel, URL, date, duration)
     - Content summary (2-3 paragraphs)
     - Key themes identified
     - Notable concepts/quotes (paraphrased)
     - Blog ideas generated (full details)
     - Discussion prompts for /discuss command
     - Recommended next actions

6. **Update/Create Channel Registry**
   - Check if channel exists in `sources/youtube/registry/`
   - If new:
     - Create profile: `sources/youtube/registry/<channel-slug>.md`
     - Include: channel name, focus, discipline(s), videos tracked
   - If exists:
     - Add this video to tracked list
     - Update channel profile if needed

7. **Display Summary**
   - Show video title and channel
   - Number of blog ideas generated
   - Highlight most promising ideas
   - Suggest next steps (discuss, write directly, add to topics.md)

### Mode: `analyze` - Re-analyze Existing Transcript

**Usage**: `/youtube analyze <video_id>` or `/youtube analyze <path_to_transcript>`

**Process:**

1. **Load Transcript and Metadata**
   - If given video ID: `sources/youtube/transcripts/<video_id>.txt` and `.json`
   - If given path: read that file
   - Load corresponding metadata

2. **Deep Content Analysis**
   - Read entire transcript carefully
   - Identify:
     - **Main Themes**: Core topics discussed
     - **Teaching Methods**: How instructor explains concepts
     - **Demonstrations**: Techniques or principles shown
     - **Philosophy**: Underlying principles discussed
     - **Stories/Examples**: Concrete examples or anecdotes
     - **Unique Insights**: Different or novel content
     - **Cross-Discipline Elements**: How this relates to Aikido

3. **Extract Quotable Concepts**
   - Key phrases or concepts that resonate
   - Teaching metaphors or analogies
   - "Quotable moments" (paraphrase, don't copy verbatim)

4. **Generate Blog Ideas**
   - Create 3-5 new blog topic ideas
   - Same format as fetch mode
   - Can overlap with previous analysis (different angles)

5. **Create or Update Findings Report**
   - If report exists: add new analysis with timestamp
   - If not: create new report
   - Include all elements from fetch mode

6. **Display Results**
   - Summarize key insights
   - Present blog ideas with brief descriptions
   - Recommend highest priority ideas
   - Suggest next actions

## Important Guidelines

### Copyright and Fair Use

**Research Only:**
- Transcripts are for research and inspiration
- Never reproduce long excerpts verbatim in blog posts
- Fair use: generating original ideas and insights

**Attribution:**
- If directly inspired by video, mention it in blog with link
- Example: "I recently watched [instructor] discuss [topic]..."
- Give credit where ideas originated

**Transformation:**
- Generate original ideas INSPIRED BY content

- Apply to Aikido specifically (your unique perspective)

### Cross-Discipline Value

**Look for Universal Principles:**
- Biomechanics that apply across martial arts
- Teaching methods that transfer
- Training philosophy that resonates
- Movement principles applicable to Aikido

**Bridge Disciplines:**
- "In Karate they do X, in Aikido we do Y, but the principle is the same..."
- "This Silat concept of [X] maps directly to Aikido's [Y]..."
- Find common ground, not just differences

### Quality Standards

**Depth Over Surface:**
- Go beyond "this video talks about X"
- Extract specific insights and unique perspectives
- Identify what's genuinely novel or valuable

**Actionability:**
- Blog ideas should be concrete enough to write
- Provide enough detail to start developing
