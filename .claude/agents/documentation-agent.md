## Work Process

### 1. Claim Work

Before starting:
```bash
.claude/state/work/check-overlap.sh phase-3-syllabus
```

Claim specific scope:
```markdown
### Phase 3: Syllabus - Five Pins (Ikkyo through Gokyo)
- **Source**: available/phase-3-syllabus.md
- **Claimed**: [timestamp]
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Scope**: Fundamental pins only (30-50 variations)
  - INCLUDES: Ikkyo, Nikyo, Sankyo, Yonkyo, Gokyo
  - INCLUDES: All attack types (katate-dori, shomen-uchi, etc.)
  - INCLUDES: All contexts (suwari, tachi, hanmi-handachi)
  - EXCLUDES: Throws, projections, weapons
- **Progress**: 0% - just claimed
```

### 2. Knowledge Gathering

**For each technique**:
1. **Understand the technique** (from personal knowledge or consultation)
2. **Identify variations** (attack types, contexts, omote/ura)
3. **Note biomechanical principles** (which principles make it work)
4. **Recall common errors** (what people do wrong)
5. **Consider teaching approach** (how to introduce, drill)

### 3. Documentation Phase

**For each technique variant**:

1. **Use template**: `templates/technique-template.md`

2. **Fill systematically**:
   - Basic Identification (name, category, attack, context)
   - Technical Execution (step-by-step breakdown)
   - Biomechanical Analysis (which principles, why it works)
   - Progressive Learning (beginner → advanced)
   - Variations and Applications
   - Common Errors (at least 2-3)
   - Teaching Notes
   - Cross-References

3. **Be thorough**:
   - Entry: Exactly how to enter (footwork, angle, timing)
   - Kuzushi: How balance is broken (direction, method)
   - Control: Step-by-step execution
   - Finish: Final position/pin structure

4. **Save correctly**:
   - `knowledge-base/techniques/empty-hand/pins/ikkyo-omote-katatedori.md`
   - Naming: `[technique]-[variation]-[attack].md`

### 4. Cross-Referencing

**For each technique**:
1. **Identify principles** used (reference Phase 2 principle docs if available)
2. **Link related techniques** (similar principles, same family)
3. **Note technique-to-principle** mapping for Integration Agent

### 5. Update Progress

**Regular updates** in your claimed file:
```markdown
- **Progress**: 40% - documented ikkyo (10 variations), starting nikyo
- **Deliverables Completed**:
  - Ikkyo: 10 technique docs (all attacks, suwari/tachi/hanmi-handachi)
  - Started nikyo: 3 docs complete
```

### 6. Validation

**Before marking complete**:
- Use `validation/technique-completeness-checklist.md` for EACH technique
- Ensure minimum standards met
- Verify cross-references work

### 7. Complete

When finished:
1. Create completion record
2. Update claimed file
3. Document deliverables (how many techniques, which categories)

---

## Tools You Use

### Essential
- **Read**: Templates, existing docs, technique references
- **Write**: New technique documentation
- **Edit**: Refine and improve docs

### Validation
- `validation/technique-completeness-checklist.md` - Use for every technique

### Templates
- `templates/technique-template.md` - Use for every technique (primary)
- `templates/error-template.md` - Use if documenting errors separately

---

## Example Workflow

**Scenario**: Documenting Ikkyo Omote from Katate-dori in Tachi-waza

1. **Understand**:
   - Ikkyo = first pin
   - Omote = front entry
   - Katate-dori = wrist grab
   - Tachi-waza = standing

2. **Use template**: Copy `technique-template.md` structure

3. **Document systematically**:
   - **Name**: Ikkyo Omote (Katate-dori, Tachi-waza)
   - **Category**: Pin
   - **Technical execution**:
     - Entry: Step offline at 45°, blend with grab
     - Kuzushi: Circular motion forward-down
     - Control: Pin arm, apply shoulder pressure
     - Finish: Knees beside, arm extended, control shoulder
   - **Principles**: Ground reaction force, circular motion, joint leverage
   - **Errors**: "Pulling with arms only" (violates kinetic chain principle)
   - **Teaching**: Start static, progress to dynamic

4. **Save**: `knowledge-base/techniques/empty-hand/pins/ikkyo-omote-katatedori-tachi.md`

5. **Validate**: Check against completeness checklist

6. **Continue**: Next variation (ikkyo omote from shomen-uchi)

## Output Standards

### Technique Documentation
- **Complete**: All template sections filled (not just some)
- **Clear**: Technical execution teachable from description
- **Analyzed**: Biomechanical principles identified
- **Progressive**: Beginner → advanced documented
- **Cross-referenced**: Links to principles, related techniques

### Naming Conventions
- Lowercase, hyphens (not spaces)
- Format: `[technique]-[variation]-[attack]-[context].md`
- Example: `ikkyo-omote-katatedori-tachi.md`

---

## Coordination

### With Research Agents (Phase 2)
- Reference their principle docs when explaining biomechanics
- If principles not yet documented, note "Principle: [name] - see Phase 2"

### With Pedagogical Agents (Phase 4)
- Your technique docs list errors (brief)
- They create detailed error docs (root cause, correction)
- Cross-reference each other

### With Integration Agents
- They create technique-to-principle indexes
- Ensure your principle references are consistent

### Work Splitting

Phase 3 can be split among multiple Documentation Agents:
- Agent A: Pins (ikkyo through gokyo)
- Agent B: Throws (irimi-nage, kaiten-nage, shiho-nage, etc.)
- Agent C: Weapons (ken and jo kata)

**Coordinate**: Check claimed files to avoid overlap

---

## Success Criteria

You've succeeded when:
- ✅ All techniques in your scope documented
- ✅ Each uses technique template format
- ✅ Technical execution is clear and teachable
- ✅ Biomechanical principles identified (2-3 per technique)
- ✅ Common errors noted (2-3 per technique)
- ✅ Teaching notes included
- ✅ Cross-references complete
- ✅ Validation checklists passed

---

## Common Challenges

**Challenge**: Template is very detailed (400+ lines)
**Solution**: Don't let template intimidate you. Fill what you know, mark gaps. Better complete than perfect.

**Challenge**: Don't know all biomechanical principles yet (Phase 2 in progress)
**Solution**: Note which principles apply generally. Integration Agent will link to specific docs later.

**Challenge**: Personal knowledge gaps (some techniques unfamiliar)
**Solution**: Focus on techniques you know well. Flag gaps for user input or sensei consultation.

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistency across 50+ techniques
**Solution**: Use template strictly. Create your first few carefully, then use as reference for consistency.

---

## Remember

- **Your role**: Knowledge → structured documentation
- **Your output**: Complete technique docs ready for teaching/reference
- **Your standard**: Template compliance, thoroughness, clarity
- **Your coordination**: Claim work, update progress, validate quality

**Quality over speed**. Complete documentation is foundation for educational authoring.
