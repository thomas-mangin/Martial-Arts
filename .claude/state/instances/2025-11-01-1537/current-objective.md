## Current Task

**IN PROGRESS**: Identifying good material to learn from - source discovery and content curation for educational article series.

---

## Progress

### Domain 1: Biomechanics/Anatomy/Kinesiology (Initial exploration only)
- [x] Preliminary web search of kinesiology textbooks
- [x] Preliminary web search of anatomy resources
- [x] Preliminary web search of structural biomechanics
- [x] Compiled initial registry (not evaluated/accessed)

**Output**: `sources/books/biomechanics-textbooks-registry.md` (preliminary list from web searches)

**Status**: Surface-level research only - resources not yet acquired, evaluated, or studied

### Other Domains to Explore (Not started)
- [ ] Motor learning and skill acquisition
- [ ] Pedagogical theory and teaching methodology
- [ ] Sports psychology and mental training
- [ ] Training program design and periodization
- [ ] Evidence-based martial arts training research
- [ ] Academic martial arts studies (history, philosophy, cross-cultural)
- [ ] Movement quality assessment and correction
- [ ] Injury prevention and rehabilitation science
- [ ] Performance analysis and measurement
- [ ] And more...

## Work Done So Far

Created preliminary biomechanics textbooks list from web searches, including:

**Kinesiology & Human Movement**:
- Neumann's Kinesiology (⭐ Gold standard, 2025 award winner)
- Knudson's Fundamentals of Biomechanics
- Clinical Kinesiology (problem-based learning)
- Dr. Oatis comprehensive reference

**Functional Anatomy**:
- Trail Guide to the Body (⭐ 900k+ copies, most accessible)
- Functional Anatomy for Manual Therapists
- Anatomy Trains (⭐ Myofascial meridians, kinetic chains)

**Structural Biomechanics**:
- Emeric Arus (⭐ Martial arts specific!)
- Barry Broughton (Comprehensive Anatomy for Martial Arts)
- Biomechanics of Human Movement (free OER)

**Online Resources**:
- Muscle and Motion (⭐ 3D animations)
- NASM/Coursera courses
- NESTA certification
- Free foundation courses

**Key Concepts Documented**:
- Lever systems and mechanical advantage
- Force vectors and torque analysis
- Center of mass and stability
- Kinetic chain and sequential movement
- Ground reaction force (with 2024-2025 research)
- Tensegrity and biotensegrity
- Myofascial meridians and force transfer
- Static vs. dynamic equilibrium

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Citation hierarchy for maximum authority
- When to use which resource
- Integration with existing martial arts books
- Priority study plan (4 levels)

## Next Steps

**Immediate** - Continue domain exploration:
1. Motor learning and skill acquisition resources
2. Pedagogical theory resources
3. Sports psychology resources
4. Training methodology resources
5. Research academic sources (not just commercial textbooks)

**Then** - Actual evaluation:
1. Access and review promising resources (library, preview, purchase)
2. Evaluate quality, alignment, and applicability
3. Prioritize based on actual content, not web descriptions
4. Create study plan based on real assessment

**Reality Check**:
- Web searches ≠ identifying good material
- List compilation ≠ source evaluation
- This is exploratory phase, not completion phase

## Notes

**Reality**:
- Only scratched surface of ONE domain (biomechanics)
- Did quick web searches, compiled what others say about books
- Haven't accessed, read, or evaluated any of these resources
- Many more domains to explore
- This is beginning of exploration, not completion

**Learning**:
- Premature completion declaration
- Need deeper, more thorough approach
- MSc-level standards require actual evaluation, not list-making
- "Identifying good material" means much more than web searches
