## Current Task

**IN PROGRESS**: Identifying good material to learn from - source discovery and content curation for educational article series.

---

## Progress

### Domain 1: Biomechanics/Anatomy/Kinesiology (Initial exploration only)
- [x] Preliminary web search of kinesiology textbooks
- [x] Preliminary web search of anatomy resources
- [x] Preliminary web search of structural biomechanics
- [x] Compiled initial registry (not evaluated/accessed)

**Output**: `sources/books/biomechanics-textbooks-registry.md` (preliminary list from web searches)

**Status**: Surface-level research only - resources not yet acquired, evaluated, or studied

### Other Domains to Explore (Not started)
- [ ] Motor learning and skill acquisition
- [ ] Pedagogical theory and teaching methodology
- [ ] Sports psychology and mental training
- [ ] Training program design and periodization
- [ ] Evidence-based martial arts training research
- [ ] Academic martial arts studies (history, philosophy, cross-cultural)
- [ ] Movement quality assessment and correction
- [ ] Injury prevention and rehabilitation science
- [ ] Performance analysis and measurement
- [ ] And more...

## Work Done So Far

Created preliminary biomechanics textbooks list from web searches, including:

**Kinesiology & Human Movement**:
- Neumann's Kinesiology (⭐ Gold standard, 2025 award winner)
- Knudson's Fundamentals of Biomechanics
- Clinical Kinesiology (problem-based learning)
- Dr. Oatis comprehensive reference

**Functional Anatomy**:
- Trail Guide to the Body (⭐ 900k+ copies, most accessible)
- Functional Anatomy for Manual Therapists
- Anatomy Trains (⭐ Myofascial meridians, kinetic chains)

**Structural Biomechanics**:
- Emeric Arus (⭐ Martial arts specific!)
- Barry Broughton (Comprehensive Anatomy for Martial Arts)
- Biomechanics of Human Movement (free OER)

**Online Resources**:
- Muscle and Motion (⭐ 3D animations)
- NASM/Coursera courses
- NESTA certification
- Free foundation courses

**Key Concepts Documented**:
- Lever systems and mechanical advantage
- Force vectors and torque analysis
- Center of mass and stability
- Kinetic chain and sequential movement
- Ground reaction force (with 2024-2025 research)
- Tensegrity and biotensegrity
- Myofascial meridians and force transfer
- Static vs. dynamic equilibrium

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Citation hierarchy for maximum authority
- When to use which resource
- Integration with existing martial arts books
- Priority study plan (4 levels)

## Next Steps - Approved Strategy

**User Guidance Received** (2025-11-01 16:10):
- ✅ Approve parallel agent approach
- **Divide and conquer** - Split domains across agents
- **Layered/breadth-first** - Get rounded view before going deep in any topic
- **Phased approach**: Learning → Analysis → Authoring (user signals transitions)
- **Ignore timeline** - Not time-constrained

**Immediate Action** - Launch 4 Parallel Learning Agents:
1. Agent 1: Motor Learning & Skill Acquisition
2. Agent 2: Teaching Methodology & Instructional Design
3. Agent 3: Sports Psychology for Martial Arts
4. Agent 4: Injury Prevention Science

**Each Agent Scope** (Layer 1 - Breadth):
- Identify 3-5 core concepts
- Find 2-3 essential resources (textbooks, courses, research)
- Extract key principles applicable to Aikido teaching
- Document WHY concepts matter
- Output: Concepts + Resources + Application notes

**After Layer 1** - Integration & Validation:
- Review all 4 outputs
- Create integration document (overlaps, connections)
- Present to user for validation
- User decides: Next layer of depth OR switch domains OR proceed to analysis phase

**WHY Layered Approach**:
- Prevents going too deep in one area before understanding others
- Reveals connections between domains early
- Allows strategic prioritization after seeing landscape
- Can course-correct before heavy investment

## Notes

**Reality**:
- Only scratched surface of ONE domain (biomechanics)
- Did quick web searches, compiled what others say about books
- Haven't accessed, read, or evaluated any of these resources
- Many more domains to explore
- This is beginning of exploration, not completion

**Learning from Session**:
1. Premature completion declaration - Need deeper, more thorough approach
2. MSc-level standards require actual evaluation, not list-making
3. "Identifying good material" means much more than web searches
4. **WHY-first thinking is essential** - Conclusions without reasoning are shallow
5. **Recording thinking in files** - Not just outputs, but rationale for resumption

**System Updates Made**:

**Round 1 - WHY-First Thinking**:
- Created `.claude/docs/design-principles.md` (WHY-first thinking framework)
- Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (added WHY-first core principle)
- Updated `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` (added WHY-first requirement)
- Updated `research/knowledge-domains-for-teaching.md` (added Design Decisions & Reasoning Log)

**WHY**: User feedback - "your thinking is very good but your recording of your thinking is not as deep"
- Future Claude instances need reasoning, not just conclusions
- Enables course correction if assumptions change
- Creates institutional memory in files

**Round 2 - Collaboration Model**:
- Created `.claude/docs/collaboration-model.md` (professor-student relationship model)
- Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (added collaboration model summary)

**WHY**: User request - "design a system where you use me to focus your progress"
- User role: Professor/mentor (sets direction, validates thinking)
- Claude role: Advanced student/expert changing domains (high capability, low domain experience)
- Traditional hierarchy doesn't fit: I'm subordinate but more capable
- Optimal: User focuses progress, Claude executes deeply with validation
- Pattern: Propose approach → validate → execute → present results → validate
- Documented for future Claude instances to understand relationship
