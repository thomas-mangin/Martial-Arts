# Current Objective

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-01 17:15
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

## Agreed Objective

**OBJECTIVE (2025-11-01 16:20 - COMPLETE ✅)**: Build distributed work coordination system AND agent specifications for safe parallel agent execution.

**WHY**: User wants to run Phases 2-5 in parallel using agents. Current system has no parallelism coordination - would cause conflicts and duplicate work. Need infrastructure before launching agents.

**ROLE**: This instance focuses on SYSTEM BUILDING. Other agents will do actual research/documentation work.

**COMPLETION**: All system components built and verified. Ready for agent launches.

**Previous objective** (COMPLETE): Transition from blog-writing to educational authoring infrastructure - Phase 1 architecture design finished.

---

## Key Realizations

### Current System is Blog-Oriented, Not Book-Oriented
- Current "article ideas" are shallow, single-point, catchy (blog-style)
- We need comprehensive, deep, rigorous educational content (book/textbook-style)
- 1,500-3,000 words per article is still blog-thinking - real educational chapters are longer and more thorough

### Critical Gaps in Knowledge Base

**1. Iwama Syllabus Not Fully Defined**
- Need complete technical documentation of ALL techniques
- Not just names - full biomechanical breakdowns
- Progressive learning structure
- What makes each technique work (principles in action)

**2. Biomechanical Principles Incomplete**
- Current principles are a starting point, not exhaustive
- Need to be more rigorous and comprehensive
- May need to research architecture and medicine for:
  - How the body actually works
  - How structural integrity is created
  - Universal principles of body mechanics

**3. Common Pitfalls Not Documented**
- Need to identify what practitioners (especially beginners) get wrong
- Not just identify problems - provide solutions and guidance
- This requires systematic observation and teaching experience capture

**4. YouTube Transcripts Missing Visual Context**
- Transcripts capture words but miss the demonstrations
- Missing: body positions, movement demonstrations, visual corrections
- Instructors reference "watch this" but we only have words
- May not be sufficient as primary research source

### Fundamental Problem: We Don't Have the Solution Yet

**Information Architecture Not Fit for Purpose:**
- How do we properly collect comprehensive technical knowledge?
- How do we organize it for educational progression?
- How do we validate it's correct and complete?
- How do we connect principles → techniques → teaching → common errors?

**We need to solve the "HOW" before we can do the "WHAT"**

---

## Required Capabilities (Not Yet Built)

1. **Comprehensive Syllabus Documentation System**
   - Structure for capturing complete technique breakdowns
   - Progressive learning pathways
   - Principle-to-technique mapping

2. **Rigorous Biomechanical Knowledge Base**
   - May require external research (anatomy, kinesiology, structural engineering)
   - Exhaustive principle documentation
   - Scientific validation where possible

3. **Pedagogical Intelligence**
   - Common errors and corrections database
   - Stage-appropriate teaching guidance
   - Learning progression models

4. **Multi-Modal Research Capture**
   - YouTube transcripts alone insufficient (missing visual)
   - Need way to reference video timestamps for demonstrations
   - May need personal practice/teaching notes capture
   - External academic sources (anatomy, biomechanics)

5. **Quality Validation System**
   - How do we know our knowledge base is complete?
   - How do we validate technical accuracy?
   - How do we ensure educational effectiveness?

## Approach & Reasoning

**This is a Long-Term Foundation Building Project**

Not a "start writing articles" project. This may take months or years of research, organization, and validation before serious authoring begins.

**Expected Pattern:**
1. Plan → Execute → Review → Discover gaps → Extend plan → Repeat
2. Multiple iterations of research and organization
3. Continuous refinement of information architecture
4. Building comprehensive knowledge base BEFORE writing

**Why This Matters:**
- Serious educational authoring requires comprehensive, validated knowledge
- Blog-style "cover one point" is insufficient for teaching
- Need textbook-level depth and rigor
- Foundation must be solid before building on it

## Work Coordination + Agent System - COMPLETE ✅

## Context References

**Current State:**
- `session-context.md` - Written with blog/article writing assumption
- `topics.md` - Contains blog-era ideas (shallow, single-point)
- `research/` - Starting point but incomplete
- `sources/youtube/` - 1,983 transcripts but missing visual context
- `article/` - Guidelines for blog-style articles, not educational chapters

**Needs Fundamental Rethinking:**
- Information architecture
- Research methodology
- Knowledge organization
- Authoring approach

---

## Notes

This is a pivotal moment. The user has correctly identified that rushing to write would produce blog-quality content, not educational-quality content. The infrastructure needs to support serious research and knowledge building first.

The current system is not broken - it's just solving the wrong problem. We need to redesign for the right problem: building a comprehensive knowledge foundation for serious educational authoring.
