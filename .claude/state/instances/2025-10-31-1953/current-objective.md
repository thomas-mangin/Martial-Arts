# Current Objective

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31 21:14

## Agreed Objective

Phase 3: Review Session Management Commands to ensure command implementation files match updated documentation and multi-instance architecture.

---

## Key Requirements

### Scope of Review
Review consistency between command implementation files and updated documentation:

**Command Files**:
1. `.claude/commands/resume.md` - Session start, instance detection
2. `.claude/commands/checkpoint.md` - Session end, commit, push
3. `.claude/commands/save-objective.md` - Explicit state save
4. `.claude/commands/pause-task.md` - Move work to backlog

**Cross-reference with**:
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` (updated in Phase 1)
- `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md` (rewrote in Phase 2)
- `decisions.md` (Session Management section)

### What to Verify
- **Multi-instance support**: Commands implement instance detection and management
- **File paths**: Reference instance-specific paths where appropriate
- **Workflow alignment**: Match workflow-protocol.md instructions
- **Documentation consistency**: Match commands-reference.md descriptions
- **Behavior requirements**: Implement decisions.md session management decisions
- **Completeness**: All multi-instance features present
- **Terminology**: Use correct article series terminology

### Success Criteria
- Identify inconsistencies between command files and updated docs
- Find outdated instructions or missing multi-instance features
- Verify commands implement workflow-protocol.md correctly
- Apply fixes to align command files with Phase 1 & 2 updates
- Phase 3 marked complete in backlog

---

## Approach & Reasoning

**Review Strategy:**
1. Read all 4 command files (resume, checkpoint, save-objective, pause-task)
2. Cross-reference with workflow-protocol.md (Phase 1 updates)
3. Cross-reference with commands-reference.md (Phase 2 rewrites)
4. Cross-reference with decisions.md Session Management
5. Identify outdated instructions or missing multi-instance features
6. Present findings with specific examples
7. Apply fixes to command files
8. Update backlog

**Why this order:**
- Command files are actual implementation instructions
- workflow-protocol.md defines expected behavior (updated Phase 1)
- commands-reference.md documents what commands should do (rewritten Phase 2)
- decisions.md explains why (rationale)
- Cross-reference catches drift from Phase 1 & 2 updates
- Fix command files to match updated documentation

## Progress

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Workflow Protocol System Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 2: Architecture & Command System Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Todo list created for Phase 3
- ✅ Objective updated for Phase 3
- ✅ Read all 4 command files (resume, checkpoint, save-objective, pause-task)
- ✅ Cross-referenced with updated docs
- ✅ Identified 3 minor issues (terminology inconsistencies)
- ✅ Presented findings to user
- ✅ Applied fixes: checkpoint.md, CLAUDE.md, save-objective.md
- ✅ Updated backlog.md with Phase 3 completion
- ✅ Phase 3: Session Management Commands Review - COMPLETE

**In Progress:**
- None

**Remaining:**
- Phases 4-8 of system documentation review (if desired)

## Blockers / Questions

None currently.

## Context References

**Files Under Review:**
- `.claude/commands/resume.md`
- `.claude/commands/checkpoint.md`
- `.claude/commands/save-objective.md`
- `.claude/commands/pause-task.md`

**Cross-reference with:**
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md`
- `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md`
- `decisions.md` (Session Management section)

**Part Of:**
- Comprehensive System Documentation Review (from backlog)
- Phase 3 of 8 phases

---

## Notes

Phase 3 focuses on session management command implementation files. These are the actual instructions Claude follows when executing /resume, /checkpoint, /save-objective, and /pause-task. Need to ensure they align with the workflow protocol and documentation updated in Phases 1 & 2.
