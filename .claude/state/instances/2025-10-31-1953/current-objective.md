## Agreed Objective

Phase 2: Review Architecture & Command System to ensure system design documentation matches implementation and user intentions.

---

## Key Requirements

### Scope of Review
Review consistency and accuracy across four key files:
1. `.claude/docs/architecture.md` - Overall system design and organization
2. `.claude/docs/workflows.md` - How different workflows fit together
3. `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md` - Command organization and documentation
4. `decisions.md` - System Architecture section

### What to Verify
- **System design**: Architecture accurately reflects current implementation
- **Directory structure**: Documented structure matches actual organization
- **Workflow descriptions**: All workflows accurately documented
- **Command organization**: Commands properly categorized and documented
- **Consistency**: All four files align with each other
- **Completeness**: Nothing missing, outdated, or contradictory
- **User alignment**: Matches actual system and user intentions

### Success Criteria
- Identify any inconsistencies between the four files
- Find gaps, outdated information, or missing guidance
- Verify documentation matches actual implementation
- Recommend fixes if needed
- Apply fixes with user confirmation
- Phase 2 marked complete in backlog

---

## Approach & Reasoning

**Review Strategy:**
1. Read architecture.md in full (system design)
2. Read workflows.md (workflow descriptions)
3. Read commands-reference.md (command organization)
4. Read decisions.md System Architecture section (rationale)
5. Cross-reference for consistency
6. Identify issues, gaps, or misalignments
7. Present findings with specific examples
8. Apply fixes (similar to Phase 1)
9. Update backlog

**Why this order:**
- architecture.md is most comprehensive - sets baseline
- workflows.md should align with architecture
- commands-reference.md should reflect command organization
- decisions.md explains architectural choices
- Cross-reference catches inconsistencies
- Apply fixes to align documentation with implementation

## Progress

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Workflow Protocol System Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Todo list created for Phase 2
- ✅ Objective updated for Phase 2
- ✅ Read all four architecture files (architecture.md, workflows.md, commands-reference.md, decisions.md)
- ✅ Analyzed consistency across all files
- ✅ Identified 7 critical issues (blog terminology, directory structure, missing commands, quality mismatches)
- ✅ Presented findings to user
- ✅ User confirmed Option A (complete rewrite)
- ✅ Rewrote architecture.md for article series + multi-instance (313 lines)
- ✅ Rewrote workflows.md for article series approach (522 lines)
- ✅ Rewrote commands-reference.md with all commands (720 lines)
- ✅ Updated backlog.md with Phase 2 completion
- ✅ Phase 2: Architecture & Command System Review - COMPLETE

**In Progress:**
- None

**Remaining:**
- Phases 3-8 of system documentation review (if desired)

## Blockers / Questions

None currently.

---

## Context References

**Files Under Review:**
- `.claude/docs/architecture.md`
- `.claude/docs/workflows.md`
- `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md`
- `decisions.md` (System Architecture section)

**Part Of:**
- Comprehensive System Documentation Review (from backlog)
- Phase 2 of 8 phases

---

## Notes

Phase 2 focuses on system architecture and command organization. This ensures the documented system design matches the actual implementation and that commands are properly organized and documented.
