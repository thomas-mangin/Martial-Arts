## Agreed Objective

Phase 4: Review Content Creation Commands to ensure agent command files match updated documentation and use correct article series terminology.

---

## Key Requirements

### Scope of Review
Review consistency between agent command implementation files and updated documentation:

**Command Files**:
1. `.claude/commands/discuss.md` - Topic exploration agent
2. `.claude/commands/extract.md` - Discussion to article draft agent
3. `.claude/commands/review-aikido.md` - Article quality review agent

**Cross-reference with**:
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` (updated in Phase 1)
- `.claude/docs/workflows.md` (rewrote in Phase 2)
- `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md` (rewrote in Phase 2)
- `decisions.md` (Content Creation section)

### What to Verify
- **Terminology**: Use "article" not "blog" throughout
- **Quality standards**: Reference 1,500-3,000+ word educational targets (not blog-style 800-1,200)
- **Directory paths**: Reference `articles/` and `discussions/` (not blog/, posts/)
- **Workflow alignment**: Match workflow-protocol.md and workflows.md
- **Agent behavior**: Implement decisions.md content creation decisions
- **Multi-instance aware**: Work correctly with instance-specific state
- **Educational focus**: MSc-level depth, not engagement metrics

### Success Criteria
- Identify inconsistencies between command files and updated docs
- Find outdated instructions or blog terminology
- Verify agents implement educational article standards correctly
- Apply fixes to align command files with Phase 1-3 updates
- Phase 4 marked complete in backlog

## Approach & Reasoning

**Review Strategy:**
1. Read all 3 agent command files (discuss, extract, review-aikido)
2. Cross-reference with workflows.md (Phase 2 rewrites for article standards)
3. Cross-reference with commands-reference.md (Phase 2 agent documentation)
4. Cross-reference with decisions.md Content Creation section
5. Identify outdated instructions or blog terminology
6. Present findings with specific examples
7. Apply fixes to command files
8. Update backlog

**Why this order:**
- These are agent prompt files that guide content creation behavior
- workflows.md defines article quality standards (updated Phase 2)
- commands-reference.md documents what agents should do (rewritten Phase 2)
- decisions.md explains content creation rationale
- These agents directly impact article writing quality
- Must use educational standards, not blog engagement focus

## Progress

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Workflow Protocol System Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 2: Architecture & Command System Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 3: Session Management Commands Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Phase 4: Content Creation Commands Review - COMPLETE
- ✅ Objective updated for Phase 4
- ✅ Read all 3 agent command files
- ✅ Cross-referenced with updated docs
- ✅ Identified 4 minor issues (terminology and missing info)
- ✅ Applied fixes: extract.md, review-aikido.md, decisions.md
- ✅ Updated backlog.md with Phase 4 completion

**In Progress:**
- None

**Remaining:**
- Phases 5-8 of system documentation review (if desired)

## Blockers / Questions

None currently.

## Context References

**Files Under Review:**
- `.claude/commands/discuss.md`
- `.claude/commands/extract.md`
- `.claude/commands/review-aikido.md`

**Cross-reference with:**
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md`
- `.claude/docs/workflows.md`
- `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md`
- `decisions.md` (Content Creation section)

**Part Of:**
- Comprehensive System Documentation Review (from backlog)
- Phase 4 of 8 phases

---

## Notes

Phase 4 focuses on content creation agent command files. These are agent prompts that guide /discuss, /extract, and /review-aikido behavior. Need to ensure they use article series terminology and educational quality standards updated in Phases 1-3.
