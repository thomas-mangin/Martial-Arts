## Agreed Objective

Phase 8: Review Article Templates & Guidelines to ensure all article/ directory files use correct terminology and align with educational article series approach (FINAL PHASE).

---

## Key Requirements

### Scope of Review
Review consistency across all article template and guideline files:

**Article Files**:
1. `article/article-template.md` - Template for new articles
2. `article/article-guidelines.md` - Quality standards and writing guidelines
3. `article/article-series-structure.md` - Series organization
4. `article/article-voice-guide.md` - Tone and perspective
5. Any other files in article/ directory

**Cross-reference with**:
- `.claude/docs/workflows.md` (Phase 2 rewrite - article workflows and standards)
- `.claude/docs/architecture.md` (Phase 2 rewrite - article guidelines descriptions)
- `decisions.md` (Writing style and content strategy)
- Updated terminology from Phases 1-7

### What to Verify
- **Terminology**: Use "article" not "blog" throughout
- **Quality standards**: Align with MSc-level educational approach (1,500-3,000+ words)
- **Series approach**: Educational progression, not standalone blog posts
- **Voice guidance**: Match decisions.md writing style
- **Template structure**: Support educational article series
- **Guidelines**: Reference correct directories and workflows
- **Consistency**: Match Phase 2 documentation updates

### Success Criteria
- Identify inconsistencies or blog terminology in article files
- Find outdated guidance or misaligned standards
- Verify article files support educational series approach
- Apply fixes to align article files with Phase 1-7 updates
- Phase 8 marked complete in backlog
- **ENTIRE 8-PHASE REVIEW COMPLETE**

## Approach & Reasoning

**Review Strategy:**
1. List all files in article/ directory
2. Read each article template/guideline file
3. Cross-reference with workflows.md (Phase 2 article standards)
4. Cross-reference with architecture.md (Phase 2 descriptions)
5. Cross-reference with decisions.md (writing style)
6. Identify blog terminology or inconsistencies
7. Present findings with specific examples
8. Apply fixes to article files
9. Update backlog marking ALL 8 PHASES COMPLETE

**Why this order:**
- Article templates/guidelines are final pieces
- Must support educational article series (not blog posts)
- Should align with MSc-level standards from Phase 4
- Terminology must be consistent with Phases 1-7 updates
- These files guide actual article creation
