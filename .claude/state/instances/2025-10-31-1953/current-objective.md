## Agreed Objective

Phase 1: Review Workflow Protocol System to ensure Claude's interaction behavior matches user expectations and requirements.

---

## Key Requirements

### Scope of Review
Review consistency and accuracy across three key files:
1. `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` - Detailed protocol instructions
2. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Quick reference protocol section
3. `decisions.md` - Session Management decisions

### What to Verify
- **Interaction patterns**: Clarification, confirmation, execution flow
- **State management**: When/how to save objectives, use backlog
- **Session flow**: Resume, checkpoint, crash recovery
- **Consistency**: All three files say the same thing
- **Completeness**: Nothing missing or contradictory
- **User alignment**: Matches actual user intentions and preferences

### Success Criteria
- Identify any inconsistencies between the three files
- Find gaps or missing guidance
- Verify behavior matches user expectations
- Recommend fixes if needed
- User confirms protocol is accurate

---

## Approach & Reasoning

**Review Strategy:**
1. Read workflow-protocol.md in full (detailed source of truth)
2. Read CLAUDE.md protocol section (quick reference)
3. Read decisions.md Session Management section (rationale)
4. Cross-reference for consistency
5. Identify issues, gaps, or misalignments
6. Present findings with specific examples
7. Get user confirmation on any changes needed

**Why this order:**
- workflow-protocol.md is most detailed - sets baseline
- CLAUDE.md should summarize it accurately
- decisions.md should explain why protocol exists
- Cross-reference catches inconsistencies
- User validates findings before making changes

## Progress

**Completed:**
- ✅ Todo list created
- ✅ Objective saved
- ✅ Read workflow-protocol.md (253 lines)
- ✅ Read CLAUDE.md protocol section (lines 6-14)
- ✅ Read decisions.md Session Management section (lines 420-495)
- ✅ Analyzed consistency across all three files
- ✅ Identified 3 issues (multi-instance gaps, overview mechanism, file scope)
- ✅ Presented findings to user
- ✅ Updated workflow-protocol.md with multi-instance support

**In Progress:**
- Documenting completion

**Remaining:**
- None - Phase 1 complete

## Blockers / Questions

None currently.

## Context References

**Files Under Review:**
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md`
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `decisions.md`

**Part Of:**
- Comprehensive System Documentation Review (from backlog)
- Phase 1 of 8 phases

---

## Notes

This is the foundation phase - workflow protocol governs all Claude interactions. Getting this right ensures all future work feels natural and aligned with user expectations.
