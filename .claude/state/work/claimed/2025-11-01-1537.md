**Instance**: 2025-11-01-1537
**Created**: 2025-11-01 15:37
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-01 16:25 (by instance 2025-11-01-1525 documenting 1537's work)
**Status**: Active

**NOTE**: This file was created by instance 2025-11-01-1525 to document instance 1537's existing work as part of building the work coordination system. Instance 1537 should update this file directly in the future.

## Currently Working On

### Educational Theory Learning (General - Not Aikido Specific)
- **Source**: Self-initiated source discovery and learning
- **Claimed**: 2025-11-01 15:37
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Scope**: Learning general educational theory to inform Aikido teaching documentation
  - **INCLUDES**:
    - Motor learning & skill acquisition theory
    - Teaching methodology & instructional design
    - Sports psychology for martial arts
    - Injury prevention science
    - Biomechanics textbook identification (preliminary web search done)
  - **EXCLUDES**:
    - Aikido-specific technique documentation (Phase 3)
    - Aikido-specific error documentation (Phase 4 - application layer)
    - Aikido-specific teaching method documentation (Phase 4 - application layer)
    - YouTube timestamp cataloging (Phase 5)
- **Progress**: ~20% - Preliminary biomechanics source list created, ready to launch 4 learning agents
- **Blockers**: None currently
- **Deliverables Completed**:
  - `sources/books/biomechanics-textbooks-registry.md` (preliminary web search list)
  - `research/knowledge-domains-for-teaching.md` (comprehensive domain mapping)
  - `.claude/docs/design-principles.md` (WHY-first thinking framework)
  - `.claude/docs/collaboration-model.md` (professor-student relationship model)

### Planned Next: 4 Parallel Learning Agents (Not Yet Claimed)
**Approach**: Layered/breadth-first learning across domains

Agents planned (not yet launched as of 2025-11-01 16:25):
1. Motor Learning & Skill Acquisition
2. Teaching Methodology & Instructional Design
3. Sports Psychology for Martial Arts
4. Injury Prevention Science

**Note**: These are LEARNING agents (acquiring general theory), not DOCUMENTATION agents (applying to Aikido). This complements Phase 4 work (which documents Aikido-specific pedagogical knowledge).

## Relationship to Other Work

### Complements Phase 4 (Pedagogy)
**Instance 1537's work**: Learning general educational theory (what research says about motor learning, teaching, etc.)

**Phase 4 work**: Documenting Aikido-specific pedagogical knowledge (specific errors, specific teaching methods, specific progressions)

**Synergy**: Theory from 1537 informs how to document Aikido specifics in Phase 4. Both are valuable and non-overlapping.

### Does NOT Overlap With
- Phase 2 (Biomechanics) - 1537 identified sources, but not documenting principles
- Phase 3 (Syllabus) - 1537 not documenting techniques
- Phase 5 (YouTube) - 1537 not analyzing videos

---

## Completed

### System Documentation Enhancements
- **Completed**: 2025-11-01 16:05
- **Deliverables**:
  - Created `.claude/docs/design-principles.md` (WHY-first thinking)
  - Created `.claude/docs/collaboration-model.md` (professor-student model)
  - Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (added core principles)
  - Updated `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` (added WHY-first requirement)
- **Notes**: User feedback that "your thinking is very good but your recording of your thinking is not as deep" - addressed by adding WHY-first documentation requirement

## Notes

**Instance 1537's Focus**: Source discovery and educational theory learning

**Coordination**: Instance 1537 should update this file to claim any additional work. Currently their work does not overlap with Phases 2-5 documentation work.

**Recommendation**: 1537 can continue their learning work independently. When they're ready to APPLY their learning to document Aikido specifics, they can claim parts of Phase 4.
