- **Claimed**: 2025-11-01 17:35
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Scope**: BREADTH-FIRST reconnaissance of entire biomechanics field
  - INCLUDES: Survey ALL principle categories (structural, force, balance, efficiency, interaction)
  - INCLUDES: Identify 5-10 major kinesiology/biomechanics textbooks
  - INCLUDES: List 20-30 biomechanical principle categories (names only, not full documentation)
  - INCLUDES: Identify specialized sub-fields
  - INCLUDES: Flag valuable topics for future deep investigation
  - EXCLUDES: Deep documentation of principles (that's next phase)
  - EXCLUDES: Aikido-specific technique application (Phase 3)
- **Progress**: 0% - just claimed, starting survey
- **Blockers**: None
- **Deliverables Planned**:
  - research/biomechanics-landscape-survey.md (broad survey document)

## Mission

This is a BREADTH-FIRST survey, NOT deep documentation:
- Map the biomechanics landscape
- Discover what textbooks and resources exist
- List principle categories at a high level
- Identify specialized sub-fields
- Flag topics worth deeper investigation later

Focus: DISCOVERY and BREADTH over depth.
