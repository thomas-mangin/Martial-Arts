# Phase 2: External Biomechanics Research

**Status**: Available
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Information Architecture) - COMPLETE ✅
**Estimated Effort**: Large (multiple days/weeks of research and documentation)

---

## WHY This Work Matters

**Purpose**: Build rigorous scientific foundation for biomechanical principles that explain why Aikido techniques work.

**Problem it solves**:
- Current biomechanical understanding is incomplete and not scientifically validated
- Need exhaustive, scientifically-grounded principles to support educational authoring
- Cannot explain techniques credibly without solid scientific basis
- Blog-era principles were intuitive but not rigorously sourced

**Impact**:
- Enables scientific validation of technique documentation
- Provides credible foundation for teaching
- Connects Aikido practice to established science
- Supports textbook-level educational content

---

## Scope

### What This Includes

**External Research**:
- Identify and study kinesiology textbooks (Neumann, Knudson, etc.)
- Study biomechanics resources (movement science, mechanics)
- Review anatomy resources (skeletal structure, joints, muscles)
- Research structural engineering principles (load transfer, stability)
- Study physics relevant to movement (force, leverage, momentum)
- Review sports science research (motor learning, performance)

**Principle Documentation**:
- Document 20+ biomechanical principles using `templates/principle-template.md`
- Categories to cover:
  - Structural principles (alignment, posture, load transfer, stability)
  - Force principles (generation, transfer, leverage, kinetic chain)
  - Balance principles (kuzushi, recovery, center of gravity)
  - Efficiency principles (minimal effort, natural mechanics, relaxation)
  - Interaction principles (blending, connection, sensitivity)

**Validation**:
- Scientific sources cited for each principle
- Multiple sources where possible
- Cross-reference to existing Aikido research if available

### What This Excludes

- Aikido-specific technique documentation (that's Phase 3)
- Teaching methodology and pedagogy (that's Phase 4)
- Common errors documentation (that's Phase 4)
- YouTube analysis (that's Phase 5)
- Application of principles to techniques (happens in Phase 3)

## Success Criteria

**Completeness**:
- ✅ At least 20 principles documented across all 5 categories
- ✅ Each principle uses `templates/principle-template.md` format
- ✅ All principles validated with scientific sources

**Quality**:
- ✅ Each principle has clear definition (what it IS and is NOT)
- ✅ Scientific basis explained (anatomy + physics/mechanics)
- ✅ At least 2 academic sources cited per principle
- ✅ Teaching approach documented (how to explain)
- ✅ At least 2 metaphors/analogies provided per principle
- ✅ Principles pass `validation/principle-validation-checklist.md`

**Integration**:
- ✅ Principle index created and complete
- ✅ Bibliography comprehensive
- ✅ Validation summary explains source quality

**Usability**:
- ✅ Can use these principles to explain technique mechanics (ready for Phase 3)
- ✅ Principles are teachable (not too abstract)
- ✅ Scientifically credible (can cite sources with confidence)

## Resources

**Templates**:
- `templates/principle-template.md` - Use this for every principle

**Validation**:
- `validation/principle-validation-checklist.md` - Check each principle against this

**Existing Work**:
- `research/biomechanics/` - Existing intuitive principles (not rigorously sourced yet)
- Can use as starting point but must validate scientifically

**Source Discovery**:
- `sources/books/biomechanics-textbooks-registry.md` - Preliminary list from instance 1537
- Use as starting point for identifying resources

**Architecture Reference**:
- `research/knowledge-architecture.md` - Domain 2 section explains principle documentation

## Notes

**Depth over speed**: This is multi-week work potentially. Quality and scientific rigor matter more than completion speed.

**Source acquisition**: May need to obtain textbooks (library, purchase, online courses). Budget/access considerations.

**Iterative refinement**: First pass documentation, then refine as understanding deepens.

**Cross-domain learning**: Agent doing this work will learn kinesiology/biomechanics - valuable knowledge for other phases.
