## Active Backlog

Tasks that are pending but not currently being worked on.

### Comprehensive System Documentation Review
**Priority**: Medium
**Paused Date**: 2025-10-31
**Reason**: System review can wait - prioritizing multi-instance support for practical usability

**Objective**: Conduct extensive, exhaustive review of ALL system documentation to ensure the implemented system matches user intentions and requirements across all aspects: workflow protocol, decisions, article review processes, content creation guidelines, and all other documented systems.

**Progress Made**:
- Objective saved with chunked methodology
- 8-phase plan created with systematic coverage approach
- ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Workflow Protocol System (updated workflow-protocol.md for multi-instance)
- ✅ **Phase 2 COMPLETE**: Architecture & Command System (rewrote all three files for article series + multi-instance)
  - architecture.md: Complete rewrite (blog → article series, added multi-instance architecture)
  - workflows.md: Complete rewrite (article workflows, MSc-level standards, multi-instance)
  - commands-reference.md: Complete rewrite (all commands documented, correct terminology)
- ✅ **Phase 3 COMPLETE**: Session Management Commands (quick fixes for terminology consistency)
  - resume.md: Already correct ✅
  - checkpoint.md: Fixed blog → article terminology in examples
  - save-objective.md: Clarified instance path priority
  - pause-task.md: Already correct ✅
  - CLAUDE.md: Updated git push statement (automatic push documented)
- ✅ **Phase 4 COMPLETE**: Content Creation Commands (minor fixes for article standards)
  - discuss.md: Already correct ✅
  - extract.md: Added educational focus note and word count target (1,500-3,000+)
  - review-aikido.md: Updated quality standard to "MSc-level" (more precise)
  - decisions.md: Fixed ToC "blog" → "article"

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 5: Source Discovery Commands (/track-source, /scan-sources, /youtube)
- Phase 6: Multi-Instance Commands (/instances, /cleanup-instances)
- Phase 7: Research Documentation (research/INDEX.md and all research files)
- Phase 8: Article Templates & Guidelines (article/ directory)

**Context Files**:
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` ⭐
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `decisions.md`
- `.claude/docs/architecture.md`
- `.claude/docs/workflows.md`
- `.claude/docs/commands-reference.md`
- All command files in `.claude/commands/`
- `research/INDEX.md` and all research files
- `article/` templates
- See current-objective.md (paused version) for full context
