Tasks that are pending but not currently being worked on.

### Comprehensive System Documentation Review
**Priority**: Medium
**Paused Date**: 2025-10-31
**Reason**: System review can wait - prioritizing multi-instance support for practical usability

**Progress Made**:
- Objective saved with chunked methodology
- 8-phase plan created with systematic coverage approach
- Ready to begin Phase 1 (Workflow Protocol System)

**Next Steps**:
- Start Phase 1: Review workflow-protocol.md section by section
- Review CLAUDE.md protocol section
- Review decisions.md workflow entry
- Verify consistency across these three documents
- Continue through remaining 7 phases methodically

**Context Files**:
- `.claude/docs/workflow-protocol.md` ‚≠ê
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `decisions.md`
- `.claude/docs/architecture.md`
- `.claude/docs/workflows.md`
