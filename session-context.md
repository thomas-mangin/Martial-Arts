# Session Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

## Current Status
<!-- What you're currently working on -->
**Data Gathering Phase - Active Collection** - Biomechanical principles now at 25+ (ongoing), areas-needing-development.md now has 13 major topics with comprehensive frameworks ready for /discuss sessions.

## Recent Work
<!-- What was accomplished in the last session -->

**This Session (2025-10-30 Extended)**: Major expansion of biomechanics and topic frameworks

- **BIOMECHANICAL PRINCIPLES EXPANDED**: 23 → 25+ principles (ongoing collection)
  - Principle #24: Weight Transfer Timing (strike before foot grounds)
  - Principle #25: Hip Rotation Power and Tai Sabaki (cross-discipline validation)
  - Updated status to "actively gathering" (not fixed list)

- **WEAPONS FRAMEWORK MASSIVELY EXPANDED** (Topic #1 in areas-needing-development.md):
  - Added Indian Clubs connection (speed/power through circular motion)
  - Added HEMA parallels (weapon rotation, center of gravity)
  - Added jo kata pedagogy: 31st teaches centerline (like Wing Chun), 13th develops fluidity
  - Added jo vs ken stance differences (why weapons require different footwork)
  - Now comprehensive framework requiring multiple /discuss sessions (Session A/B/C structure)
  - 15+ blog posts potential from weapons framework alone

- **THREE MAJOR NEW TOPICS ADDED** to areas-needing-development.md:

  1. **Stance Principles** (Topic #9) ⭐⭐:
     - Three requirements: stability, power, movement (three-way balance)
     - CRITICAL INSIGHT: Stances are transitions, not destinations
     - Jo vs ken stance differences (weapon properties dictate stance)
     - 40+ questions, 10+ blog posts potential

  2. **Demonstration Robotization Problem** (Topic #10) ⭐⭐⭐:
     - How teaching destroys teacher's fluidity (repeating rigid demonstrations)
     - Vicious cycle: rigid demos → rigid students → rigid teachers
     - "Do as I say, not as I do" problem
     - 35+ questions, 8+ blog posts potential
     - CRITICAL teaching issue affecting entire aikido community

  3. **Contextual Design of Martial Arts** (Topic #11) ⭐⭐⭐:
     - Fundamental framework: martial arts designed for specific contexts, not vacuum
     - Seven context examples: Krav Maga (time), Silat (environment), karambit (clothing), ground fighting (public), aikido (weapons), historical, legal
     - Extends honest assessment about aikido to ALL martial arts
     - Resolves "my art vs your art" arguments by reframing question
     - 50+ questions, 15+ blog posts potential

**Previous Session Work**:
- Created **core-values.md** - Fundamental beliefs as martial artist:
  - Teaching philosophy (biomechanics over mysticism)
  - Knowing vs. Embodied mastery framework
  - Physical progression (5 stages: hands→feet→timing→core→patterns)
  - Iwama approach (structure good, relaxation often missing)
  - **Background section**: Military service (les chasseurs), knife attack defense, veteran observations
  - **Critical insight**: Veterans avoid conflict; fantasists seek it
  - **Honest positioning**: First dan, not great fighter, values honesty over ego
- Created **divisive-topics.md** - 8 major martial arts debates:
  - Aikido-specific: Peace vs. martial, Iwama vs. blending, Ki vs. biomechanics
  - General: Kata vs. alive training, traditional vs. modern, competition
  - Cross-discipline: Hard vs. soft, weapons vs. empty hand
  - **Filled in peace vs. martial stance**: Both/and, peace through understanding cost
- Created **learning-journey.md** - Comprehensive mastery framework:
  - Knowing (intellectual) vs. Embodied (natural movement)
  - **Physical progression detail**: 5 stages with characteristics, teaching focus, signs of progress
  - Stage 4 is the critical shift: hands move body → core moves hands
  - **Pattern recognition**: Same principle, different applications (taking balance example)
  - Kinetic energy transfer: body → arm → hand (difficulty increases with joints)
  - Kata as alphabet concept: Forms are foundation, not scripture
  - 18+ blog post ideas generated from frameworks
- Created **biomechanical-principles.md** - **23 core principles** documented:
  - Foundation mechanics (1-10): Leverage, gravity, balance, Newton's laws, kinetic chain, alignment, snap movement
  - Application mechanics (11-17): Surface area, targets, deflection, natural walking, foot mechanics, directional vulnerability
  - Advanced concepts (18-23): Tension/relaxation, upward redirection, joint vulnerability, deflect before lock, weapons assumption, remove expected resistance
  - Each principle includes: explanation, aikido applications, teaching implications, blog topics
  - Quick reference guide at top for all 23 principles
  - **60+ blog topics generated** from biomechanical analysis
- Created **blog-series-structure.md** - 10 progressive learning series:
  - Series 1: Biomechanics Foundations (6 posts)
  - Series 2: The Learning Journey (5 posts)
  - Series 3: Kata Philosophy (4 posts)
  - Series 4: Peace and Violence (5 posts)
  - Series 5: Deflection and Angles (4 posts)
  - Series 6: The Iwama Question (4 posts)
  - Series 7: Movement Mechanics (5 posts)
  - Series 8: Teaching Aikido (5 posts)
  - Series 9: Cross-Discipline Insights (5 posts)
  - Series 10: Solo Training (4 posts)
  - **50+ posts organized** into progressive reader paths
- Created **SESSION-SUMMARY-BIOMECHANICS.md** - Comprehensive overview for easy reference
- Created **areas-needing-development.md** - Topics requiring /discuss before blog writing:
  - **High priority**: Weapons training develops biomechanics, Aikido sword = Wing Chun hands, circle principle
  - 10+ topics identified with gaps, questions for /discuss, blog potential
  - Ready-to-write topics also identified (sufficient material exists)
- **UPDATED COMMANDS**: Integrated authenticity system
  - /discuss: Checks core values before starting discussion
  - /review-aikido: Checks value alignment, divisive topic handling, authenticity
- **UPDATED GUIDELINES**:
  - blog-guidelines.md: Added "Authenticity: Writing from Your Core Values" section
  - blog-guidelines.md: Added "Your Voice & Perspective" with first-dan framing
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md: Documented "Authenticity & Philosophical Grounding System"
- **DECISIONS LOGGED**:
  - Honest positioning as first dan (Stages 1-3 experience, Stage 4 emerging, Stage 5 observation)
  - Background context (military, knife attack, veteran observations)
  - Peace vs. martial stance: Both/and, peace through strength

## Next Steps
<!-- What to do next -->

1. **Priority /discuss Sessions** (tracked in todos, see areas-needing-development.md for full details):

   **HIGHEST PRIORITY** (foundational frameworks):
   - `/discuss` **COMPREHENSIVE Weapons Framework** ⭐⭐⭐ - Indian clubs, HEMA, jo kata pedagogy (31st/13th), weapons→taijutsu transfer, jo vs ken stances (may need 3 separate sessions: A/B/C)
   - `/discuss` **Contextual Design of Martial Arts** ⭐⭐⭐ - Krav Maga, Silat, karambit, ground fighting, seven contexts showing arts designed for specific purposes (extends honest assessment to all martial arts)
   - `/discuss` **Demonstration Robotization** ⭐⭐⭐ - Critical teaching problem: how demonstrating destroys teacher's fluidity, vicious cycle affecting entire community

   **VERY HIGH PRIORITY** (technical foundations):
   - `/discuss` **Stance Principles** ⭐⭐ - Stability/power/movement three-way balance, stances as transitions not destinations, jo vs ken differences
   - `/discuss` **Circle Principle** ⭐ - Widely misunderstood, deflection and balance taking mechanics

2. **Blog Post Ideas Status**:
   - **80+ total ideas** now (increased from 70+)
   - 25+ biomechanical principles (ongoing collection, each generating 2-3+ blog ideas)
   - 15+ from weapons framework alone
   - 10+ from stance principles
   - 8+ from demonstration robotization
   - 15+ from contextual design
   - Plus: learning-journey (18+), source scans (10), YouTube (5)
   - **Organized into 10 progressive series** (blog-series-structure.md)
   - **Most need /discuss depth first** before writing

3. **Some Topics Ready to Write** (sufficient material without /discuss):
   - Newton's Third Law in Aikido (Principle #7)
   - The Kinetic Chain (Principle #8)
   - Weight Transfer Timing (Principle #24 - just added)
   - Hip Rotation and Tai Sabaki (Principle #25 - just added)
   - Those Who've Faced Violence vs. Those Who Imagine It (veteran observations)
   - Knowing vs. Embodied Understanding (learning-journey.md)
   - Kata as Alphabet (learning-journey.md)

4. **After Each /discuss Session**:
   - Capture insights in discussions/ directory
   - Update areas-needing-development.md (mark topic as sufficiently developed)
   - Move to "Ready to Write" section
   - Then write blog posts with proper depth

## Blockers/Questions
<!-- Anything that needs decision or is blocking progress -->
None - system is complete and ready

## Notes
<!-- Any other context that would be helpful -->
