## Current Status

**System Phase**: Learning Phase - Building Teaching Knowledge Foundation

**Active Instance**: 2025-11-01-1537 - Learning domain research

**Layer 1 Research COMPLETE**: Priority 1 domains researched with breadth-first approach
- Motor Learning & Skill Acquisition ✅
- Teaching Methodology & Instructional Design ✅
- Sports Psychology for Martial Arts ✅
- Injury Prevention Science ✅
- Integration & synthesis complete ✅
- Critical insights documented ✅

**Research Output**: 11 major documents in `research/` directory
- 4 domain research files in `research/learning-domains/`
- 1 integration document
- 3 critical insight documents
- 2 system documentation files (design principles, collaboration model)
- 1 domain mapping document

**Status**: Awaiting user direction on next phase (deeper layers, new domains, analysis, or authoring)

## Recent Work

**Learning Domain Research Complete** (Instance 2025-11-01-1537):
- Mapped 7 knowledge domains needed for teaching Aikido
- Completed Layer 1 (breadth) research across 4 Priority 1 domains
- Created integration document synthesizing cross-domain insights
- Documented critical insights: training constraints, compliance problem, trade-offs perspective
- Established WHY-first thinking and collaboration model in system documentation

## Next Steps

### Awaiting User Direction on Learning Phase Continuation

**User's Framework**: "When I think the system is complete I will toggle from learning to analysis and then authoring"

**Current State**: Layer 1 learning complete across 4 Priority 1 domains

**Your Options**:

**Option 1: Continue Learning - Layer 2 (Go Deeper)**
- Expand each core concept from Layer 1
- Additional resources for depth
- Practical application examples
- More integration work

**Option 2: Continue Learning - Priority 2 Domains (Go Broader)**
- Formal biomechanics study (deepen existing strength)
- Functional anatomy (muscle/joint specifics)
- Exercise physiology (energy systems, conditioning)
- Curriculum design (long-term program structure)

**Option 3: Move to Analysis Phase**
- Synthesize all learning for article writing
- Identify key teaching principles to communicate
- Plan article series based on research
- Create teaching framework

**Option 4: Address Specific Gaps**
- Transfer research (how learning transfers between contexts)
- Assessment methods (measuring student progress)
- Other areas identified during Layer 1

**Option 5: Begin Article Writing with Current Knowledge**
- Apply learning research to article development
- Write with evidence-based teaching principles
- Focus on articles that benefit most from research completed

## Blockers/Questions

**None currently**

Layer 1 research complete. Awaiting user signal on direction (continue learning, analysis, or authoring).

## Notes

**Session Significance** (Instance 2025-11-01-1537):
- Established evidence-based foundation for teaching Aikido
- Completed breadth-first survey of 4 critical knowledge domains
- Documented mature perspective on training trade-offs and multiple valid paths
- Created system documentation for WHY-first thinking and collaboration model

**Key Insights Captured**:
1. **Training constraints**: Danger constraint is real, but Aikido often uses it as excuse
2. **Compliance problem**: "Looks nice but is not martial" - legitimate reputation issue
3. **Multiple paths**: "This problem can not be resolved. You train what you want." - Mountain metaphor
4. **Age and wisdom**: Old masters were fierce fighters who became philosophical
5. **Trade-offs are real**: MMA/BJJ have high injury rates, Aikido has compliance problem - both valid criticisms

**Research Output**: 11 major documents establishing foundation for evidence-based teaching approach

**Other Active Work**:
- YouTube transcript research base (1,983 transcripts across 5 channels) available for article writing
- Biomechanics research organized in `research/biomechanics/` directory
- Article series infrastructure ready in `articles/` directory
