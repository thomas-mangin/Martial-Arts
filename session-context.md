## Current Status

**System Restructure: Blog ‚Üí Educational Article Series** üîÑ

Converting project from blog-focused to educational article series designed for book publication. Focus on comprehensive depth, progressive learning, and self-consistency rather than engagement and standalone posts.

**Completed This Session**:
- ‚úÖ Loaded previous session state via `/resume`
- ‚úÖ Updated decisions.md: Added educational article series best practices
- ‚úÖ Updated decisions.md: Added progressive series structure and comprehensive depth principles
- ‚úÖ Updated OVERVIEW.md (.claude/CLAUDE.md): Changed all blog references to articles
- ‚úÖ Updated session-context.md: Reflect article series focus
- ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS: Renaming blog/ directory, updating templates and guidelines
- ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS: Updating command documentation for article workflow

**Analysis Complete**: 5 of 6 channels
1. **Hein's Approach** - 224 transcripts - Modern systematic positional framework
2. **Tony Sargeant** - 456 transcripts - Traditional Iwama with brutal honesty
3. **Alexander Gent** - 85 transcripts - Bridge between traditional and alive training
4. **Matthieu Jeandel** - 3 transcripts - Limited (insufficient data)
5. **SenshinOne** - 1,124 transcripts - Deep internal/philosophical approach ‚≠ê **NEW**
6. **Guillaume Erard** - 91 transcripts - Not recommended for analysis (demo videos only)

**Total Research Base**:
- 1,983 transcript files across all channels
- 60+ blog post ideas ready for writing
- 5 distinct teaching philosophies documented
- Cross-reference opportunities identified

## Recent Work (This Session)

### Multi-Channel Synthesis Creation

**Trigger**: User selected Option 1 (Multi-Channel Synthesis) after session resume.

**Analysis Results**:
- **5 universal agreements** identified (ALL 4 channels agree)
  1. Weapons training is foundational, not supplementary
  2. Modern Aikido has serious effectiveness problems
  3. Training quality matters more than quantity
  4. Traditional forms encode tactical/biomechanical logic
  5. Training purpose varies validly across contexts

- **4 productive contrasts** mapped (different perspectives)
  1. Aiki definitions: Adhesion (S) vs. Timing (H) vs. Kokyu (T) vs. Flow (A)
  2. Training purpose: Survival (H) vs. Spiritual (S) vs. Traditional (T) vs. Both/and (A)
  3. Internal vs. External emphasis: Cultivation (T, S) vs. Tactics (H) vs. Bridge (A)
  4. Technique framing: Finite system (H) vs. Shapes to transcend (T, S) vs. Progression (A)

- **Unique contributions** documented for each instructor
- **Research strengths and gaps** assessed
- **Citation framework** created for blog writing

**Files Created**:
1. `sources/youtube/findings/2025-10-31-multi-channel-synthesis.md` (32KB comprehensive synthesis)
2. `sources/youtube/blog-ideas-multi-source.md` (15KB quick reference with citations)

**Key Insight**: Apparent disagreements among instructors often reflect different emphases rather than true contradictions. Universal agreements provide strongest validation for blog claims; productive contrasts enable rich dialogue.

**Git Commit**: 06dcd05 (synthesis files committed, though commit message incorrectly referenced biomechanics)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Complete System Restructure

**Goal**: Finish converting all blog-related files and documentation to article series approach

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Update `blog/` directory guidelines files to article standards
2. Update article templates (rename blog-template.md ‚Üí article-template.md)
3. Update command documentation (`.claude/commands/`) for article workflow
4. Update `topics.md` to track article series progress instead of blog topic queue
5. Consider creating `articles/` directory structure (or keep `blog/` as legacy name)

**After Restructure Complete**:
- System will be ready for writing educational article series
- All references to "blog posts" will be changed to "articles"
- All best practices will reflect educational depth vs. engagement focus
- Commands and workflows will support progressive series writing

**Note**: User has extensive Iwama syllabus knowledge that should be captured as part of article series (detailed "how to perform" instructions for techniques, weapons kata, etc.)

## Blockers/Questions

**None currently**

All major YouTube channel downloads and analyses complete. Ready to proceed with cross-referencing and blog writing phases.

## Notes

**Session Significance**: Completed final major channel analysis (SenshinOne), bringing total analyzed channels to 5 with diverse perspectives. Now have sufficient multi-source research base for nuanced, well-referenced blog content creation.

**Research Milestone**: 1,983 transcripts represent comprehensive coverage of major Aikido YouTube instruction across multiple philosophies:
- Modern systematic (Hein)
- Traditional Iwama (Tony)
- Alive training bridge (Alexander)
- Internal/philosophical (SenshinOne)
- Limited traditional Takemusu (Matthieu)

**Ready for**: Blog writing phase with strong multi-source validation capability.

**Previous Session Context** (2025-10-31 04:30):
- Completed biomechanics reorganization (split 1,796-line file into 7 categories)
- Created research/biomechanics/ directory with INDEX.md
- All 32 principles and 90+ blog ideas preserved in organized structure
