## Recent Work (This Session)

### SenshinOne Channel Analysis Completion

**Trigger**: Overnight downloads completed successfully, enabling final channel analysis.

**Analysis Results**:
- **12 major themes** identified with cross-video consistency
- **15 high-value blog ideas** generated (beginners → advanced → instructors → cross-training)
- **Top 20 videos** curated for research
- **Teaching philosophy** fully documented
- **Research value**: ★★★★★ (Exceptional for advanced/philosophical content)

**Unique Findings**:
- Rejects "aiki as blending" - defines as "adhesion/seizure" instead
- Deep Daoist philosophical framework (yin-yang, wuwei, triune cosmogony)
- Egotripartite mind model (fear, pride, ignorance)
- Rare BJJ integration among Aikido instructors
- 15-year pedagogical evolution visible in content

**Files Created**:
1. `sources/youtube/findings/2025-10-31-senshinone-channel-analysis.md` (comprehensive analysis)
2. `sources/youtube/registry/senshinone.md` (quick reference)
3. `sessions/session-2025-10-31-0949.md` (this session summary)

**Git Commit**: 6d7e12a (2,476 files, 1.9M+ lines)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Cross-Reference Synthesis

**Option 1: Multi-Channel Synthesis** (Recommended)
- Compare all 5 channels' perspectives on key concepts
- Identify complementary vs. contrasting viewpoints
- Strengthen blog post ideas with multi-source validation
- Create synthesis document mapping themes across instructors
- Time: 1-2 hours

**Option 2: Start Blog Writing**
- Pick from 60+ ready blog ideas
- Multiple expert perspectives available for validation
- Suggested first posts:
  1. "Aiki is Not Blending" - SenshinOne's unique paradigm vs. traditional views
  2. "The Four Positions" - Hein's systematic framework
  3. "Why Aikido Techniques Look Weird (Until You Add Weapons)" - Cross-reference Hein + Tony

**Option 3: Additional Research Infrastructure**
- Create blog post template with multi-source citation system
- Develop glossary of terms across different teaching styles
- Map blog ideas to source videos for easy reference
