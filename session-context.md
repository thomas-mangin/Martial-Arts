## Current Status

**Work Tracking Integrated - System 100% Ready**: Backlog tracking distributed into integrated system. All incomplete work now tracked in context (syllabus/BACKLOG.md, sources/youtube/ANALYSIS-QUEUE.md, research/areas-needing-development.md). PROJECT-STATUS.md provides strategic overview.

**System Architecture**:
- `/syllabus/` = Factual information + BACKLOG.md for gaps ✓ COMPLETE
- `/research/` = Frameworks + areas-needing-development.md for topics ✓ VALIDATED
- `/sources/youtube/` = Analysis + ANALYSIS-QUEUE.md for priorities ✓ ORGANIZED
- **Slash commands** = Syllabus-aware ✓ INTEGRATED
- **Backlog tracking** = Distributed and contextual ✓ INTEGRATED
- **PROJECT-STATUS.md** = Strategic overview ✓ CREATED

**Key Achievement**: Complete workflow integration with distributed backlog tracking. System is production-ready and all incomplete work is visible in appropriate context.

**Ready for**: Write first blog post to validate complete workflow end-to-end.

## Recent Work (This Session)

### 1. Backlog Tracking Distribution (Option A Implementation)
**Objective**: Break down monolithic incomplete-work-backlog.md into integrated, contextual tracking system

**Problem Identified**:
- User asked if backlog document was integrated with system
- Monolithic 684-line file not referenced in CLAUDE.md
- Overlapped with existing tracking files
- Too large to scan quickly, mixed strategic/tactical content

**Solution Implemented**:
Distributed tracking into 4 integrated files:

1. **PROJECT-STATUS.md** (root) - Strategic overview
   - Current phase (System Validation - Ready to Write)
   - 85-100% systems complete
   - 5-phase roadmap (Validation → Foundation → Expansion → Production → Depth)
   - Estimated work by priority (179-272 hours total)
   - Success metrics and key principles
   - Updated monthly or after milestones

2. **syllabus/BACKLOG.md** - Tactical syllabus gaps
   - Missing technique files (~45 needed, have 4)
   - Incomplete weapons files (5 with frameworks only)
   - Missing rank files (0/10)
   - Known unknowns in existing files (10 files with TO BE FILLED sections)
   - Add strategically as blog posts require

3. **sources/youtube/ANALYSIS-QUEUE.md** - Video analysis priorities
   - Tony Sargeant priority series (Teachers Intro, Improving Your Aikido, Ki Musubi)
   - Alexander Gent status (complete)
   - Other channels (Jesse Enkamp, Maul Morie, Kevin Lee)
   - 20-28 hours for priority series
   - Strategic sampling vs. deep analysis approach

4. **research/areas-needing-development.md** - Enhanced with new topics
   - Added 4 new high-priority topics (Ki Demystification, Ukemi, Ma-ai, Atemi)
   - Now 15+ topics needing /discuss sessions
   - Cross-references to other backlog files
   - Blog potential estimated for each

**Files Updated**:
- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`**: Added PROJECT-STATUS.md and backlog files to core documents
- **`research/areas-needing-development.md`**: Added new topics and cross-references

**Files Removed**:
- `incomplete-work-backlog.md` (684 lines → distributed appropriately)

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth (gaps tracked where work happens)
- Better discovery (find gaps in context)
- Easier maintenance (update while working, not separately)
- Strategic vs. tactical separation (PROJECT-STATUS vs. backlog files)

### 2. Previous Session Work (Slash Command Integration with Syllabus)
**Objective**: Make all writing/review commands syllabus-aware for automatic technical accuracy checking

**Files Updated**:
- **`.claude/commands/review-aikido.md`**: Added syllabus references throughout
  - Terminology section now references `/syllabus/terminology.md` (100+ term dictionary)
  - Technical accuracy section verifies against all syllabus files
  - Kata sequence verification for weapons content
  - Rank-appropriateness checks
  - Updated Critical Standards Checklist with syllabus verification

- **`.claude/commands/discuss.md`**: Added syllabus to context checking
  - References terminology, techniques, kata sequences during discussion
  - Grounds discussions in documented facts before interpretation
  - Added syllabus reference fields to discussion note template

- **`blog/blog-guidelines.md`**: Added comprehensive verification section
  - New section: "Using the Syllabus for Technical Verification"
  - Documented what syllabus contains (5 major areas detailed)
  - Provided clear workflow: draft → verify → correct → review
  - Explained syllabus (facts) vs research (interpretation) distinction
  - Added examples of proper fact verification

**Impact**:
- All commands now leverage 100+ term dictionary automatically
- Complete kata sequences (31 jo, 13 jo) accessible during writing/review
- Technical accuracy grounded in documented syllabus files
- Blog posts will have higher technical accuracy from the start
- Clear separation between factual reference and interpretation

### 2. Previous Session Work (Website Analysis & Integration)
**Objective**: Extract missing syllabus information from takemusu-iwama-aikido.org and related sources

**Sources Analyzed**:
- **Takemusu Iwama Aikido Website** (https://takemusu-iwama-aikido.org/)
  - Comprehensive Aikido Dictionary page
  - Kata structure pages (video-focused, limited written details)
- **AikidoFAQ.com** (via alternative sources due to SSL certificate expiry)
  - 31 Jo Kata details via Yumpu.com
  - 13 Jo Kata details via Budo Inochi website
  - Kumitachi references

**Key Finding**: Existing syllabus system is MORE comprehensive than public websites for written reference. Websites are primarily video libraries with limited written documentation.

### 2. Major Additions to Syllabus

  - Complete rank system (Kyu through Judan - 10th dan)
  - Philosophical concepts (Takemusu Aiki, Misogi, Kuden, Zanshin, etc.)
  - Techniques, attacks, equipment, etiquette

**B. Complete 31 Jo Kata Sequence**
- Added to `syllabus/weapons/jo/suburi.md`

  - Starting position (left kamae, hand positions)
  - Movement-by-movement sequence (1-31)
  - Key learning points (foot returns to start at 10, 12, 18, 26)
  - Historical context (O-Sensei created post-WWII, Saito formalized)
  - Relationship to Roku no Jo (6 jo kata = movements 13-18)

**C. Complete 13 Jo Kata Sequence**
- Added to `syllabus/weapons/jo/13-jo-kata.md`
- All 13 movements with Japanese names, translations, detailed descriptions
- Source: AikidoFAQ.com (via Budo Inochi website)
- Includes:
  - Each movement's connection to the 20 jo suburi
  - Starting position (hidari-hanmi kamae) and closing position
  - Key points for each technique
  - Stance transitions (left/right hanmi throughout)
  - Technical details (angles, directions, targets)

### 3. Files Modified This Session

- `syllabus/weapons/jo/10-kumijo.md`
- `syllabus/weapons/jo/31-kumijo.md`
- `syllabus/weapons/ken-tai-jo.md`

**Total Changes**: 10 files (1,832 insertions, 76 deletions)

### 4. System Validation
**Discovery**: Public online resources (takemusu-iwama-aikido.org, aikidofaq.com) are:
- **Video-focused**: Most content is embedded videos (Saito Sensei, Tony Sargeant)
- **Limited written detail**: General information, not detailed movement sequences
- **Reference libraries**: Good for overview, not comprehensive written syllabus

**Your Syllabus Advantages**:
- Progressive rank requirements documented in detail
- "Known unknowns" tracking system
- Cross-references to research frameworks
- Integration with video analysis (Tony Sargeant, Alexander Gent)
- Personal notes from first-dan perspective
- Complete kata sequences in written form

## Notes

**Session Significance**: Completed full workflow integration. The syllabus system (enhanced in previous session) is now integrated into all slash commands. This creates a seamless workflow where technical accuracy is automatically verified during writing and review.

**Key Achievement**: Made `/review-aikido`, `/discuss`, and blog guidelines syllabus-aware. Commands now automatically reference 100+ term dictionary, complete kata sequences, and technical documentation without manual lookup.

**Workflow Integration**:
- **Before**: Syllabus existed but required manual reference during writing
- **After**: Slash commands automatically leverage syllabus for accuracy checking
- **Result**: Technical accuracy built into workflow, not added as afterthought

**System Completeness**:
- ✓ Syllabus: Comprehensive factual reference (terminology, techniques, kata, ranks)
- ✓ Research: Validated frameworks and analysis
- ✓ Commands: Integrated with syllabus for automatic verification
- ✓ Guidelines: Clear instructions for using syllabus during writing

**System Philosophy**: Separation of facts (syllabus) from interpretation (research) is now enforced by the workflow itself. Commands ground discussions in facts before exploring interpretation.

**Ready to Write**: All infrastructure complete. Next session should start actual blog writing to test the integrated workflow end-to-end.
