## Current Status

**Information Architecture - System Optimization Complete**

Created comprehensive information routing system to maintain clean architecture and prevent file bloat. All file types and locations now have explicit routing rules.

**Completed This Session**:
- ✅ Created complete information routing guide (.claude/docs/information-routing.md)
- ✅ Added violence contexts framework to research/divisive-topics.md
- ✅ Documented 14 routing categories with decision tree
- ✅ Updated architecture.md with routing reference

**Background Context** (from previous sessions):
- 4 YouTube channel analyses complete (35,000+ words)
- 45+ blog post ideas generated
- Additional transcript downloads may have completed overnight

## Recent Work (This Session)

### Information Routing System Creation

**Problem Identified**: User shared violence contexts framework, and I initially misplaced it in decisions.md (behavioral instructions) instead of research/divisive-topics.md (conceptual knowledge).

**Root Cause**: No clear routing rules for where different types of information should be stored.

**Solution Created**:
1. **Comprehensive Routing Guide** - `.claude/docs/information-routing.md`
   - 14 routing categories covering all file types
   - 12-step decision tree for routing new information
   - Quick reference table with test questions
   - Examples showing correct routing

2. **Categories Documented**:
   - decisions.md - Behavioral instructions only
   - syllabus/ - Technical Aikido instruction
   - research/ - Conceptual frameworks and philosophy
   - session-context.md - Current session state
   - PROJECT-STATUS.md - Project phases and roadmap
   - topics.md - Blog content planning
   - sources/ - External content
   - blog/ - Writing standards
   - README.md - Getting started guide
   - help.md (future: help/) - User documentation
   - .claude/docs/ - System internals
   - scripts/ - Utility code
   - sessions/ - Auto-generated history
   - posts/discussions/ - Your content

3. **Moved Violence Contexts Framework** - From decisions.md to research/divisive-topics.md
   - Four violence types: Monkey Dance, Predatory, Sport/Cage, War
   - Context-specific effectiveness analysis
   - Critical for understanding "does Aikido work?" debates

4. **Updated Architecture** - Added routing guide reference to architecture.md

## Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE: Clean Up Workspace

**Issue Discovered**: 150+ YouTube transcript files (.srt, .json, .txt) in wrong location
- Currently in: `sources/youtube/transcripts/` (working directory)
- Should organize into proper channel subdirectories or clean up

**Actions Needed**:
1. Investigate which channels these transcripts belong to
2. Move to proper `sources/youtube/transcripts/[channel-name]/` structure
3. Or delete if duplicates/test downloads

### AFTER CLEANUP:

**Option A: Continue YouTube Analysis**
- Check if SenshinOne/Guillaume Erard downloads completed
- Analyze remaining channels if transcripts available
- Complete 6-channel analysis set

**Option B: Begin Blog Writing** (45+ ideas ready from 4 channel analyses)
- Start with high-priority topics:
  - The Four Types of Violence: Why Context Determines What Works (NEW from this session)
  - The Four Positions: A Framework for Understanding Aikido Techniques
  - Why Aikido Techniques Look Weird (Until You Add Weapons)
  - The Shoot Aikido Approach: When Traditional Meets Alive Training

**Option C: System Maintenance**
- Review help.md structure (consider help/ folder as noted in routing guide)
- Handle SYSTEM_REVIEW.md and .crush/ (deferred from this session)
- Investigate research.md vs research/INDEX.md relationship

## Notes

**Session Focus**: Information architecture improvement triggered by user feedback

**Key Learning**: When user shares information, the system must have clear rules for where to store it. The routing guide now provides this structure.

**Impact**: Future sessions will maintain cleaner architecture - no more misplaced information causing file bloat.

**User Insights Captured This Session**:
- Violence contexts framework (4 types: Monkey Dance, Predatory, Sport, War)
- Meta-concepts about file organization (README, help/, scripts/, syllabus/, etc.)
- Clear distinction: behavioral instructions vs. conceptual knowledge vs. technical instruction
