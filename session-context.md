## Current Status

**System Restructure: Blog ‚Üí Educational Article Series** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

Successfully converted project from blog-focused to educational article series designed for book publication. Focus on comprehensive depth, progressive learning, and self-consistency rather than engagement and standalone posts.

**Completed This Session**:
- ‚úÖ Loaded previous session state via `/resume`
- ‚úÖ Updated decisions.md: Added educational article series best practices
- ‚úÖ Updated decisions.md: Added progressive series structure and comprehensive depth principles
- ‚úÖ Updated OVERVIEW.md (.claude/CLAUDE.md): Changed all blog references to articles
- ‚úÖ Updated session-context.md: Reflect article series focus
- ‚úÖ Updated blog/ directory guidelines (renamed to article-*)
- ‚úÖ Updated command documentation for article workflow (discuss, extract, review-aikido)
- ‚úÖ Created articles/ directory structure with README
- ‚úÖ Added blog/ README clarifying legacy directory name
- ‚úÖ Verified topics.md already uses article series structure

**Analysis Complete**: 5 of 6 channels
1. **Hein's Approach** - 224 transcripts - Modern systematic positional framework
2. **Tony Sargeant** - 456 transcripts - Traditional Iwama with brutal honesty
3. **Alexander Gent** - 85 transcripts - Bridge between traditional and alive training
4. **Matthieu Jeandel** - 3 transcripts - Limited (insufficient data)
5. **SenshinOne** - 1,124 transcripts - Deep internal/philosophical approach ‚≠ê **NEW**
6. **Guillaume Erard** - 91 transcripts - Not recommended for analysis (demo videos only)

**Total Research Base**:
- 1,983 transcript files across all channels
- 60+ article ideas ready for writing
- 5 distinct teaching philosophies documented
- Cross-reference opportunities identified

## Recent Work (This Session)

### Multi-Channel Synthesis Creation

**Trigger**: User selected Option 1 (Multi-Channel Synthesis) after session resume.

**Analysis Results**:
- **5 universal agreements** identified (ALL 4 channels agree)
  1. Weapons training is foundational, not supplementary
  2. Modern Aikido has serious effectiveness problems
  3. Training quality matters more than quantity
  4. Traditional forms encode tactical/biomechanical logic
  5. Training purpose varies validly across contexts

- **4 productive contrasts** mapped (different perspectives)
  1. Aiki definitions: Adhesion (S) vs. Timing (H) vs. Kokyu (T) vs. Flow (A)
  2. Training purpose: Survival (H) vs. Spiritual (S) vs. Traditional (T) vs. Both/and (A)
  3. Internal vs. External emphasis: Cultivation (T, S) vs. Tactics (H) vs. Bridge (A)
  4. Technique framing: Finite system (H) vs. Shapes to transcend (T, S) vs. Progression (A)

- **Unique contributions** documented for each instructor
- **Research strengths and gaps** assessed
- **Citation framework** created for article writing

**Files Created**:
1. `sources/youtube/findings/2025-10-31-multi-channel-synthesis.md` (32KB comprehensive synthesis)
2. `sources/youtube/blog-ideas-multi-source.md` (15KB quick reference with citations)

**Key Insight**: Apparent disagreements among instructors often reflect different emphases rather than true contradictions. Universal agreements provide strongest validation for article claims; productive contrasts enable rich dialogue.

**Git Commit**: 06dcd05 (synthesis files committed, though commit message incorrectly referenced biomechanics)

## Next Steps

### Ready to Begin Article Writing! üéØ

**System Status**: Restructure complete - all infrastructure ready for educational article series

**Your Options**:

**Option A: Plan Article Series**
- Review `blog/article-series-structure.md` for 10 pre-planned series
- Choose first series to write (recommended: Biomechanics Foundations or Peace & Violence)
- Outline specific articles within series
- Update `topics.md` with chosen series plan

**Option B: Start Writing First Article**
- Use `/discuss [topic]` to explore article idea through conversation
- Use `/extract` to transform discussion into article draft
- Develop and expand draft in `articles/` directory
- Use `/review-aikido` for critical quality review before finalizing

**Option C: Capture Iwama Syllabus**
- Begin documenting detailed Iwama syllabus as article series
- "How to perform" instructions for techniques, weapons kata, etc.
- This could become comprehensive technical reference series

**Recommendation**: Start with `/discuss` on a topic from Peace & Violence series - leverages your unique veteran perspective and personal experiences.
