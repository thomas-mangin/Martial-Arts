## Current Status

**Knowledge Capture Session Complete** ‚úÖ

Added 9 new biomechanical principles and 1 stance principle based on user's training knowledge. System maintenance audit confirmed excellent system health after reorganization.

**Completed This Session**:
- ‚úÖ Reorganization execution (4 phases)
- ‚úÖ System maintenance audit (excellent health üü¢)
- ‚úÖ Added 7 biomechanical principles: Structural Positioning (26-30), Selective Engagement (31-32)
- ‚úÖ Added back-loaded stance to stance principles
- ‚úÖ Total: 32 biomechanical principles, 90+ blog ideas

**Knowledge Added**:
- Unbendable arm, centerline positioning, vertical movement priority
- Elbow structure, hip-driven lateral movement
- Differential muscle engagement (grip strong, joints relaxed)
- Core engagement & internal pressure (with health warnings)
- Back-loaded stance (ken, jo, Xin Yi, karate connections)

**File Status**:
- biomechanical-principles.md: 1,796 lines (approaching 2,000 threshold)
- stance-principles.md: 343 lines (significant development)

**Background**:
- Information routing system created (Session 1)
- Reorganization executed (Session 2)
- Knowledge capture and validation (Session 3 - this session)

## Recent Work (This Session)

### Comprehensive Document Audit & Reorganization Planning

**Trigger**: User requested audit of all documents against routing rules and evaluation of research/ structure

**Audit Process**:
1. **Reviewed all root-level files** (8 markdown files)
2. **Analyzed research/ directory** (13 files, 6,321 total lines)
3. **Identified overlaps and misplacements**
4. **Evaluated file sizes** (biomechanical-principles.md = 1,293 lines)

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ Most files correctly routed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Overlap between decisions.md and core-values.md (behavioral guidance vs beliefs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è research.md duplicates research/INDEX.md
- ‚ö†Ô∏è biomechanical-principles.md very large (needs splitting)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No dedicated space for analysis findings (video/blog summaries)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SYSTEM_REVIEW.md needs routing

**User Directives Received**:
- Break down decisions.md into categories
- Move core-values content into appropriate decision categories
- Create findings/ for video/blog analysis summaries
- Route SYSTEM_REVIEW content (create new rules if needed)
- Split biomechanics into logical subdirectory
- Consolidate research indexes (use INDEX.md, delete research.md)
- Move "how to write" guidance to blog/

**Reorganization Plan Created**:
- **8 phases** covering all reorganization work
- **decisions-NEW.md** created with 6 categories:
  1. Foundational Values (beliefs about martial arts)
  2. Writing Style (how to write blog posts)
  3. Content Strategy (audience, topics)
  4. Content Quality (review standards)
  5. System Architecture (technical organization)
  6. Session Management (git, workflow)
- **Timeline**: 2-3 sessions with checkpoints
- **Files**: 7 new, 4 moved, 7 updated, 5 deleted

**Deliverables**:
- `REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md` - Complete execution plan
- `decisions-NEW.md` - New categorized structure (awaiting approval)

## Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE: User Review & Approval

**Review REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md**:
- Approve 6-category decisions.md structure?
- Approve findings/ directory creation?
- Approve biomechanics/ split now or defer?
- Approve timeline (2-3 sessions)?

**Review decisions-NEW.md**:
- Check categorization makes sense
- Verify all behavioral decisions captured
- Confirm values properly separated from style guidance

**Answer 5 Questions**:
1. Approve the 6 categories (Values, Style, Strategy, Quality, Architecture, Management)?
2. Delete core-values.md entirely or keep as pointer?
3. findings/ at top-level or under sources/?
4. Split biomechanics/ now or defer?
5. Timeline: all in next session or split across 2-3?

### AFTER APPROVAL: Execute Reorganization

**Session 2** (Next):
- Phase 1: Replace decisions.md with categorized version
- Phase 6: Consolidate research indexes
- Phase 4: Route SYSTEM_REVIEW.md
- Phase 7: Create blog-voice-guide.md

**Session 3** (Later):
- Phase 3: Create findings/ directory
- Phase 5: Split biomechanics/ (if approved)
- Phase 8: Update routing guide

### ALSO PENDING:

**Workspace Cleanup**: 150+ transcript files in sources/youtube/transcripts/ need organization

## Blockers/Questions

**None currently**

## Notes

**Session Focus**: Information architecture improvement triggered by user feedback

**Key Learning**: When user shares information, the system must have clear rules for where to store it. The routing guide now provides this structure.

**Impact**: Future sessions will maintain cleaner architecture - no more misplaced information causing file bloat.

**User Insights Captured This Session**:
- Violence contexts framework (4 types: Monkey Dance, Predatory, Sport, War)
- Meta-concepts about file organization (README, help/, scripts/, syllabus/, etc.)
- Clear distinction: behavioral instructions vs. conceptual knowledge vs. technical instruction
