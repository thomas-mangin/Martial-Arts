# Session Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

## Current Status
<!-- What you're currently working on -->
**Data Gathering Phase** - Comprehensive biomechanics framework complete (23 principles, 10 blog series). Now identifying areas needing deeper exploration through /discuss before writing blogs.

## Recent Work
<!-- What was accomplished in the last session -->
- **AUTHENTICITY SYSTEM**: Created comprehensive framework for authentic voice
- Created **core-values.md** - Fundamental beliefs as martial artist:
  - Teaching philosophy (biomechanics over mysticism)
  - Knowing vs. Embodied mastery framework
  - Physical progression (5 stages: hands→feet→timing→core→patterns)
  - Iwama approach (structure good, relaxation often missing)
  - **Background section**: Military service (les chasseurs), knife attack defense, veteran observations
  - **Critical insight**: Veterans avoid conflict; fantasists seek it
  - **Honest positioning**: First dan, not great fighter, values honesty over ego
- Created **divisive-topics.md** - 8 major martial arts debates:
  - Aikido-specific: Peace vs. martial, Iwama vs. blending, Ki vs. biomechanics
  - General: Kata vs. alive training, traditional vs. modern, competition
  - Cross-discipline: Hard vs. soft, weapons vs. empty hand
  - **Filled in peace vs. martial stance**: Both/and, peace through understanding cost
- Created **learning-journey.md** - Comprehensive mastery framework:
  - Knowing (intellectual) vs. Embodied (natural movement)
  - **Physical progression detail**: 5 stages with characteristics, teaching focus, signs of progress
  - Stage 4 is the critical shift: hands move body → core moves hands
  - **Pattern recognition**: Same principle, different applications (taking balance example)
  - Kinetic energy transfer: body → arm → hand (difficulty increases with joints)
  - Kata as alphabet concept: Forms are foundation, not scripture
  - 18+ blog post ideas generated from frameworks
- Created **biomechanical-principles.md** - **23 core principles** documented:
  - Foundation mechanics (1-10): Leverage, gravity, balance, Newton's laws, kinetic chain, alignment, snap movement
  - Application mechanics (11-17): Surface area, targets, deflection, natural walking, foot mechanics, directional vulnerability
  - Advanced concepts (18-23): Tension/relaxation, upward redirection, joint vulnerability, deflect before lock, weapons assumption, remove expected resistance
  - Each principle includes: explanation, aikido applications, teaching implications, blog topics
  - Quick reference guide at top for all 23 principles
  - **60+ blog topics generated** from biomechanical analysis
- Created **blog-series-structure.md** - 10 progressive learning series:
  - Series 1: Biomechanics Foundations (6 posts)
  - Series 2: The Learning Journey (5 posts)
  - Series 3: Kata Philosophy (4 posts)
  - Series 4: Peace and Violence (5 posts)
  - Series 5: Deflection and Angles (4 posts)
  - Series 6: The Iwama Question (4 posts)
  - Series 7: Movement Mechanics (5 posts)
  - Series 8: Teaching Aikido (5 posts)
  - Series 9: Cross-Discipline Insights (5 posts)
  - Series 10: Solo Training (4 posts)
  - **50+ posts organized** into progressive reader paths
- Created **SESSION-SUMMARY-BIOMECHANICS.md** - Comprehensive overview for easy reference
- Created **areas-needing-development.md** - Topics requiring /discuss before blog writing:
  - **High priority**: Weapons training develops biomechanics, Aikido sword = Wing Chun hands, circle principle
  - 10+ topics identified with gaps, questions for /discuss, blog potential
  - Ready-to-write topics also identified (sufficient material exists)
- **UPDATED COMMANDS**: Integrated authenticity system
  - /discuss: Checks core values before starting discussion
  - /review-aikido: Checks value alignment, divisive topic handling, authenticity
- **UPDATED GUIDELINES**:
  - blog-guidelines.md: Added "Authenticity: Writing from Your Core Values" section
  - blog-guidelines.md: Added "Your Voice & Perspective" with first-dan framing
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md: Documented "Authenticity & Philosophical Grounding System"
- **DECISIONS LOGGED**:
  - Honest positioning as first dan (Stages 1-3 experience, Stage 4 emerging, Stage 5 observation)
  - Background context (military, knife attack, veteran observations)
  - Peace vs. martial stance: Both/and, peace through strength

## Next Steps
<!-- What to do next -->
1. **Continue Data Gathering** - Priority /discuss sessions (see areas-needing-development.md):
   - `/discuss` **Weapons Training Develops Biomechanics** - How ken/jo builds martial principles (foundational to many series)
   - `/discuss` **Aikido Sword = Wing Chun Hands** - Cross-discipline structural insight (high value, unique observation)
   - `/discuss` **Circle Principle** - Widely misunderstood, needs clarification before writing
   - `/discuss` **No Defense Only Attack on Attack** - Timing principle that resolves peace vs. martial
   - `/discuss` **Taking Balance** - Reading balance, continuous kuzushi, connection to circles

2. **70+ Blog Ideas Available** (but many need depth first):
   - 10 from source scans (blogs)
   - 5 from YouTube analysis
   - 18+ from learning-journey.md frameworks
   - 60+ from biomechanical-principles.md
   - **Organized into 10 progressive series** (see blog-series-structure.md)

3. **Some Topics Ready to Write** (sufficient material exists):
   - Newton's Third Law in Aikido (Principle #7)
   - The Kinetic Chain (Principle #8)
   - Those Who've Faced Violence vs. Those Who Imagine It (core-values.md, veteran observations)
   - Knowing vs. Embodied Understanding (learning-journey.md)
   - Kata as Alphabet (learning-journey.md)

4. **After /discuss Sessions**:
   - Capture insights in discussions/ directory
   - Update areas-needing-development.md when topics are sufficiently developed
   - Then ready to write blog posts with depth

## Blockers/Questions
<!-- Anything that needs decision or is blocking progress -->
None - system is complete and ready

## Notes
<!-- Any other context that would be helpful -->
- **Complete System Built**: 23 principles, 10 series, 70+ blog ideas, authentic voice framework
- **Current Phase**: Data gathering - identifying what needs deeper exploration before writing
- **5 Priority /discuss Topics** tracked in todos and areas-needing-development.md
- **Your voice grounded in**: Technical understanding + military background + real pressure experience + veteran observations + first-dan honesty
- **Unique observations to explore**:
  - Weapons training develops biomechanics (how?)
  - Aikido sword = Wing Chun hands (structural parallel)
  - Circle principle widely misunderstood (what's the real mechanics?)
- **Honest assessment**: Aikido assumes weapons, different context than sport fighting
- See SESSION-SUMMARY-BIOMECHANICS.md for comprehensive overview
- Git commits automatically pushed to GitHub
- Use /checkpoint before ending session, /resume when starting next
