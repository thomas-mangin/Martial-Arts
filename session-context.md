# Session Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

## Current Status
<!-- What you're currently working on -->
Authenticity and philosophical grounding system complete - ready to start writing with authentic first-dan voice grounded in real experience

## Recent Work
<!-- What was accomplished in the last session -->
- **AUTHENTICITY SYSTEM**: Created comprehensive framework for authentic voice
- Created **core-values.md** - Fundamental beliefs as martial artist:
  - Teaching philosophy (biomechanics over mysticism)
  - Knowing vs. Embodied mastery framework
  - Physical progression (5 stages: hands→feet→timing→core→patterns)
  - Iwama approach (structure good, relaxation often missing)
  - **Background section**: Military service (les chasseurs), knife attack defense, veteran observations
  - **Critical insight**: Veterans avoid conflict; fantasists seek it
  - **Honest positioning**: First dan, not great fighter, values honesty over ego
- Created **divisive-topics.md** - 8 major martial arts debates:
  - Aikido-specific: Peace vs. martial, Iwama vs. blending, Ki vs. biomechanics
  - General: Kata vs. alive training, traditional vs. modern, competition
  - Cross-discipline: Hard vs. soft, weapons vs. empty hand
  - **Filled in peace vs. martial stance**: Both/and, peace through understanding cost
- Created **learning-journey.md** - Comprehensive mastery framework:
  - Knowing (intellectual) vs. Embodied (natural movement)
  - **Physical progression detail**: 5 stages with characteristics, teaching focus, signs of progress
  - Stage 4 is the critical shift: hands move body → core moves hands
  - **Pattern recognition**: Same principle, different applications (taking balance example)
  - Kinetic energy transfer: body → arm → hand (difficulty increases with joints)
  - Kata as alphabet concept: Forms are foundation, not scripture
  - 18+ blog post ideas generated from frameworks
- Created **biomechanical-principles.md** - 6 core principles to integrate:
  - Leverage (distance from pivot multiplies strength)
  - Gravity as power source/demultiplicator
  - Two-foot balance problem (three-point stability math)
  - Taking balance: direction of missing leg
  - Balance on contact, never give back
  - **No defense, only attack on attack** (timing and reading intention)
  - 11+ blog topics generated
- **UPDATED COMMANDS**: Integrated authenticity system
  - /discuss: Checks core values before starting discussion
  - /review-aikido: Checks value alignment, divisive topic handling, authenticity
- **UPDATED GUIDELINES**:
  - blog-guidelines.md: Added "Authenticity: Writing from Your Core Values" section
  - blog-guidelines.md: Added "Your Voice & Perspective" with first-dan framing
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md: Documented "Authenticity & Philosophical Grounding System"
- **DECISIONS LOGGED**:
  - Honest positioning as first dan (Stages 1-3 experience, Stage 4 emerging, Stage 5 observation)
  - Background context (military, knife attack, veteran observations)
  - Peace vs. martial stance: Both/and, peace through strength

## Next Steps
<!-- What to do next -->
1. **Ready to Write First Blog Post** with complete authentic voice framework:
   - 40+ blog ideas available (10 from sources, 5 from YouTube, 18+ from learning-journey, 11+ from biomechanics)
   - Use first-dan perspective framing ("In my experience...", "What I've observed...")
   - Reference core values for consistency
   - Check divisive-topics.md if writing about controversies
   - Apply learning-journey frameworks when discussing mastery/progression

2. **High-Priority Topics** that use your unique voice:
   - "Why Combat Veterans Value Peace: Lessons for Aikido" (your veteran observations)
   - "From Hands to Hips: The Hidden Progression of Aikido Mastery" (physical progression)
   - "There Is No Defense in Aikido: Attack the Attack" (biomechanics + philosophy)
   - "The Gap Between Training and Reality: What Matters Under Pressure" (knife attack experience)
   - "Your Kata Is an Alphabet, Not a Bible" (kata concept)

3. **Writing Approach Options**:
   - **A. Discussion-Based**: `/discuss [topic]` → `/extract` → develop (checks core values automatically)
   - **B. Direct Writing**: Use core-values.md + learning-journey.md + biomechanical-principles.md
   - **C. Add to Topics**: Update topics.md with prioritized ideas

4. **System Usage**:
   - Reference core-values.md before writing to ensure consistency
   - Check divisive-topics.md when writing about controversial subjects
   - Use learning-journey.md frameworks for progression/mastery topics
   - Use biomechanical-principles.md for technical explanations
   - /review-aikido will check value alignment and authenticity

## Blockers/Questions
<!-- Anything that needs decision or is blocking progress -->
None - system is complete and ready

## Notes
<!-- Any other context that would be helpful -->
- **Your voice is now grounded in**: Technical understanding + military background + real pressure experience + veteran observations + first-dan honesty
- **Peace through understanding cost**: Not weakness, but earned through witnessing trauma
- **Honesty as strength**: Not great fighter, still learning, but has faced real situations
- **Unique perspective**: Technical analyst + pressure-tested + military discipline + trauma witness
- **40+ blog ideas** across all frameworks ready to write
- **All commands updated** to reference core values and authenticity system
- Git commits automatically pushed to GitHub
- Use /checkpoint before ending session, /resume when starting next
