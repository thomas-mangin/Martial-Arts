## Current Status

**Slash Commands Now Syllabus-Aware**: All blog writing and review commands (`/review-aikido`, `/discuss`, and blog guidelines) now integrate with the enhanced syllabus system. Commands automatically reference comprehensive dictionary, complete kata sequences, and technical documentation.

**System Architecture**:
- `/syllabus/` = Factual information (techniques, terminology, requirements, kata sequences) ✓ COMPLETE
- `/research/` = Interpretation and analysis (frameworks, principles) ✓ VALIDATED
- **Slash commands** = Now leverage syllabus for technical accuracy ✓ INTEGRATED
- Clear separation maintains integrity throughout workflow

**Key Achievement**: Complete integration of syllabus into writing/review workflow. Blog posts will now have automatic technical accuracy checking and terminology verification.

**Ready for**: Start writing first blog post with full syllabus support, OR continue expanding syllabus content with user's personal practice insights.

  - Terminology section now references `/syllabus/terminology.md` (100+ term dictionary)
  - Technical accuracy section verifies against all syllabus files
  - Kata sequence verification for weapons content
  - Rank-appropriateness checks
  - Updated Critical Standards Checklist with syllabus verification

- **`.claude/commands/discuss.md`**: Added syllabus to context checking
  - References terminology, techniques, kata sequences during discussion
  - Grounds discussions in documented facts before interpretation
  - Added syllabus reference fields to discussion note template

- **`blog/blog-guidelines.md`**: Added comprehensive verification section

**Impact**:
- All commands now leverage 100+ term dictionary automatically
- Complete kata sequences (31 jo, 13 jo) accessible during writing/review
- Technical accuracy grounded in documented syllabus files
- Blog posts will have higher technical accuracy from the start
- Clear separation between factual reference and interpretation

### 2. Previous Session Work (Website Analysis & Integration)
**Objective**: Extract missing syllabus information from takemusu-iwama-aikido.org and related sources

**Sources Analyzed**:
- **Takemusu Iwama Aikido Website** (https://takemusu-iwama-aikido.org/)
  - Comprehensive Aikido Dictionary page
  - Kata structure pages (video-focused, limited written details)
- **AikidoFAQ.com** (via alternative sources due to SSL certificate expiry)
  - 31 Jo Kata details via Yumpu.com
  - 13 Jo Kata details via Budo Inochi website
  - Kumitachi references

**Key Finding**: Existing syllabus system is MORE comprehensive than public websites for written reference. Websites are primarily video libraries with limited written documentation.

### 4. System Validation
**Discovery**: Public online resources (takemusu-iwama-aikido.org, aikidofaq.com) are:
- **Video-focused**: Most content is embedded videos (Saito Sensei, Tony Sargeant)
- **Limited written detail**: General information, not detailed movement sequences
- **Reference libraries**: Good for overview, not comprehensive written syllabus

**Your Syllabus Advantages**:
- Progressive rank requirements documented in detail
- "Known unknowns" tracking system
- Cross-references to research frameworks
- Integration with video analysis (Tony Sargeant, Alexander Gent)
- Personal notes from first-dan perspective
- Complete kata sequences in written form

## Notes

**Session Significance**: Completed full workflow integration. The syllabus system (enhanced in previous session) is now integrated into all slash commands. This creates a seamless workflow where technical accuracy is automatically verified during writing and review.

**Key Achievement**: Made `/review-aikido`, `/discuss`, and blog guidelines syllabus-aware. Commands now automatically reference 100+ term dictionary, complete kata sequences, and technical documentation without manual lookup.

**Workflow Integration**:
- **Before**: Syllabus existed but required manual reference during writing
- **After**: Slash commands automatically leverage syllabus for accuracy checking
- **Result**: Technical accuracy built into workflow, not added as afterthought

**System Completeness**:
- ✓ Syllabus: Comprehensive factual reference (terminology, techniques, kata, ranks)
- ✓ Research: Validated frameworks and analysis
- ✓ Commands: Integrated with syllabus for automatic verification
- ✓ Guidelines: Clear instructions for using syllabus during writing

**System Philosophy**: Separation of facts (syllabus) from interpretation (research) is now enforced by the workflow itself. Commands ground discussions in facts before exploring interpretation.

**Ready to Write**: All infrastructure complete. Next session should start actual blog writing to test the integrated workflow end-to-end.
