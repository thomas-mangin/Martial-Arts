## Current Status

**Biomechanics Reorganization Complete** ✅

Successfully split the 1,796-line biomechanical-principles.md into a well-organized directory structure with 7 thematic categories. System is now optimized for growth and navigation.

**Completed This Session**:
- ✅ Analyzed biomechanical-principles.md structure (1,796 lines)
- ✅ Created research/biomechanics/ directory with 8 files
- ✅ Split 32 principles into 7 natural thematic categories
- ✅ Created comprehensive INDEX.md with learning progression
- ✅ Updated research/INDEX.md to reflect new structure
- ✅ Archived original file (biomechanical-principles.md.archive)
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

**New Structure**:
- **01-physics-fundamentals.md** (222 lines) - 6 principles
- **02-balance-mechanics.md** (92 lines) - 3 principles
- **03-static-structure.md** (218 lines) - 5 principles
- **04-dynamic-engagement.md** (284 lines) - 4 principles
- **05-power-generation.md** (304 lines) - 5 principles
- **06-targeting-application.md** (383 lines) - 7 principles
- **07-timing-context.md** (122 lines) - 2 principles
- **INDEX.md** (181 lines) - Navigation and learning progression

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Manageable file sizes (largest is 383 lines vs. 1,796)
- Natural learning progression through categories
- Easy navigation via INDEX
- Room to grow without hitting file size limits
- All 32 principles and 90+ blog ideas preserved

## Recent Work (This Session)

### Biomechanics File Split Request

**Trigger**: User requested to split the biomechanical-principles.md file after reviewing the proposed 7-category structure.

**Categories Identified**:
1. Physics Fundamentals (6 principles) - Universal laws
2. Balance Mechanics (3 principles) - Kuzushi explained
3. Static Structure (5 principles) - Body positioning
4. Dynamic Engagement (4 principles) - Selective tension/relaxation
5. Power Generation (5 principles) - Movement and force
6. Targeting & Application (7 principles) - Where/how to apply
7. Timing & Context (2 principles) - When/why to act

**Execution Process**:
1. Created biomechanics/ directory
2. Generated INDEX.md with learning progression
3. Used Task agent to extract and organize all 32 principles
4. Each category file includes complete principle documentation
5. Updated research/INDEX.md to point to new structure
6. Archived original file for backup
7. Verified migration completeness

**Technical Details**:
- Total lines: 1,806 across 8 files (vs. 1,796 in single file)
- File size range: 92-383 lines
- All blog post ideas preserved (90+)
- All cross-references maintained
- Principle numbering preserved (#1-#32)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Options

**Option 1: Content Creation**
- Pick a topic from the 90+ blog post ideas
- Use `/discuss [topic]` to explore
- Transform discussion to blog post

**Option 2: Add More Knowledge**
- Continue gathering biomechanical principles
- Add to appropriate category file (now easier!)
- Document training insights

**Option 3: Workspace Cleanup**
- **NOTE**: 150+ YouTube transcript files in sources/youtube/transcripts/
- Need organization (mentioned in git status)
- Consider using `/system-maintenance cleanup` to address

**Option 4: Start Fresh Topic**
- Topics queue is empty - ready for new direction
- Could explore divisive-topics, learning-journey, or other research areas

## Blockers/Questions

**None currently**

The biomechanics reorganization resolved the file size issue and created a sustainable structure for future growth.

## Notes

**Session Focus**: File organization and structural optimization

**Key Achievement**: Transformed unwieldy 1,796-line file into navigable 7-category system that supports the natural learning progression from physics fundamentals through strategic application.

**Design Principle Applied**: When a file approaches 2,000 lines, split by natural thematic categories rather than arbitrary divisions. This creates both better navigation and conceptual clarity.

**Git Status Note**: The working directory shows 150+ untracked YouTube transcript files. These were present before this session and represent a separate cleanup task for future consideration.
