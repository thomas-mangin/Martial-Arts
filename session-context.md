## Current Status

**Syllabus Reference System Complete**: Created comprehensive `/syllabus/` directory with Takemusu/Iwama Aikido technical reference for ensuring accuracy in `/discuss` and `/review-aikido`.

**System Architecture**:
- `/syllabus/` = Factual information (techniques, terminology, requirements)
- `/research/` = Interpretation and analysis (frameworks, principles)
- Clear separation maintains integrity

**Ready for**: Enhanced `/discuss` sessions and `/review-aikido` with technical accuracy, OR continue blog writing with solid technical grounding.

## Recent Work (This Session)

### 1. Syllabus System Created
**Purpose**: Provide factual technical reference separate from interpretation

**Files Created**:
- `syllabus/overview.md`: Lineage, grading structure, Takemusu/Iwama philosophy
- `syllabus/terminology.md`: 180+ Japanese-English terms
- `syllabus/attacks.md`: All attack types with progressive introduction
- `syllabus/techniques/ikkyo.md`: Example pin technique (complete template)
- `syllabus/techniques/irimi-nage.md`: Example projection (complete template)
- `syllabus/README.md`: System documentation

**Key Information Documented**:
- Takemusu/Iwama lineage (Morihei Ueshiba → Saito Morihiro Sensei)
- Grading progression: Rokkyu (6th kyu) through Yondan (4th dan)
- Kihon (basic form) vs. Kinonagare (flowing form) distinction
- Progressive attack introduction by rank
- Integrated weapons (ken, jo) and empty-hand training
- School variations (Iwama vs. Aikikai, Yoshinkan, Ki Society)

### 2. Sources Processed
**PDF 1**: "Aikido Syllabus Booklet Format Idea"
- User's dojo syllabus
- Philosophy and progression overview
- Technique requirements by rank

**PDF 2**: TIAE (Takemusu Iwama Aikido Europe) 2024 Syllabus
- Official European organization syllabus
- Author: Nigel Porter (Feb 2024)
- More detailed requirements
- Important rule: Kihon only up to 3rd kyu; from 2nd kyu demonstrate both Kihon and Kinonagare
- Advanced techniques: Henkawaza (variations), Kaeshiwaza (counters), Kentaijo (ken vs jo)

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems
**For `/discuss` sessions**:
- Reference terminology.md for correct Japanese terms
- Check attacks.md for attack progression
- Use techniques/*.md for technical details
- Understand rank-appropriate content

**For `/review-aikido` quality checks**:
- Verify Japanese spelling and macrons
- Check technical accuracy against technique files
- Ensure audience appropriateness matches rank progression
- Confirm Iwama-specific details

**For Blog Writing**:
- Determine appropriate techniques for target audience
- Use correct terminology
- Note school-specific variations
- Apply progressive learning expectations

### 4. System Design Principles
**Factual vs. Interpretive Separation**:
- Syllabus: "Ikkyo is taught at Rokkyu" (fact)
- Research: "Why ikkyo is pedagogically first" (interpretation)

**Scalability**:
- Template established for adding more techniques
- One file per technique for easy reference
- Can add rank files as needed
- Video evidence integration ready (Tony Sargeant, Alexander Gent clips)

**Cross-References**:
- Links to biomechanical-principles.md
- Connections to learning-journey.md
- Framework integration without mixing fact and analysis

## Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE (System Integration):

**Option A: Enhance Slash Commands** (RECOMMENDED)
- Update `/.claude/commands/review-aikido.md`:
  - Add step: "Check Japanese terminology against /syllabus/terminology.md"
  - Add step: "Verify technical descriptions against /syllabus/techniques/"
  - Add step: "Confirm audience level matches /syllabus/overview.md ranks"
- Update `/.claude/commands/discuss.md`:
  - Add reference to /syllabus/ for technical accuracy
  - Note rank-appropriate expectations
- Update `blog/blog-guidelines.md`:
  - Add section on using /syllabus/ for technical verification

**Option B: Expand Syllabus Content**
- Add more technique files (nikyo, sankyo, yonkyo, shiho-nage, kote-gaeshi, etc.)
- Create rank-specific files (ranks/*.md) with exact requirements
- Add weapons details (weapons/ken/*.md, weapons/jo/*.md)
- Document TIAE-specific requirements

**Option C: Start Blog Writing**
- Use syllabus system for technical accuracy
- Write first post with solid grounding
- Test integration of syllabus during review process

### CONTINUING WORK:

**Two Major Threads**:
1. **Data Gathering**: 541 videos analyzed (Tony + Alexander) with 40+ blog ideas
2. **Technical Foundation**: Syllabus system now provides accuracy check

**Recommended Approach**: Integrate syllabus into slash commands (Option A), then resume blog writing with enhanced technical accuracy.

## Blockers/Questions

**None** - System is functional and ready for integration

**Note**: Context usage reached 88% (176k/200k tokens) during this session, indicating comprehensive syllabus work. Good checkpoint timing.

## Key Files for Next Session

**Syllabus System (NEW)**:
- syllabus/README.md - System overview
- syllabus/overview.md - Grading and lineage
- syllabus/terminology.md - Quick reference
- syllabus/attacks.md - Attack types
- syllabus/techniques/*.md - Technique files (ikkyo, irimi-nage so far)

**YouTube Evidence Base**:
- sources/youtube/findings/2025-10-30-complete-channel-analysis-456-videos.md (Tony Sargeant)
- sources/youtube/findings/2025-10-30-alexander-gent-complete-channel-analysis.md (Alexander Gent)

**Research Frameworks** (All Validated):
- research/core-values.md
- research/divisive-topics.md
- research/learning-journey.md
- research/weapons-training-framework.md
- research/teaching-transmission-gap.md
- research/biomechanical-principles.md

**Slash Commands** (To Be Updated):
- .claude/commands/review-aikido.md - Needs syllabus integration
- .claude/commands/discuss.md - Needs syllabus reference

## Notes

**Session Significance**: Created foundational technical reference system that ensures accuracy in all future blog writing, discussions, and reviews. This separates facts (syllabus) from interpretation (research), maintaining intellectual integrity.

**System Philosophy**: The `/syllabus/` system embodies the principle that technical accuracy must come from documented sources (PDFs from dojo/TIAE), not interpretation. This grounds all blog content in verifiable facts.

**Scalability**: Template-based system allows incremental expansion. Don't need to document every technique immediately—add as blog topics require them.

**Integration Value**: When `/discuss` and `/review-aikido` reference `/syllabus/`, blog posts will be technically accurate from the start, reducing revision cycles and increasing quality.

**First-Dan Perspective**: Personal notes in technique files acknowledge writing from first-dan perspective, maintaining authenticity established in core-values.md.
