## Priority Topics for /discuss Sessions

### 1. Weapons Training Develops Biomechanics ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State**:
- core-values.md mentions Iwama uses ken/jo to build strong core

**What's Missing**:
- How does sword training (ken) teach body mechanics?
- What biomechanical principles does jo (staff) develop?
- Why is weapons training more effective than empty hand for certain foundations?
- Which specific principles (of the 23) are best learned through weapons?
- Connection between weapons structure and empty-hand application

**Questions for /discuss**:
- How does holding a weapon change body mechanics and awareness?
- What does ken teach about center line, structure, and power generation?
- What does jo teach about leverage, distance, and connection?
- Why can't empty hand training alone achieve what weapons training does?

**Blog Potential**:

## How to Use This File

**Before Writing Any Blog Post**:
1. Check if topic is in "Areas Needing Development" section
2. If yes: Run `/discuss [topic]` first to gather depth
3. If in "Ready to Write": Sufficient material exists, can draft directly

**During Data Gathering**:
- Use `/discuss` for each high-priority topic
- Capture insights in discussions/ directory
- Update this file when topic is sufficiently developed
- Move developed topics to "Ready to Write" section

**Tracking Progress**:
- Use TodoWrite to track which topics have been discussed
- Mark topics complete when sufficient depth achieved
- Update this file as new gaps are identified

---

## Next Steps

**Recommended /discuss sequence:**
1. Weapons training develops biomechanics (foundational to many series)
2. Aikido sword = Wing Chun hands (cross-discipline insight)
3. Circle principle (widely misunderstood, high value)
4. No defense, only attack on attack (resolves peace vs. martial)
5. Taking balance depth (practical application)

After these 5 sessions, reassess what else needs development.
