## Key Principles

### 1. Quality Over Quantity
- Don't rush posts for volume
- MA-level standards maintained
- Technical accuracy verified via syllabus
- Authentic voice preserved

### 2. Strategic, Not Comprehensive
- Syllabus grows as blog requires, not completeness goals
- Video analysis focused on high-value series, not exhaustive coverage
- /discuss topics prioritized by blog potential
- Add what's needed, not everything possible

### 3. Workflow Over Infrastructure
- Writing blog posts is primary activity
- Infrastructure serves writing, not vice versa
- Test in practice, refine based on real usage
- Don't let planning replace doing

### 4. Authenticity Over Generic
- Personal insights make content valuable
- First-dan perspective is strength, not weakness
- Biomechanical approach is differentiator
- User's unique voice is the product

---

## Next Session Recommendation

**Recommended Action**: Write first blog post

**Steps**:
1. Review blog-series-structure.md or topics.md
2. Choose a topic you're excited about
3. Use /discuss if needed to explore
4. Draft using blog/blog-template.md
5. Run /review-aikido for technical accuracy
6. Revise and complete
7. Document lessons learned for workflow refinement

**Don't wait for "perfect" - the system is ready. Start writing!**
