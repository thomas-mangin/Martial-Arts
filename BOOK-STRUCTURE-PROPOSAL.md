# Educational Article Series → Book Structure

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Purpose**: Restructure from blog-focused content to educational article series that could be published as a comprehensive book on Aikido

---

## Vision

Create a **comprehensive, self-consistent educational resource** that:
- Progresses logically from foundations to advanced concepts
- Integrates biomechanical understanding with traditional Iwama teaching
- Provides detailed "how to" guidance for Iwama syllabus techniques
- Could be published as a complete book or used as modular educational articles
- Focuses on **educational value** over catchy hooks
- Serves as both learning resource and reference manual

1. **Expanded** with detailed "how to perform" instructions
2. **Integrated** into Part IV (Chapters 8-12)
3. **Referenced** throughout other chapters for technical accuracy
4. **Maintained** as both standalone reference AND book chapters

**Research Content** (`/research/`) will be:
1. **Source material** for article writing (not published directly)
2. **Referenced** for frameworks and principles
3. **Cited** for supporting arguments

**YouTube/Source Analysis** (`/sources/`) will be:
1. **Evidence base** for multi-source validation
2. **Quote sources** for supporting points
3. **Not published** as-is, but mined for insights

## Writing Approach

### Educational Focus

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Clear explanations** over catchy hooks
- ✅ **Progressive difficulty** - foundations before advanced concepts
- ✅ **Self-consistent** - later chapters reference earlier ones
- ✅ **Comprehensive** - cover topic thoroughly, not just highlights
- ✅ **Practical guidance** - readers can apply what they learn
- ✅ **Multi-source validation** - cite evidence from multiple instructors

**Not**:
- ❌ Clickbait titles ("This One Weird Trick...")
- ❌ Controversial hot takes for engagement
- ❌ Incomplete coverage that requires seeking other sources
- ❌ Inconsistent frameworks between articles

### Article Titles

**Blog Style** (Old):
- "Why Your Aikido Teacher Won't Shut Up About Sword Training"
- "Four Aikido Masters Answer: 'Does Aikido Work?'"

**Educational Style** (New):
- "The Role of Weapons Training in Aikido Development"
- "Aikido Effectiveness: Context, Limitations, and Honest Assessment"

**For Iwama Syllabus** (Part IV):
- "Ikkyo: Biomechanics, Variations, and Progressive Training"
- "The Seven Ken Suburi: Detailed Technical Breakdown"
- "Jo Kata and Kumijo: From Solo Practice to Partner Training"

### Voice and Tone

Maintain **first dan perspective** (established in decisions.md):
- Speak from direct experience (Stages 1-3)
- Acknowledge emerging understanding (Stage 4)
- Cite observation for advanced mastery (Stage 5)
- Professional but personal
- Honest about limitations

## Workflow Changes

### Commands Update

**Current**: `/discuss` → `/extract` → `/review-aikido`

**Updated for book**:
1. `/discuss [topic]` - Still useful for exploring ideas
2. `/extract [discussion]` - Transform to article draft (not blog draft)
3. `/review-article [file]` - NEW: Review for educational completeness and consistency
   - Check: Does it build on previous chapters?
   - Check: Is it self-consistent with established frameworks?
   - Check: Is it thorough enough for standalone book chapter?
   - Check: Does it reference syllabus accurately?

### Topics Management

**Current**: `topics.md` organized as blog topic queue

**Updated**: `book-progress.md` tracks:
- Which chapters are complete
- Which articles within chapters are drafted/finished
- Overall book completion percentage
- Next articles to write (in chapter order)

### Session Context

**Current**: Focused on blog writing progress

**Updated**: Tracks:
- Current chapter/article being worked on
- Book completion status
- Integration with syllabus content
- Cross-references between chapters

## Integration with Iwama Syllabus

### Part IV Structure (Detailed)

**Chapter 8: Syllabus Overview** (Educational Introduction)
- Article 1: Understanding the Iwama/Takemusu Progression
- Article 2: Grading Structure and Philosophy
- Article 3: Attack Types and Progressive Introduction
- Article 4: Training Sections and Their Purpose

**Chapter 9: Fundamental Techniques** (How-To Reference)

*Each technique gets comprehensive coverage*:

Example - **Ikkyo**:
- Japanese terminology and translation
- Category and purpose
- Biomechanical principles (leverage, structure, connection)
- Variations by direction (omote/ura)
- Variations by attack (shomenuchi, yokomenuchi, katatedori, etc.)
- Variations by position (tachiwaza, suwariwaza, hanmihandachi)
- Step-by-step execution (with photos/diagrams if possible)
- Common errors by skill level
- Learning progression and what to focus on
- Teaching notes
- Video references (Tony Sargeant, Alexander Gent, etc.)

Techniques to cover:
- Pins: Ikkyo, Nikyo, Sankyo, Yonkyo, Gokyo, Rokkyo
- Projections: Shiho-nage, Irimi-nage, Kote-gaeshi, Kaiten-nage, Tenchi-nage, Koshi-nage, Kokyu-nage
- Others as needed

**Chapter 10: Weapons Training** (How-To Reference)

*Detailed technical breakdowns*:

**Section 1: Aikiken (Sword)**
- 7 Ken Suburi (solo cutting practice)
  - Each suburi: stance, grip, cutting angle, hip movement, common errors
- Ki Musubi no Tachi (5 kumitachi)
- Kumitachi forms (paired sword practice)
- Connection to taijutsu principles

**Section 2: Aikijo (Staff)**
- 20 Jo Suburi (solo practice)
  - Each suburi: grip, stance, striking/thrusting mechanics
- 13 Jo Kata (complete sequence)
- 31 Jo Kata (complete sequence)
- 6 Jo Kata (Roku no Jo)
- 10 Kumijo (paired jo)
- 31 Kumijo (paired jo)
- Kata and anti-kata concept
- Connection to taijutsu principles

**Section 3: Ken Tai Jo**
- Sword vs. staff integrated practice
- All forms and their tactical principles

**Chapter 11: Weapons Taking** (Bukidori)
- Tachidori techniques with applications
- Tantodori techniques with applications
- Jodori and Jonage techniques

**Chapter 12: Progressive Training**
- Rokkyu through Ikkyu requirements
- Focus for each rank
- Common challenges at each stage
- Shodan and beyond expectations

### Syllabus Content Development

**Current State**: `/syllabus/` has good foundation with:
- Overview, terminology, attacks documented ✅
- 4 techniques partially detailed ✅
- Weapons suburi documented ✅
- Kata/kumijo placeholder files ✅

**Needed for Book**:
1. **Complete all technique files** with full detail
2. **Expand weapons kata** with step-by-step sequences
3. **Add rank-specific files** for progressive requirements
4. **Create comprehensive how-to** for each syllabus component
5. **Add diagrams/photos** where helpful (future enhancement)

**User's Knowledge**: You indicated having extensive knowledge of:
- 7 Ken Suburi detailed mechanics
- 13 Jo Kata complete sequences
- 10 Kumijo details
- 31 Kumijo section breakdowns
- Ken Tai Jo forms and principles
- Henka Waza applications

This knowledge should be **captured in Part IV** of the book.

### Phase 3: Syllabus Integration (Future Sessions)
- Expand technique files with complete how-to instructions
- Document all weapons kata and kumijo in detail
- Create rank-specific progressive training guides
- Integrate syllabus content as Part IV chapters
- Ensure technical accuracy throughout

### Phase 4: Writing and Completion (Ongoing)
- Write articles in chapter order
- Maintain consistency with established frameworks
- Build progressive difficulty
- Review for book-level quality
- Prepare for potential publication

## Success Criteria

A successful restructure means:

1. **Clear Navigation**: Easy to understand book structure with logical progression
2. **Self-Consistent**: All articles use same frameworks and terminology
3. **Progressive**: Each chapter builds on previous ones
4. **Comprehensive**: Complete coverage of foundational through advanced topics
5. **Practical**: Readers can apply what they learn immediately
6. **Reference-Quality**: Iwama syllabus section is detailed enough to learn from
7. **Publication-Ready**: Could be published as book with minimal additional editing

---

## Next Steps (This Session)

1. Get user approval on this structure
2. Update core system files (session-context, decisions, OVERVIEW)
3. Create book progress tracking file
4. Rename/reorganize directories as needed
5. Update command documentation
6. Ready system for educational article writing
