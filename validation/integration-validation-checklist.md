## Cross-Reference Completeness ✓

### Technique ↔ Principle
- [ ] Every technique lists all principles it uses
- [ ] Every principle lists all techniques that use it
- [ ] Links work bi-directionally
- [ ] Explanations of how principle manifests in technique provided
- [ ] Primary vs. secondary principle usage distinguished

### Technique ↔ Common Errors
- [ ] Every technique lists common errors
- [ ] Every error links back to technique(s) where it appears
- [ ] Error explanations reference technique documentation
- [ ] Corrections reference technique's correct execution

### Principle ↔ Common Errors
- [ ] Errors caused by violating principle linked to that principle
- [ ] Principle documentation lists errors from violation
- [ ] Understanding principle connection makes correction clearer

### Principle ↔ Principle
- [ ] Related principles linked
- [ ] Prerequisites identified
- [ ] Complementary principles noted
- [ ] Principles that work together documented

### Teaching Methods ↔ Everything
- [ ] Teaching methods linked to techniques they work for
- [ ] Teaching methods linked to principles they teach
- [ ] Teaching methods linked to errors they correct
- [ ] Methods cross-reference each other

## Navigation ✓

### Indexes Exist
- [ ] Technique index (all techniques listed)
- [ ] Principle index (all principles listed)
- [ ] Error index (all errors listed)
- [ ] Teaching method index (all methods listed)
- [ ] Cross-reference matrices exist

### Finding Information
- [ ] Can find technique by name
- [ ] Can find technique by principle it uses
- [ ] Can find technique by error that appears in it
- [ ] Can find principle by technique that uses it
- [ ] Can find error by technique it appears in
- [ ] Can find error by principle violated
- [ ] Can find teaching method by what it teaches

### Browsing Paths
- [ ] Can browse related techniques
- [ ] Can explore principle connections
- [ ] Can follow error → principle → correction path
- [ ] Can navigate teaching method alternatives

---

## Consistency ✓

### Terminology
- [ ] Same concepts use same names throughout
- [ ] Aliases documented where multiple names exist
- [ ] Japanese terms consistent
- [ ] English translations consistent

### Depth
- [ ] Similar techniques documented to similar depth
- [ ] All principles documented to similar standard
- [ ] Errors documented consistently
- [ ] No major gaps in coverage

### Quality
- [ ] All documentation meets minimum completeness standards
- [ ] Validation levels documented
- [ ] Sources cited consistently
- [ ] Last updated dates tracked

---

## Usability Testing ✓

### Can Support Authoring
- [ ] Test: Try writing a sample chapter - does knowledge base support it?
- [ ] All needed information available
- [ ] Cross-references help find related content
- [ ] Quality sufficient for educational standard

### Can Support Teaching
- [ ] Instructor can use this to plan lessons
- [ ] Error documentation helps diagnosis
- [ ] Teaching methods provide practical guidance
- [ ] Progressive structure supports curriculum

### Can Support Learning
- [ ] Self-directed learner can understand techniques
- [ ] Principles are explained clearly enough
- [ ] Common errors help self-correction
- [ ] Cross-references support deeper exploration

## Minimum Standards for "Integrated"

To be marked "Integrated", knowledge base must have:
- ✓ All documented techniques link to principles they use
- ✓ All documented principles link to techniques using them
- ✓ All documented errors link to techniques and principles
- ✓ Major cross-reference indexes exist and are current
- ✓ Navigation works (can find related content)
- ✓ Terminology is consistent
- ✓ No major orphaned content
- ✓ Usability test passed (can write sample chapter)

To be marked "Comprehensive", must also have:
- ✓ All fundamental techniques documented
- ✓ All core principles documented and validated
- ✓ Extensive error database (100+)
- ✓ All cross-references complete
- ✓ Multiple navigation paths work
- ✓ Can support full curriculum planning
- ✓ Can support complete book authoring
