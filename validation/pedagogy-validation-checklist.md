## Common Errors Database ✓

### Coverage
- [ ] Errors documented across all major techniques
- [ ] Beginner errors comprehensively captured (50+ errors)
- [ ] Intermediate errors documented (20+ errors)
- [ ] Advanced errors documented (10+ errors)
- [ ] Universal errors (across all techniques) identified

### Quality per Error
- [ ] Each error clearly described (observable behavior)
- [ ] Root cause identified for each
- [ ] Principle violation identified for each
- [ ] Correction method provided for each
- [ ] Prevention strategy provided for each

### Organization
- [ ] Errors organized by level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] Errors also organized by technique
- [ ] Errors cross-referenced to principles
- [ ] Related errors linked
- [ ] Index of all errors exists

---

## Learning Progressions ✓

### Stages Documented
- [ ] Clear stages of mastery defined (e.g., 4-5 stages)
- [ ] What each stage looks like described
- [ ] Typical timelines provided
- [ ] Milestones identified
- [ ] Plateaus and breakthroughs documented

### Prerequisites and Dependencies
- [ ] Learning prerequisite map created
- [ ] What must be learned first identified for each technique
- [ ] Progressive sequences documented
- [ ] Dependencies clear

### Progression Models
- [ ] Per technique: progression from beginner → mastery
- [ ] Per principle: understanding progression
- [ ] Overall curriculum progression
- [ ] Testing/evaluation criteria for each level

---

## Teaching Methods ✓

### Method Documentation
- [ ] At least 10-15 distinct teaching methods documented
- [ ] Each method clearly described
- [ ] Each includes implementation steps
- [ ] Each includes when to use / when not to use
- [ ] Each includes effectiveness evidence

### Coverage
- [ ] Methods for demonstration
- [ ] Methods for explanation
- [ ] Methods for correction
- [ ] Drill structures
- [ ] Solo practice methods
- [ ] Partner practice methods

### Validation
- [ ] Each method tested in practice
- [ ] Student feedback collected
- [ ] Effectiveness assessed
- [ ] Limitations noted

---

## Teaching Wisdom Captured ✓

### Instructor Knowledge
- [ ] Personal teaching insights documented
- [ ] Sensei's teaching approaches captured
- [ ] Effective cues and metaphors collected
- [ ] Common teaching mistakes identified

### Student Feedback
- [ ] Student questions documented
- [ ] What students find difficult captured
- [ ] What helps students documented
- [ ] Student learning patterns noted

### Practical Teaching
- [ ] Class structure guidance provided
- [ ] Timing and pacing notes included
- [ ] How to introduce topics documented
- [ ] How to sequence learning outlined

## Minimum Standards for "Complete"

To be marked "Complete", pedagogical documentation must have:
- ✓ At least 50 beginner errors documented with corrections
- ✓ At least 20 intermediate errors documented
- ✓ At least 10 advanced errors documented
- ✓ Learning progression model for curriculum
- ✓ Prerequisites mapped for all techniques
- ✓ At least 10 teaching methods documented
- ✓ Validation through actual teaching experience
- ✓ Cross-references to techniques and principles complete

To be marked "Validated", must also have:
- ✓ Comprehensive error coverage (100+ errors total)
- ✓ Systematic student feedback collected
- ✓ Multiple instructors' approaches documented
- ✓ Methods tested with diverse student populations
- ✓ Peer review by other instructors
