# Blog Series Structure

**Purpose**: Organize blog posts into progressive learning series so readers can build understanding systematically rather than through random posts. Each series builds on previous concepts, creating clear learning pathways.

**Your Approach**: "I would like to write blogs in series so that a reader can take things progressively."

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

## Why Series Structure Matters

**Benefits**:
- Readers can follow clear learning path
- Each post builds on previous concepts
- Can reference earlier posts in series
- Creates narrative through-line
- Encourages readers to return for next installment
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Can package series into guides/ebooks later

**How to Use This**:
- Choose a series based on what interests you
- Write posts in order within series
- Reference previous posts when building on concepts
- Series can run in parallel (work on multiple series)
- Mark completion status to track progress

## Series Writing Strategy

### Approach 1: Complete One Series
- Focus on single series, write all posts in order
- Maintains momentum and consistency
- Readers get complete learning path quickly
- Example: Complete Biomechanics Foundations (6 posts)

### Approach 2: Parallel Series
- Work on multiple series simultaneously
- Alternate between series to avoid burnout
- Provides variety in writing
- Example: Post 1 from Biomechanics, Post 1 from Learning Journey, Post 1 from Peace/Violence

### Approach 3: Priority-Based
- Write highest-value posts from each series first
- Mix foundational with advanced
- Balance technical with philosophical
- Example: One biomechanics, one personal experience, one teaching

### Recommended: Start with Approach 1

Choose one series and complete it. Builds writing momentum, creates clear value for readers, establishes credibility. Suggest starting with:
- **Biomechanics Foundations** (technical strength)
- **Peace and Violence** (unique personal perspective)
- **The Learning Journey** (broadly applicable)
